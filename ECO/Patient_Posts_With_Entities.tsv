0	Sinus infection and pain in collarbone ?	I started having a cough two weeks ago. It started affecting my sinuses about a week ago, so I started taking cold medicine. Instead of getting better, it just got worse. Three days later I would blow my nose and get green-yellow mucous. The next day I woke up and hurt from the crown of my head and down the left side of my head in my ear, jaw, neck, and shoulder. The pain was so bad it even hurt to eat. This is by far the worse sinus infection I have ever had! So, I went to the doctor. He prescribed an antibiotic and an antihistimine (my blood pressure was slightly up, which could have been because of the cold medicine, but it caused him to not want to give me a decongestant). i'm still hurting in my head, ear, and jaw, but not as bad. Mucous is still very colored. But, yesterday, I started hurting in my right shoulder--more like on the tip of the collarbone near my neck. It has some sharp pains, and sometimes dull and achy. I haven't done anything physically that would have caused this type of pain. It doesn't go into the shoulder itself, it just feels like it is in that collarbone. It does hurt also when I move it some and when I cough. Is there any way that this pain could be connected to a sinus infection or even to antibiotics? I'm just wondering because I really have no other explanation to the pain--if this is even an explanation.	sinus infection pain collarbone	i start cough two week ago it start affect sinus week ago i start take cold medicine instead get better get worse three day later i would blow nose get green-yellow mucous the next day i woke hurt crown head left side head ear jaw neck shoulder the pain bad even hurt eat this far worse sinus infection i ever so i go doctor he prescribed antibiotic antihistimine blood pressure slightly could cold medicine cause want give decongestant 'm still hurt head ear jaw bad mucous still color but yesterday i start hurt right shoulder -- like tip collarbone near neck it sharp pain sometimes dull achy i n't do anything physically would cause type pain it n't go shoulder feel like collarbone it hurt also i move i cough is way pain could connect sinus infection even antibiotic i 'm wonder i really explanation pain -- even explanation	Sinus infection_C0037199_sinus infection-pain_C0030193_pain-collarbone_C0008913_collarbone	cough_C0010200_cough-sinuses_C0030471_sinuses-nose_C0028429_nose-mucous_C0026727_mucous-crown_C0010384_crown-head_C0018670_head-head_C0018670_head-ear_C0013443_ear-jaw_C0022359_jaw-neck_C0027530_neck-shoulder_C0037004_shoulder-pain_C0030193_pain-sinus infection_C0037199_sinus infection-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-decongestant_C1306788_decongestant-head_C0018670_head-ear_C0013443_ear-jaw_C0022359_jaw-right shoulder_C0524468_right shoulder-collarbone_C0008913_collarbone-neck_C0027530_neck-sharp pains_C0455270_sharp pains-pain_C0030193_pain-shoulder_C0037004_shoulder-collarbone_C0008913_collarbone-pain_C0030193_pain-sinus infection_C0037199_sinus infection-antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics-pain_C0030193_pain	Sinusitis	C0037199	DefinitionDefinition\nChronic sinusitis is a common condition in which the [[C1510420|cavities]] around [[C0027423|nasal passages]] ([[C0030471|sinuses]]) become inflamed and swollen.

1	Sinus Infection, But a Dry Nose??	I just started suffering with sinus problems the last 2 years. I have had 2 sinus surgeries in the past 12 months. (as well as an infection, I had a large cyst in my left maxillary sinus cavity. It was removed and then grew back.) i'm still having problems. I had a ct scan 3 weeks ago and it showed infection in the entire right maxillary sinus and the left maxillary sinus was about 3/4 full of infection. I also have infection in the frontal sinuses, but not as bad. I have severe sinus pain along the cheeks, nose, and between the eyes. This often turns into a migraine. What's strange is that my nose has been dry the past month and I do not have any drainage coming out. I do feel drainage down my throat and it is sore. I have severe inflammation and when I wake up in the mornings, my face is swollen. Also, for about the past 2 months, my checks will turn bright red, swell up, and be severely hot to the touch. This comes and goes. The past week my gums on the left, top side are really sore and painful. I've been on antibiotics but they do not work. Does anyone out there have any suggestions on what to do? Or what this could be caused from? I worry about the infection spreading.	sinus infection but dry nose	i start suffer sinus problem last 2 year i 2 sinus surgery past 12 month well infection i large cyst left maxillary sinus cavity it remove grow back 'm still problem i ct scan 3 week ago show infection entire right maxillary sinus left maxillary sinus 3/4 full infection i also infection frontal sinus bad i severe sinus pain along cheek nose eye this often turn migraine what 's strange nose dry past month i drainage come i feel drainage throat sore i severe inflammation i wake morning face swollen also past 2 month check turn bright red swell severely hot touch this come go the past week gum left top side really sore painful i 've antibiotic work doe anyone suggestion or could cause i worry infection spread	Sinus Infection_C0037199_sinus infection-But_C0233535_but-Dry Nose_C0231919_dry nose	sinus problems_C0577887_sinus problems-sinus surgeries_C0748725_sinus surgeries-cyst_C0010709_cyst-left maxillary sinus_C0225453_left maxillary sinus-cavity_C0011334_cavity-entire right maxillary sinus_C1289023_entire right maxillary sinus-left maxillary sinus_C0225453_left maxillary sinus-frontal sinuses_C0016734_frontal sinuses-sinus pain_C0522251_sinus pain-cheeks_C0007966_cheeks-nose_C0028429_nose-eyes_C0015392_eyes-migraine_C0149931_migraine-nose_C0028429_nose-drainage_C0012621_drainage-drainage_C0012621_drainage-throat_C0031354_throat-severe inflammation_C0522569_severe inflammation-face_C0015450_face-touch_C0702221_touch-past week_C2987125_past week-gums_C0017562_gums-antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics	Sinusitis	C0037199	DefinitionDefinition\nChronic sinusitis is a common condition in which the [[C1510420|cavities]] around [[C0027423|nasal passages]] ([[C0030471|sinuses]]) become inflamed and swollen.

2	Constant green phlegm for 2 years	I've had constant green phlegm (at first i thought it looked more like a dark almost browning yellow) for 2 years now. It started right after what my doctor told me was a bronchitis. Since then I cough up green chunks every morning. The green chunks are annoying because they get stuck at the back of my throat and sometimes makes breathing annoying when lying down. While I sleep some chunks get stuck on the top of my tonsils. It doesn't completely stop during the day, it keeps me coughing to clear up my throat. What alarms me the most about it is that my doctor has no idea what it is and has given me all kinds of nasal sprays, medications and antibiotics that didn't improve anything at all. I put this post under sinusitis since I was falsely diagnosed with chronic sinusitis by my doctor for a long time even though the  she made me take were negative. The hospital and an ENT specialist also told me I didn't had chronic sinusitis. The ENT says it is not sinus related. The problem is that my immune system is low since then and that I've been having recurring cases of strep throat or laryngitis. The green phlegm however is not clearing up after the strep throat gets treated or the laryngitis clears up. Other then the phlegm, I don't have any other constant symptoms, though at first I had chest pains in the upper middle of my chest but they weren't very frequent. Since I now consider my family doctor almost incompetent, is there a direction I should point her to? Should I go somewhere else? My next step I asked her for is to see an allergist, even though I have not noticed any allergies and even if I change my routine completely or live somewhere else for a while, nothing changes. Can it be stomach related? Can it be lung related? Can it be mold related?	constant green phlegm 2 year	i 've constant green phlegm first thought look like dark almost browning yellow 2 year it start right doctor told bronchitis since i cough green chunk every morning the green chunk annoy get stuck back throat sometimes make breathing annoy lie while i sleep chunk get stuck top tonsil it n't completely stop day keep cough clear throat what alarm doctor idea give kind nasal spray medication antibiotic n't improve anything i put post sinusitis since i falsely diagnose chronic sinusitis doctor long time even though xray make take negative the hospital ent specialist also told i n't chronic sinusitis the ent say sinus related the problem immune system low since i 've recur case strep throat laryngitis the green phlegm however clearing strep throat get treat laryngitis clear other phlegm i n't constant symptom though first i chest pain upper middle chest n't frequent since i consider family doctor almost incompetent direction i point should i go somewhere else my next step i ask see allergist even though i notice allergy even i change routine completely live somewhere else nothing change can stomach related can lung related can mold related	phlegm_C0225378_phlegm	phlegm_C0225378_phlegm-bronchitis_C0006277_bronchitis-chunks_C0679054_chunks-chunks_C0679054_chunks-throat_C0031354_throat-breathing_C0004048_breathing-lying down_C2584317_lying down-chunks_C0679054_chunks-tonsils_C0836921_tonsils-coughing_C0010200_coughing-throat_C0031354_throat-alarms_C0336648_alarms-antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics-sinusitis_C0037199_sinusitis-chronic sinusitis_C0149516_chronic sinusitis-_C0043299_x rays-ENT_C0262471_ent-specialist_C0087009_specialist-chronic sinusitis_C0149516_chronic sinusitis-ENT_C0262471_ent-sinus_C0030471_sinus-immune system_C0020962_immune system-strep throat_C0036689_strep throat-laryngitis_C0023067_laryngitis-phlegm_C0225378_phlegm-strep throat_C0036689_strep throat-laryngitis_C0023067_laryngitis-phlegm_C0225378_phlegm-chest pains_C0008031_chest pains-chest_C0817096_chest-family doctor_C1704221_family doctor-allergist_C0334896_allergist-allergies_C0020517_allergies-nothing_C0442735_nothing-stomach_C0038351_stomach-lung_C0024109_lung	Sinusitis	C0037199	DefinitionDefinition\nChronic sinusitis is a common condition in which the [[C1510420|cavities]] around [[C0027423|nasal passages]] ([[C0030471|sinuses]]) become inflamed and swollen.

4	Any Success with surgery for sinusitis?	Diagnosed with chronic sinusitis by ENT, but so far nothing making a change for the better. Quality of life leaves a lot to be desired for months now. Soon to have a re-evaluation with the ENT and possible recommendation for sinus surgery. BUT, no postings here tell of SUCCESS after a sinus surgery!!! Is success that rare, or is this just that those with success don't need further support and help from other patients? My CT scan showed congenital large Haller cells that are narrowing all other anatomy. Does anyone have any experience with this?

5	Pain even after sinus surgery	I've been to many specialist and couple operations. I've given up. Sinus polyps surgery, deviated septum and the sinus and allergy is still there. Pain behind my right eye, ear, jaw, face, headaches, etc. I don't know what I have. I don't know if it's tmj or sinus infection or both. I've given up. I came to the realization that I may have to live and suffer for the rest of my life. What a sad life to live. Always tired and feeling fatigue. Sinus pressure and headaches throbbing as soon as I wake up. Life sometimes is almost not worth living. I take allergy pills. Pain killers and whatever else I can to not have to feel what I feel on a daily basis.

6	sinus infection from extracted tooth	I got a tooth pulled 3 weeks ago .On the 5th day after the extraction when the pain was tolerable I blow my nose cause I was having a little congestion. Well after I did that the smell and taste of what ever came out of my nose was sickening! I knew right then I had an infection. It smelled like death. The following day I went to the doctor with my problem and he said it may and sounds like it was cause by the extraction to see my dentist again, he gave me 875 amoxicillin for ten days. I seen my dentist a few days later and told him what was going on and he said to just continue the antibiotics and if it didn't clear up to come back. Well ten days later I still have the infection and it is just slightly better if that. At night I can't breath and taking Sudafed 240 mg seemed to stop working for me I have a good nasal spray that helps me breath and clear some of the puss out. I went back to the dentist like they told me too and said I was doing fine. Although I still had the infection they were hesitant to give me more antibiotics. They gave me clindamycin, after reading tons of BAD reviews of the drug I'm not sure I should continue it. The healing of the extraction seems to be slow to me ,doc said it was okay but I'm not sure although there is no pain. I'm starting to think this is not going to be easy to fix .	sinus infection extract tooth	i get tooth pull 3 week ago .on 5th day extraction pain tolerable i blow nose cause i little congestion well i smell taste ever come nose sicken i knew right i infection it smell like death the follow day i go doctor problem say may sound like cause extraction see dentist give 875 amoxicillin ten day i see dentist day later told go say continue antibiotic n't clear come back well ten day later i still infection slightly better at night i ca n't breath take sudafed 240 mg seem stop work i good nasal spray help breath clear pus i go back dentist like told say i fine although i still infection hesitant give antibiotic they give clindamycin reading ton bad review drug i 'm sure i continue the heal extraction seem slow doc say okay i 'm sure although pain i 'm start think go easy fix	sinus infection_C0037199_sinus infection-extracted tooth_C0040440_extracted tooth	a tooth_C0227089_a tooth-extraction_C0684295_extraction-pain_C0030193_pain-nose_C0028429_nose-congestion_C0700148_congestion-smell_C0037361_smell-taste_C0039336_taste-nose_C0028429_nose-death_C0011065_death-extraction_C0684295_extraction-dentist_C0011441_dentist-amoxicillin_C0002645_amoxicillin-dentist_C0011441_dentist-antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics-breath_C0225386_breath-Sudafed_C0700727_sudafed-nasal spray_C2825048_nasal spray-breath_C0225386_breath-dentist_C0011441_dentist-antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics-clindamycin_C0008947_clindamycin-reading_C0034754_reading-extraction_C0684295_extraction-no pain_C0234225_no pain	Sinusitis	C0037199	DefinitionDefinition\nChronic sinusitis is a common condition in which the [[C1510420|cavities]] around [[C0027423|nasal passages]] ([[C0030471|sinuses]]) become inflamed and swollen.

7	Not sure what could be the problem? Elevated Lipase and Amylase.	I've been having sporadic stomach upset where I eat and then feel sick afterwards. It seems to come and go. Also sporadic IBS like symptoms. I could definitely eat better and more often and drink more so that's part of the problem but I'm trying to improve on this. About a month ago I had eaten around 5pm at night and I vomited around 3am and there were a few undigested french fries in there as if they had just been sitting in my stomach. I tried to augment my system with Apple Cider Vinegar. I recently had blood work done as well as Ultrasound, Xray and CT Scans. None of those imaging scans found anything aside from some barium from years ago in my appendix and some scattered diverticula which were not inflamed. FINDINGS: The imaged lung bases are clear. A tiny cyst is incidentally noted in segment five of the liver. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are otherwise normal. The stomach and the small bowel are normal in caliber wall thickness. Some inspissated barium is seen within the appendix, unchanged from comparison study. There is no luminal dilatation of the appendix. The colon is normal in caliber wall thickness. There are a few scattered noninflamed colonic diverticula. There is no abdominal free fluid. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. There are no enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Urinary bladder and prostate are normal. There is no pelvic free fluid or enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. Bone windows reveal no acute bony abnormality. IMPRESSION: No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis. However my fasting blood work showed: Lipase: 67 Fluid Amylase 149 Glucose 74 Anion Gap 17 Calcium 10.3 Globulin 3.9 All were out of range. There is no pain except when I have IBS related pain, almost a direct line across the bottom of my stomach and the sigmoid are where the diverticular pouches are. I get a colonoscopy every 5 years because of Familial Polyposis, but I did test negative on an APC Gene mutation and they said I was back in the general population as far as risk. I've had no issues with polyps at all having been checked every 5 years since I was 20 and I'm now 43. I will do another one just to be safe. Do you feel I should have an upper endoscopy to check my stomach? Sometimes there is a dull ache on the left hand side and I of course worry about stomach or pancreatic cancer, but I have no symptoms as of yet just the blood work mentioned above. Thank You!

8	4 attacks of acute pancreatitis in the past 5 months	Hi I am 24. I had my first attack of pancreatitis in August with my lipase level in the 2000s and had a CT scan and ultrasound. They said I had a gallstone so they removed my gallbladder and said there were two stones and some sludge. In October I had the same pains again and went into the ER and my lipase level was in the 2000s again. They did another CT scan which was clear. They said that they believe it was probably just a stone that had fallen through and wasn’t removed during surgery which had irritated my pancreas but I had passed it. The beginning of November I had the pain return and my lipase was once again in the 2000s. This time around they did an MRCP and checked for autoimmune disorders. The MRCP came back completely clear and the test for the autoimmune came back negative. This one was my fault. The doctors and surgeon never told me I had food/ alcohol restrictions so I had consumed a fair amount of alcohol Halloween weekend and ate a good amount of pumpkin seeds and the pain came while I was eating the seeds. They then told me I needed to be on a low fat diet and absolutely no alcohol. Since then I have been on a strict low fat diet. I don’t eat anything over 3g and I have not touched alcohol since that Halloween weekend. On the 23rd of December I woke up and was having a low fat fat breakfast of lean turkey sausage and egg whites when I felt a really sharp sudden pain. I thought it wasn’t the same since I’m the past it’s been more gradual and progresses from discomfort to pain. This time it was very sudden and more painful than before. I go into the ER and my lipase is once again in the 2000s but this time around the pain is much worse. I am calling the nurses in every 20 minutes because the morphine had worn off and I can’t stand the pain anymore. They up me to Dilauded and the pain starts to get better. In the morning they do a blood test again and my lipase rose to 9000!!! They did a test a couple of hours later to see if there was a lab error and my lipase was in the 6000s. This has never happened with any of my other attacks they always went down over night. They did another MRCP which is completely clear and just recommend I go see a specialist for a EUS. Never had any other symptoms with my attack besides upper abdominal pain first three times it was center left but the last time was center right. Never had issues with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or increased heart rate. Even though I did drink on Halloween weekend I’ve never been a big drinker at all. I would have 1 maybe 2 drinks a week so they do not think it has anything to do with drinking. My cholesterol is good. I don’t take any medications that have a correlation with pancreatitis. I have no family history of pancreas issues. I am having the EUS next week but I am just worried that it wont lead me to any answers. The doctor said 20% of people have idiopathic pancreatitis and that you just learn to manage but I don’t want to keep getting pancreatitis every month to month and a half. All the doctors and surgeon have said they are certain that the first attack was because of gallstones but if it was and then the second attack was because a stone slipped through and the third attack was because I didn’t know you weren’t supposed to drink while the pancreas was healing why did I get it the 4th time? I was trying really hard with my diet and doing well. I am overweight but since this has started happening I’ve been trying to be healthier eating and excercise wise and have lost 35 lbs since August. I was wondering if anyone had any insight or any thoughts on what could be happening. I am scared of this turning into chronic pancreatitis.

9	Distal Pancreatectomy, Splenectomy, Pancreatic Abscesses	Hi, my husband had distal panceatectomy and splenectomy 3 weeks ago, came home for a couple of days and had been in hospital since as he developed infection, it was treated and re-occurred. The CT scan seems to reveal pancreatic absesses, formed (from what I read on the net) from infected pseydocysts. The first operation was complicated with massive blood loss and a part of the infected pancreas wasn't removed due to the complication. He has been on anti-biotics continually for 7 weeks now. My question: We have had a tough time throughout this whole process and I would like to know the complications that can set in from further open surgery, they might re-enter through the original cut to drain all the abscesses. If the draining operation is done and the abscesses clear, is it something that can re-occur? He lost a lot of weight and doesn't need insuline or other enzyme producing medication. Is there a risk to this surgery? Is the pancreatic abscesses the last complication we can expect from the original operation? The doctor's have not been providing a lot of information....	distal pancreatectomy splenectomy pancreatic abscess	hi husband distal panceatectomy splenectomy 3 week ago come home couple day hospital since developed infection treat re-occurred the ct scan seem reveal pancreatic abs form i read net infect pseydocysts the first operation complicate massive blood loss part infect pancreas n't remove due complication he anti-biotics continually 7 week my question we tough time throughout whole process i would like know complication set open surgery might re-enter original cut drain abscess if drain operation do abscess clear something re-occur he lose lot weight n't need insuline enzyme produce medication is risk surgery is pancreatic abscess `` last '' complication expect original operation the doctor 's provide lot information ...

10	History of acute pancreatitis attacks	Dear Doctors, I have a history of acute pancreatitis attacks. I will be giving the whole detail of my history and the current situation as well below: 1st acute pancreatitis ---------------------- August 2008 Amylase 800+ Lipase 1500+ Extreme pain for few days. I was over weight by around 7-9 KGs and work stress was there. I had indigestion and later diarrhea for two days. Triglycerides were high but around 370 After that on the third day i had extreme abdominal pain, did go to local GPs for treatment. I was given gastric pain meds but when it became unbearable I went to hospital the 5th day. I was admitted and the tests were done, I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis for the very first time. I was kept in hospital for a week. No food for three days along with IV fluids and IV pain killers. Started very light food the 5th day and went home the 7th day. I was asked to follow a fat free diet. Ultrasounds were normal. CT Scan was also normal. As this was first attack and also the first case for the local hospital as well. I was allowed low fat diet after around 1 and half month. But the serum amylase / lipase levels did not lower till the first two months. They came down to Amylase 150 and lipase 400 in two months. But even after 6 months the levels were around amylase 100 and lipase 300 so GP also dignosed IBS and started those meds also. Shifted to normal diet after 7 months. Later after a year I felt fine and weight started to increase. I travelled abroad had a little pain episode but managed it using pain killers and antibiotics. GP said it was gastric infection for this episode. Medicine used just after pancraeatitis: omeprazole (4 months), ofloxacin ( one week) , plasenzyme (one month), xanax 0.5mg (once) After six months GP changed to these medicines: Bismol, Librax, Levopraid, xanax 0.25mg (once) 2nd Acute Pancreatitis ---------------------- September 2012 I was bit over weight by around 5-6 KGs and also had gallstones Amylase 1000+ and lipase 1600+. Traglycerides were high around 300 I had another acute pancreatitis attack. GP sent his nurse to give me pain injections and did not eat one whole day. 2nd day pain was less so started liquid diet as per GP. The levels came to normal in 2 months. Followed low fat diet and GP advised gallbladder removal. Ultrasound showed inflammation but later another ultrasound showed resolved inflammation. December 2012 - I got my gall bladder removed. I returned to normal diet after 2 months of gallbladder removal. Medicine used just after pancraeatitis: omeprazole (2 weeks), levofloxacin ( one week) , plasenzyme (one month), Dysen Forte ( 2 days) Normal medicines (continued after first week: Librax, Levopraid, aurora 10mg, xanax 0.25mg (once) 3rd Acute Pancreatitis ---------------------- August 2015 I was over weight by 10 KGs and also had lot of stress going on in life. Triglecrides were borderline high This time I had another acute pancreatitis attack. Amylase 800+ Lipase 1400+. I was admitted to hospital for 3 days. The serum levels started coming down the 2nd day. Ultrasound showed inflammation. Was discharged from hospital the 3rd day. Followed light diet for 10 days and later fat free for another 4 weeks. MRCP came in normal but there was minor narrowing of hepatic duct but that was ignored by two consulting radiologists and also the Gastroentrologist, Endocrinologist and GP. They said it is not linked to pancreatitis as far as they thought. Felt better after 3 months and felt weight was stable. Medicine used just after pancraeatitis: omeprazole (1 month), levofloxacin ( one week) , plasenzyme (two month), levopraid 25mg (thrice daily), xanax 0.5mg (once) Normal medicines (added/continued after first week): Librax, Levopraid, fenoget 200mg, xanax 0.5mg (once) 4th Acute Pancreatitis ---------------------- February 2016 First day test: Amylase 400+ Lipase 850+ Second day test:Amylase 1000+ Lipase 1800+ Triglycerides were very normal and even in mid range. I was already following a low fat diet due to the recent 6 month ago pancreatitis attack. But I was feeling tired a few days before and it seemed that I was losing slow weight. But work stress and general life stress was very high. I had high pain but it was bearable for half of the day, later started increasing. Went to GP who said it gasrtic infection or may be mild gastrititis. Had Blood tested which is mentioned in first day test above. Came back home after having a painkiller shot. GP told to have very light or liquid diet. But when I ate I had bit of increase in pain even with pain killer. I had a second test which is mentioned in Second day test above. Pain was controlled with IM Pain killer but I still went to hospital where they admitted me. I stayed in hospital for 2 days. The Amylase/Lipase levels dropped drastically. But they are still not normal. Its now a month and I am following a no fat or very very very low fat diet like only 1-2g per meal. My MRCP was re-evaluated by another senior radiologist and it was mentioned as unremarkable and no firther radiological study was not asked. Tumor market ca199, autoimmune tests are normal, 4 month sugar test is also normal, H.Pylori test is just borderline. The Endocrinologists says if my weight and life quality does not get better soon he will suggest and endoscopy. GP says my case is ideopathic and IBS or may be some sphnicter may be the case so i should keep stress out of my life. Current Amlyase 80, Current Lipase 135 Medicines given by Hospital gastroentrologist: omeprazole (2 months), , plasenzyme (for first 2 weeks), Creon (continue 10000IU two capsule per meal and one capsule per snack till very low fat diet, and increase meal capsule to three when fat in diet is increased), Ganaton OD 150mg (once for one month) Continuing Medicines by GP: levopraid 25mg (once daily), xanax 0.5mg (once), Librax (once), Fenoget 67mg (once) At the moment I dont have pain and feel fine when I eat meals (quantity is small which i will increase gradually. I have been told by GP and specialist to add Fish and chicken breast but without oil or fat. So Please can any doctor suggest how should I proceed now. I am still off from work as my current weight is 67KG which has an ideal BMI but I feel week. The doctors say that it would be okay if i increase weight by 3-4 KGs. I need to feel strong and healthy so that i can join work in a month or so. I may need to travel abroad so I want to get healthy. I am ready to follow any diet which is suggested and also medication. Looking forward to your advice and guidance.	history acute pancreatitis attack	dear doctor i history acute pancreatitis attack i give whole detail history current situation well 1st acute pancreatitis

11	Pancreatitis - What is causing it?	Hi everyone, I'm 22 years old and I've been having flare-ups since March 2010. I didn't go to the hospital until my recent acute attack in July. Unfortunately, they assumed I was too young for pancreatitis and didn't even test my amylase or lipase and instead assumed I had an ulcer and suggested a follow-up with a gastroenterologist. Several invasive tests later, after finding no ulcer, I was sent for a simple blood test which determined elevated enzymes and diagnosed with pancreatitis. They had me eating jello and chicken broth for about 2 weeks before I could start eating some solids. My symptoms were: chronic abdominal pressure/pain, back pain, trouble breathing especially when lying on my back and anxiety. After a month of healing I felt perfect. Then suddenly... sitting at my computer and eating dinner, my upper abdomen and left chest were in excruciating pain (different from my July attack). Once I could actually move I went to the hospital. They only set me up with a Nurse Practitioner who did a blood test, found my amylase to be about 60ish and sent me home. After that I just kept hurting worse and worse, feeling it in different areas of the abdomen after eating this time. I started feeling nauseous, which I didn't get with the July attack, so nauseous I went about 5 days without so much as a sip of chicken broth before returning to the hospital (I went to a new one this time). They found ketones in my urine (anorexia I assume?), elevated Basophils , High Bili total (it went from a .9 in July to 3.7 in September). Im also iron deficient and found I have some acid reflux when they did an edndoscopy in July. I've had every test imaginable (and multiple times) - MRCP, CT scan, Ultrasound, X rays- all producing normal results. Currently, I'm on max daily doses of Protonix and Pepcid AC (for about 2 weeks now). Obviously, I don't drink alcohol and I never did smoke or drink caffeine. I limit fat intake only and avoid foods which seem to aggravate my stomach. I'm constantly dehydrated no matter how much water I drink and my blood pressure has been high (quite high) for months. I'm all of 110lbs and otherwise healthy. My gastroenterologist suggested an ERCP next but apparently there's a long waiting list to see a specialist for the procedure. I'm starting to lose faith in all these doctors as the emergency room keeps sending me away and my doctors want to diagnose it as chronic pancreatitis with an unknown cause - end of story. I'm only 22 years old and obviously this has been devastating. But the worst part is just not knowing - ANYTHING. So I realized I'd have to find out all I can and ask them to do specific tests/procedures in order to get my diagnosis. Is this auto-immune, chronic, just acute? How do I find out? What kind of blood tests should I request? What red flags should I be looking for? What do I eat? Should I find a new doctor? Any reccommendations of hospitals/doctors that actually provide results/diagnoses? What could be causing it? Absolutely anything at this point would help me. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds. God bless you all!	pancreatitis what cause	hi everyone i 'm 22 year old i 've flare-up since march 2010 i n't go hospital recent acute attack july unfortunately assume i young pancreatitis n't even test amylase lipase instead assume i ulcer suggest follow-up gastroenterologist several invasive test later find ulcer i sent simple blood test determine elevate enzyme diagnose pancreatitis they eat jello chicken broth 2 week i could start eat solid my symptom chronic abdominal pressure/pain back pain trouble breathing especially lie back anxiety after month heal i felt perfect then suddenly ... sit computer eat dinner upper abdomen left chest excruciate pain different july attack once i could actually move i go hospital they set nurse practitioner blood test found amylase 60ish sent home after i kept hurt worse worse feel different area abdomen eat time i start feel nauseous i n't get july attack nauseous i go 5 day without much sip chicken broth return hospital i go new one time they found ketone urine anorexia i assume elevate basophil high bili total go .9 july 3.7 september im also iron deficient found i acid reflux edndoscopy july i 've every test imaginable multiple time mrcp ct scan ultrasound x rays- produce normal result currently i 'm max daily dos protonix pepcid ac 2 week obviously i n't drink alcohol i never smoke drink caffeine i limit fat intake avoid food seem aggravate stomach i 'm constantly dehydrate matter much water i drink blood pressure high quite high month i 'm 110lbs otherwise healthy my gastroenterologist suggest ercp next apparently 's long wait list see specialist procedure i 'm start lose faith doctor emergency room keep send away doctor want diagnose chronic pancreatitis unknown cause end story i 'm 22 year old obviously devastate but worst part know anything so i realize i 'd find i ask specific tests/procedures order get diagnosis is auto-immune chronic acute how i find what kind blood test i request what red flag i look what i eat should i find new doctor any reccommendations hospitals/doctors actually provide results/diagnoses what could cause absolutely anything point would help thanks advance anyone responds god bless	Pancreatitis_C0030305_pancreatitis	attack_C1261512_attack-pancreatitis_C0030305_pancreatitis-amylase_C0002712_amylase-lipase_C0023764_lipase-ulcer_C0041582_ulcer-gastroenterologist_C0259901_gastroenterologist-ulcer_C0041582_ulcer-blood test_C0018941_blood test-elevated enzymes_C0743534_elevated enzymes-pancreatitis_C0030305_pancreatitis-eating_C0013470_eating-jello_C0453543_jello-chicken_C0008051_chicken-eating_C0013470_eating-back pain_C0004604_back pain-breathing_C0004048_breathing-lying_C0600261_lying-back_C0004600_back-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-sitting_C0277814_sitting-eating_C0013470_eating-dinner_C2699739_dinner-upper abdomen_C0230165_upper abdomen-chest_C0817096_chest-excruciating pain_C0278141_excruciating pain-attack_C1261512_attack-Nurse Practitioner_C0028657_nurse practitioner-blood test_C0018941_blood test-amylase_C0002712_amylase-abdomen_C0000726_abdomen-eating_C0013470_eating-attack_C1261512_attack-sip_C2985139_sip-chicken_C0008051_chicken-ketones_C0022634_ketones-urine_C0042036_urine-anorexia_C0003123_anorexia-Basophils_C0004827_basophils-Bili_C0201913_bili-iron_C0302583_iron-acid reflux_C0017168_acid reflux-MRCP_C0994163_mrcp-CT scan_C0040405_ct scan-X rays_C0043309_x rays-max_C0919551_max-Protonix_C0876139_protonix-Pepcid AC_C0591964_pepcid ac-smoke_C0037366_smoke-drink_C0452428_drink-caffeine_C0006644_caffeine-fat intake_C0489488_fat intake-stomach_C0038351_stomach-water_C0043047_water-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-gastroenterologist_C0259901_gastroenterologist-ERCP_C0008310_ercp-waiting list_C0422768_waiting list-specialist_C0087009_specialist-chronic pancreatitis_C0149521_chronic pancreatitis-blood tests_C0018941_blood tests	PancreasesDisorder	C0030305	DefinitionDefinition\nPancreatitis is [[C0021368|inflammation]] in the [[C0030274|pancreas]].

12	Diet and exercise with Pancreatitis	I'm 23 and I was just diagnosed after a bad attack with acute pancreatitis. Diagnosed as unknown causes. It occurred after a night of mild drinking and a day of work, exercise, and a protein shake. I exercise a bunch(probably 4 or 5 times a week) put on 25lbs in the six months leading up to the attack (also quit cigarettes this last year). I weigh 170lbs and I am 5' 10 . Now I think my problem might have been me burning the candle at both ends so to speak.. I exercised a bunch, drank often and smoked marijuana regularly, I also work full time. My attack was very painful and I will never drink again. I want to smoke marijuana occasionally but also think i might have to quit that completely. My question is this. If I eat carefully (less than 30g of fat a day) eat fresh fish, veggies, fruits, soy....If I do that can I still work out 4 to 5 days a week in the hopes to gain a little more weight? No more supplements exempt the occasional vitamin. Would it be dangerous to gain maybe 10-20lbs a year? I just want to weigh 180- 190lb lean or...it's a personal goal...If I cannot I can live with that...I better get used to doing things on my pancreas' terms right?	diet exercise pancreatitis	i 'm 23 i diagnose bad attack acute pancreatitis diagnose unknown cause it occur night mild drinking day work exercise protein shake i exercise bunch probably 4 5 time week put 25lbs six month lead attack also quit cigarette last year i weigh 170lbs i 5 10 '' now i think problem might burning candle end speak.. i exercise bunch drank often smoke marijuana regularly i also work full time my attack painful i never drink i want smoke marijuana occasionally also think might quit completely my question if i eat carefully le 30g fat day eat fresh fish veggie fruit soy ... .if i i still work 4 5 day week hope gain little weight no supplement exempt occasional vitamin would dangerous gain maybe 10-20lbs year i want weigh 180- 190lb lean ...

14	Acute Pancreatitis (Page 1)	I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis when I just turned 21. I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich ,than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E. When im with my friends. I've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana? Well, heres to everybody whos had to go through this damn disease, life aint over yall :wink:	acute pancreatitis page 1	i diagnose acute pancreatitis i turn 21 i 23 i see normal symptom include upper abdominal pain my pain almost always occurs right side like big stich radiates back it go away return i drink i try stay away drinking much possible cant help sometimes i.e when im friend i 've never experienced vomit fever hospitalize i go many test level pretty high i see people say episode my question constitues episode like i say i feel pain everytime i drink go away couple day i really dont think i go life without drinking every the doctor told drink read online ok consume 1 2 drink my question marijuana know affect i know smoking cigarette include marijuana well here everybody who go damn disease life aint yall wink	Acute Pancreatitis_C0001339_acute pancreatitis	acute pancreatitis_C0001339_acute pancreatitis-upper abdominal pain_C0232492_upper abdominal pain-pain_C0030193_pain-back_C0004600_back-drinking_C0001948_drinking-i.E._C0683454_i e-vomiting_C0042963_vomiting-fever_C0015967_fever-pain_C0030193_pain-think_C0039869_think-drinking_C0001948_drinking-drinks_C0452428_drinks-marijuana_C0700268_marijuana-affect_C0001721_affect-smoking cigarettes_C0337667_smoking cigarettes-marijuana_C0700268_marijuana-wink_C0043190_wink	PancreasesDisorder	C0030305	DefinitionDefinition\nPancreatitis is [[C0021368|inflammation]] in the [[C0030274|pancreas]].

17	Low Blood Pressure And Weight Gain	I have been on blood pressure medicine for years. I've been on many diets and it's hard to loose weight no matter what I try. My sister had me use her watch that checks your pulse rate. My pulse was between 63 and 65 (I tried it more than once). That was my resting pulse rate. She thought that was pretty low. We checked my dad's and his was around 75. I'm 49. I go to the gym 3 times a week. My Dad is 79 and has arthritis and doesn't walk much. No matter what diet I try I can't loose weight. I thought after 7 months at the gym I would be loosing weight. After seeing my pulse I remembered about the blood pressure medicine I'm on. I take 50 miliigrams of Atenolol and 20 milligrams of Enalapril every day. Atenolol I remember reading, is a beta blocker and it slows your heart rate down. Is it possible the Atenolol is why my heart rate is so low and actually keeping me from loosing weight? Your feed back is much appreciated!	low blood pressure and weight gain	i blood pressure medicine year i 've many diet 's hard loose weight matter i try my sister use watch check pulse rate my pulse 63 65 i try that rest pulse rate she thought pretty low we checked dad 's around 75 i 'm 49 i go gym 3 time week my dad 79 arthritis n't walk much no matter diet i try i ca n't loose weight i thought 7 month gym i would loose weight after see pulse i remember blood pressure medicine i 'm i take 50 miliigrams atenolol 20 milligram enalapril every day atenolol i remember reading beta blocker slows heart rate is possible atenolol heart rate low actually keep loose weight your feed back much appreciate	Low Blood Pressure_C0020649_low blood pressure-Weight Gain_C0043094_weight gain	blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-pulse rate_C0232117_pulse rate-pulse_C0391850_pulse-pulse rate_C0232117_pulse rate-arthritis_C0003864_arthritis-seeing_C0042789_seeing-pulse_C0391850_pulse-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-Atenolol_C0004147_atenolol-Enalapril_C0014025_enalapril-Atenolol_C0004147_atenolol-reading_C0034754_reading-a beta_C1420510_a beta-beta blocker_C0001645_beta blocker-heart rate_C0018810_heart rate-Atenolol_C0004147_atenolol-heart rate_C0018810_heart rate-feed_C0204695_feed	Low Blood Pressure	C0020649	DefinitionDefinition\nLow blood pressure, also called [[C0020649|hypotension]], would seem to be something to strive for.

19	Low blood pressure while exercising	I am 33 years old and have had strange symptoms, mainly headaches, dizziness and fatigue, I just got all my blood tests back and my blood work looks normal. I was getting an orientation at the YMCA on the circuit. I was only at the 2nd machine when suddenly I felt dizzy. This happens all the time lately, especially if I do more than a lazy workout (lately I can only walk on the treadmill at a slow pace). I guess my face turned extremely red. The personal trainer took my blood pressure. My blood pressure was 95/74 (I accidently posted 85 instead in another section) and the heart rate was 71. She took it again five minutes later and it was 111/83 and heart rate was 79. She stated that I couldn't work out at the Y until I got a doctor's clearance. I guess this shows I could possibly have a heart condition. Even when I walk on the treadmill, I get slightly dizzy and feel like I am going to fall asleep. My resting heart rate used to be at 90, which was pretty high but was normal for me. It is just strange that with exercise, my pulse and blood pressure went down. Anyone hear of such a thing? Very very strange. Anyone else experience this? It's just strange that my resting blood pressure is normal and my heart rate is higher when I am resting as opposed to working out. I just went to the doctor's today and the resting EKG was normal, which doesn't surprise me. He was concerned about my valves. My mom has valve problems (forgot the official name). I will be getting an stress-EKG at a cardiologist in the next few days. In the meantime, I can't exercise or do anything strenuous.	low blood pressure exercise	i 33 year old strange symptom mainly headache dizziness fatigue i get blood test back blood work look normal i get orientation ymca circuit i 2nd machine suddenly i felt dizzy this happens time lately especially i lazy workout lately i walk treadmill slow pace i guess face turn extremely red the personal trainer take blood pressure my blood pressure 95/74 i accidently post 85 instead another section heart rate 71 she take five minute later 111/83 heart rate 79 she state i could n't work y i get doctor 's clearance i guess show i could possibly heart condition even i walk treadmill i get slightly dizzy feel like i go fall asleep my rest heart rate use 90 pretty high normal it strange exercise pulse blood pressure go anyone hear thing very strange anyone else experience it 's strange rest blood pressure normal heart rate higher i rest oppose work i go doctor 's today rest ekg normal n't surprise he concerned valve my mom valve problem forgot official name i get stress-ekg cardiologist next day in meantime i ca n't exercise anything strenuous	Low blood pressure_C0020649_low blood pressure	headaches_C0018681_headaches-dizziness_C0012833_dizziness-fatigue_C0015672_fatigue-orientation_C0029266_orientation-face_C0015450_face-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-heart rate_C0018810_heart rate-heart rate_C0018810_heart rate-clearance_C1382187_clearance-resting heart rate_C1821417_resting heart rate-exercise_C0015259_exercise-pulse_C0391850_pulse-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-heart rate_C0018810_heart rate-today_C0750526_today-EKG_C1623258_ekg-valves_C1186983_valves-valve_C1186983_valve-cardiologist_C0175906_cardiologist	Low Blood Pressure	C0020649	DefinitionDefinition\nLow blood pressure, also called [[C0020649|hypotension]], would seem to be something to strive for.

20	orthostatic hypotension alternates with high blood pressure.	hi- i was recently diagnosed with autonomic orthostatic hypotension. However, I NOW have HIGH blood pressure (uncomfortably high) about half the time, stomach/digestion problems, and low blood pressure and related sx the rest of the time. My doctor gave up in me because he said that true autonomic orthostatic hypotension DOES NOT alternate with high blood pressure. I am currently without a doc and don't know what to do! I take clonidine to lower the high blood pressure when it occurs (usually at night and after eating.) On the days I have the low BP and I am passing out, of course I don't take it. The low BP/fainting started first - tilt table test proved I had AOH - but these new sx are killing me - literally. I feel as if I am going to have a heart attack when my pulse gets so high (130) and then suddenly plummets to 35. (I have an EMS and medical background so I know how to monitor these sx). Everytime I eat, I get SO nauseated and incredibly bloated. PLEASE HELP!!

22	No Diagnosis After 5 Years	My 24 year old daughter has these symptoms. Constantly dizzy, faints 4 -6 times daily. During this time it could last 1min. to 1 hour, at this time she does not respond to pain stimulus, or anything. She cannot hold food,water, meds down. Thus she will become dehydrated. She was on a feeding tube for a while but this had to be removed. She is very tall but weighs very little at this point. Because of fast weight loss and other factors she now has a pacemaker. We have been to numerous Hospitals and Doctors all over the United States. She has yet to be diagnosed. This is her 5th year of being ill.

However, for many people, [[C0020649|low blood pressure]] can cause symptoms of [[C0012833|dizziness]] and [[C0039070|fainting]]. In severe cases, [[C0020649|low blood pressure]] can be life-threatening.\nAlthough [[C0005823|blood pressure]] varies from person to person, a blood pressure reading of 90 millimeters of [[C0025424|mercury]] (mm Hg) or less [[C0871470|systolic blood pressure]] (the top number in a blood pressure reading) or 60 mm Hg or less diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) is generally considered [[C0020649|low blood pressure]].\nThe causes of [[C0020649|low blood pressure]] can range from [[C0011175|dehydration]] to serious medical or surgical disorders. [[C0020649|Low blood pressure]] is treatable, but it 's important to find out what 's causing your condition so that it can be properly treated.SymptomsSymptoms\nFor some people, [[C0020649|low blood pressure]] can signal an underlying problem, especially when it drops suddenly or is accompanied by signs and symptoms such as:\n[[C0012833|Dizziness]] or lightheadedness\nFainting (syncope)\nLack of concentration\nBlurred vision\nNausea\nCold, clammy, pale skin\nRapid, shallow breathing\nFatigue\nDepression\nThirst\nWhen to see a doctor In many instances, [[C0020649|low blood pressure]] is n't serious. If you have consistently [[C1881459|low readings]] but feel fine, your doctor is likely to monitor you during routine exams. Even occasional dizziness or [[C0220870|lightheadedness]] may be a relatively minor problem-- the result of [[C3472705|mild dehydration]] from too much time in [[C0376223|the sun]] or a hot tub, for example. In these situations, it 's not a matter so much of how far, but of how quickly, your [[C0020649|blood pressure drops]].\nStill, it 's important to see your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of [[C0020649|hypotension]] because they sometimes can point to more-serious problems. It can be helpful to keep a record of your symptoms, when they occur and what you were doing at the time.	-Conditions and Diseases\n-Low Blood Pressure and Hypotension

25	BP goes up after meal	In the last few monts I had 4 cases when my BP increased about 10 minute after I eat lunch. From Normal to 150/95. then slowly after few hours went to normal. For the last 3 years i have been eating only the right food and exsersizing 30 to 60 min every day. I have been eating salads and chicken and fish , no pork or beef. My wife is cooking whitout salt, and I'm very strict on eating low sodium food. The salt I replaced with hot peppers. And No problems for the last tree years. And suddenly high blood pressure. In the last 3 monts i had 3 blood tests. fist test total cholesterol 246/HDL 55/VLDL 20/LDL 171 ; TSH 0.146 after 1 month second test total cholesterol 189/HDL 52/VLDL 15/LDL 122 ; after 3 monts Last test total cholesterol 241/HDL 54/VLDL 18/LDL 169 ; TSH 0.302 And because one of the rises of bp after eating was 170/100 my doctor put me toprol 50mg. and he want to test the thyroid levels. While waiting for the lab order to come in the mail I start searching the net for answers. I suspect Hyperthyroid. I start looking about the iodine i take with the food , and I remember that all the cases of high BP are day after I had a fish for diner or lunch. So I don't know the answer. Is the hyper thiroid become hyper active after meal or is always hyper active? Maybe something else is trigering this HBP. I'm afraid to eat. I cant eat the bad food, the good food is not good anymore for me. I just hope that this is something temporary. Also often last mont I have nasal congestions and I'm using afrin.	bp go meal	in last monts i 4 case bp increase 10 minute i eat lunch from normal 150/95 slowly hour go normal for last 3 year eat right food exsersizing 30 60 min every day i eat salad chicken fish pork beef my wife cooking whitout salt i 'm strict eat low sodium food the salt i replace hot pepper and no problem last tree year and suddenly high blood pressure in last 3 monts 3 blood test fist test total cholesterol 246/hdl 55/vldl 20/ldl 171 tsh 0.146 1 month second test total cholesterol 189/hdl 52/vldl 15/ldl 122 3 monts last test total cholesterol 241/hdl 54/vldl 18/ldl 169 tsh 0.302 and one rise bp eat 170/100 doctor put toprol 50mg want test thyroid level while wait lab order come mail i start search net answer i suspect hyperthyroid i start look iodine take food i remember case high bp day i fish diner lunch so i n't know answer is hyper thiroid become hyper active meal always hyper active maybe something else trigering hbp i 'm afraid eat i cant eat bad food good food good anymore i hope something temporary also often last mont i nasal congestion i 'm use afrin	None	lunch_C2697949_lunch-salads_C0453740_salads-chicken_C0008051_chicken-pork_C0452867_pork-beef_C0452849_beef-salt_C0036140_salt-eating_C0013470_eating-low sodium food_C0460286_low sodium food-salt_C0036140_salt-hot peppers_C0697049_hot peppers-tree_C0040811_tree-high blood pressure_C0020538_high blood pressure-blood tests_C0018941_blood tests-fist_C1415548_fist-total cholesterol_C0543421_total cholesterol-TSH_C0040160_tsh-total cholesterol_C0543421_total cholesterol-total cholesterol_C0543421_total cholesterol-TSH_C0040160_tsh-And_C0002838_and-rises_C0246719_rises-eating_C0013470_eating-toprol_C2723006_toprol-thyroid_C0040132_thyroid-Hyperthyroid_C0020550_hyperthyroid-iodine_C0021968_iodine-high BP_C0020538_high bp-lunch_C2697949_lunch-HBP_C0020538_hbp-nasal congestions_C2136984_nasal congestions-afrin_C0718291_afrin	High Blood Pressure and Hypertension	C0020538	DefinitionDefinition\nHigh [[C0005823|blood pressure]] is a common condition in which the [[C0441722|force]] of the blood against your [[C0507850|artery walls]] is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as [[C0018799|heart disease]].\n[[C0005823|Blood pressure]] is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of [[C0683598|resistance]] to [[C0232338|blood flow]] in your [[C0003842|arteries]].

29	Use of Apple Cider Vinegar for Lowering High Blood Presure ? (Page 1)	I checked my blood pressure at a grocery store it read 149/89 and this was on Saturday and I have been online to check on how to reduce it naturally. I started taking apple cider vinegar on Monday and went to the doctor on Tuesday and my blood pressure went down 128/86. I'm not sure if this worked that fast or the machine in the grocery store was wrong.

30	Rapid changes in blood pressure	38 year old male, 5'9 and 145 lbs. - Lately when I take my blood pressure, I notice large changes with each passing minute. For example, I sat down and two minutes later I took my blood pressure. It was 155/88 with a pulse of 87. I waited a minute, took it again, and it was 135/78 with a pulse of 78. I took it a third time and it was 124/78 with a pulse of 73. Should I be worried about high blood pressure? This has happened twice over the past two days. Should I sit longer before taking my initial bp? I do suffer from anxiety attacks, and this could also have something to do with it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	rapid change blood pressure	38 year old male 5 9 '' 145 lb lately i take blood pressure i notice large change passing minute for example i sat two minute later i take blood pressure it 155/88 pulse 87 i wait minute take 135/78 pulse 78 i take third time 124/78 pulse 73 should i worried high blood pressure this happen twice past two day should i sit longer take initial bp i suffer anxiety attack could also something any advice would greatly appreciate	blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure	blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-pulse_C0391850_pulse-pulse_C0391850_pulse-pulse_C0391850_pulse-high blood pressure_C0020538_high blood pressure-anxiety attacks_C0700031_anxiety attacks	High Blood Pressure and Hypertension	C0020538	DefinitionDefinition\nHigh [[C0005823|blood pressure]] is a common condition in which the [[C0441722|force]] of the blood against your [[C0507850|artery walls]] is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as [[C0018799|heart disease]].\n[[C0005823|Blood pressure]] is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of [[C0683598|resistance]] to [[C0232338|blood flow]] in your [[C0003842|arteries]].

31	Fibromyalgia symptoms	Hi all, I will try to keep a super long story short. I went to my GP about a week ago after going to weeks with a growing pains in my right shoulder and upper arm. An xray came out fine, I was prescribed 800mg ibuprofen. Two days later the pain went to my right shoulder/arm with tingling and coldness in that hand.I was prescribed a steroid and muscle relaxer. I went back to my GP today.. Almost a week later. I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and says i have 12 of the 18 trigger points.I have aching muscles in my upper arms, shoulders, neck and down my back. They do not hurt more or less while I'm doing things but do tend to get a tired feeling. Not all spots hurt at once..( One day a shoulder the next day my neck.) But it will remain constant. Also, my joints both shoulders crack/crunch or pop with movement. The Prednisone I was prescribed doesn't seem to be helping much. Im going to an Ortho in less than a week and we will go from there. I do not want to jump the gun but was wondering if these are perhaps symptoms of fibromyalgia?	fibromyalgia symptom	hi i try keep super long story short i go gp week ago go week grow pain right shoulder upper arm an xray come fine i prescribed 800mg ibuprofen two day later pain go right shoulder/arm tingle coldness hand.i prescribed steroid muscle relaxer i go back gp today.. almost week later i diagnose depression/anxiety say 12 18 trigger points.i ache muscle upper arm shoulder neck back they hurt le i 'm thing tend get tire feel not spot hurt once.. one day shoulder next day neck but remain constant also joint shoulder crack/crunch pop movement the prednisone i prescribed n't seem help much im go ortho le week go i want jump gun wonder perhaps symptom fibromyalgia	Fibromyalgia_C0016053_fibromyalgia	growing pains_C0423693_growing pains-right shoulder_C0524468_right shoulder-upper arm_C0446516_upper arm-xray_C0043309_x ray-800 mg ibuprofen_C0986668_800 mg ibuprofen-pain_C0030193_pain-coldness_C0812387_coldness-steroid_C0038317_steroid-muscle_C0026845_muscle-today_C0750526_today-trigger_C0032930_trigger-aching muscles_C0231528_aching muscles-upper arms_C0230348_upper arms-shoulders_C0037004_shoulders-neck_C0027530_neck-back_C0004600_back-tired feeling_C0849970_tired feeling-spots_C0015230_spots-shoulder_C0037004_shoulder-neck_C0027530_neck-joints_C0022417_joints-shoulders_C0037004_shoulders-Prednisone_C0032952_prednisone-fibromyalgia_C0016053_fibromyalgia	Fibromyalgia	C0016053	'DefinitionDefinition\nFibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread [[C0026858|musculoskeletal pain]] accompanied by [[C0015672|fatigue]], [[C0037313|sleep]], [[C0025260|memory]] and mood issues.

33	Calf muscle pain and high cholesterol	I have copied this from a post I made in diagnostics and testing section. I am hoping someone can tell me if this sounds like fibromyalgia or something else. Hello everyone, I am new here and have yet to make an introduction, that will come next. I am truly hoping someone here can help me out. My sister has fibromyalgia and my neurologist recent diagnosed me with it, although I feel he hasnt done any tests that can really confirm it. Anyways, I have had a lot of tests donw this year and I have got copies of all of my results. I am hoping with the communities help or maybe a doctor I can figure out what is going on here. For the past several years the calve muscles in my legs (both of them) have been hurting severely. My entire body hurts and aches but half the time I dont even notice anymore because my legs pains are dwarfing any other pains. I have had an mri of my brain for the purpose of a ms diagnoses, and that appeared to be fine. No strokes or anything like that (thank god i'm only 34). I have tachyardia and high cholesterol so most doctors jump on the, its you heart bandwagon. I have had every test done on my heart as a result and they all come back ok. So with the heart ruled out, I had a bunch of blood tests ran, all were fine except for my cholesterol of course and my RF factor. It was elevated, I can give exact numbers if needed. My ana and all the other tests came back fine so I was reffered to a rheumatologist. She felt my hands and said she could feel they were inflamed, and ran a bunch of other tests. They all came back normal as well. I had asked her to test for muscular dystrophy because of all my symptoms and how long this stuff has been going on, obviously I have done my own research to figure out why I am hurting and to get answers. I know all labs are different, the lab they use seem to have higher reference ranges, not sure if that could cause a problem. Well my rheumatologist drew blood for aldonase serum or something like that. It came back 7.6, but anything under 8.5 is considered normal for the lab. I have had the nerve prick test and it showed mild to moderate neuropathy in my right leg which doctors said most people have that. A mild dehydration in my upper spine the neruologist again said was normal for a full time student looking at a computer. If the exact tests I have done are needed I will supply all of them and the reults, im in just so much pain and noone seems to be able to help me.	calf muscle pain high cholesterol	i copy post i make diagnostics test section i hop someone tell sound like fibromyalgia something else hello everyone i new yet make introduction come next i truly hop someone help my sister fibromyalgia neurologist recent diagnose although i feel hasnt do test really confirm anyways i lot test donw year i get copy result i hop community help maybe doctor i figure go for past several year calve muscle leg hurt severely my entire body hurt ache half time i dont even notice anymore leg pain dwarf pain i mri brain purpose m diagnosis appear fine no stroke anything like thank god 'm 34 i tachyardia high cholesterol doctor jump heart bandwagon i every test do heart result come back ok so heart rule i bunch blood test ran fine except cholesterol course rf factor it elevate i give exact number need my ana test come back fine i reffered rheumatologist she felt hand say could feel inflame ran bunch test they come back normal well i ask test muscular dystrophy symptom long stuff go obviously i do research figure i hurt get answer i know lab different lab use seem higher reference range sure could cause problem well rheumatologist drew blood aldonase serum something like it come back 7.6 anything 8.5 consider normal lab i nerve prick test show mild moderate neuropathy right leg doctor say people a mild dehydration upper spine neruologist say normal full time student look computer if exact test i do need i supply reults im much pain noone seem able help	Calf muscle_C0448482_calf muscle-muscle pain_C0231528_muscle pain-high cholesterol_C1522133_high cholesterol	fibromyalgia_C0016053_fibromyalgia-fibromyalgia_C0016053_fibromyalgia-neurologist_C0237426_neurologist-muscles_C0026845_muscles-legs_C1140621_legs-legs_C1140621_legs-pains_C0030193_pains-other pains_C0237283_other pains-mri_C0024485_mri-brain_C0006104_brain-strokes_C0038454_strokes-high cholesterol_C1522133_high cholesterol-heart_C0018787_heart-heart_C0018787_heart-heart_C0018787_heart-blood tests_C0018941_blood tests-cholesterol_C0008377_cholesterol-ana_C0003243_ana-rheumatologist_C0334889_rheumatologist-hands_C0018563_hands-rheumatologist_C0334889_rheumatologist-serum_C0229671_serum-nerve_C0027740_nerve-prick test_C0430561_prick test-neuropathy_C0442874_neuropathy-right leg_C0230442_right leg-mild dehydration_C3472705_mild dehydration-spine_C0037949_spine-full time student_C1446397_full time student-pain_C0030193_pain	Fibromyalgia	C0016053	'DefinitionDefinition\nFibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread [[C0026858|musculoskeletal pain]] accompanied by [[C0015672|fatigue]], [[C0037313|sleep]], [[C0025260|memory]] and mood issues.

35	Can fibro cause neuro problems?	Hello all. I am getting a little frustrated with doctors lol. I keep getting bounced around & no one seems to have a DX for what is going on with me. The neurologist I am seeing now seems to think I have fibromyalgia but I am a little confused because a lot of what I have going on (other than the pain) seems to be neuro symptoms. I am hesitant to believe I have fibro since it seems to be a catch all DX for when they cannot figure out what is wrong & I just don't believe my symptoms are the same for fibro. So my questions is... can fibro cause/does anyone else have these symptoms with fibro??? Migraines, numbness/tingling of extremities & face, kaliedoscoped vision, small tremors in hands, recurring sinus/upper respiratory infections, dizziness, muted sensations, unexplained bruising on lower back, hives/rashes, swelling of extremities? I've tried to do some research online about fibro but most of what I read deals with the muscle pain, sheath tears, & cognitive issues. Any info would be greatly appreciated.

37	Pain in palm of hand while gripping something??	Hi everyone I was diagnosed with CTS a few months ago . I was having that tell tale sign of fingers going numb for months before but it wasn't every night. I also started to get tingly fingers and hands doing my job duties. Finally went to the dr and she said she suspects CTS. She sent me to get a nerve conduction test and that showed i had CTS in both hands , but more in my right. I was surprised I had it because I do not work a desk job. I work with adults that have developmental disabilities. But, I do lift weights and do crossfit, so I think it may be caused from that. Anyways, I was wondering if you guys with CTS also feel a pain in the meaty part of your palm when gripping items? Maybe not so much as a pain, but cramping and tiredness? If I'm using a screw driver, I have to stop a few times . I had to brush off my car today and scrape it (Silly Canada, dumping snow already) and I had to take many breaks because my hands were cramping up. TIA	pain palm hand grip something	hi everyone i diagnose ct month ago i tell tale sign finger go numb month n't every night i also start get tingly finger hand job duty finally go dr say suspect ct she sent get nerve conduction test show ct hand right i surprised i i work desk job i work adult developmental disability but i lift weight crossfit i think may cause anyways i wonder guy ct also feel pain meaty part palm grip item maybe much pain cramp tiredness if i 'm use screw driver i stop time i brush car today scrape silly canada dump snow already i take many break hand cramp tia	Pain in palm_C2032326_pain in palm-palm of hand_C0817662_palm of hand	CTS_C1421224_cts-fingers_C0016129_fingers-fingers_C0016129_fingers-hands_C0018563_hands-CTS_C1421224_cts-nerve conduction test_C0200125_nerve conduction test-CTS_C1421224_cts-both hands_C0230377_both hands-adults_C0001675_adults-developmental disabilities_C0008073_developmental disabilities-guys_C0018408_guys-CTS_C1421224_cts-pain_C0030193_pain-palm_C0230373_palm-pain_C0030193_pain-cramping_C0026821_cramping-tiredness_C0015672_tiredness-screw_C0005975_screw-today_C0750526_today-Canada_C0006823_canada-dumping_C0221542_dumping-snow_C0037386_snow-hands_C0018563_hands-TIA_C0007787_tia	Carpal Tunnel Syndrome	C0007286	DefinitionDefinition\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a progressively painful hand and arm condition caused by a [[C0273482|pinched nerve]] in your [[C0043262|wrist]].

39	Sore wrist for two weeks, worst in morning, gets better in day	34 year old male, 220 lbs, 6'3'', white Pain around wrist, seems near the pisiform bone; whatever tendon is there?, and finger motion has no bearing on pain Out of the blue, I woke up two Mondays ago with a very sore wrist. I can't remember any injury, maybe I slept on it wrong? I can't even hold a cup of coffee right when I get up. I wake up with an ache on the underside of my wrist, pinky side every day. Usually, I get out of bed bearing weight on the wrist, but it can't bear any weight. I have tried immobilizing it using a brace, but it seems to make it worse. I am using advil and cold packs, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything. What makes it better is use and specifically when I actively 'stretch into the pain and hold. I did this yesterday morning and it got to the point where I almost forgot about my aching wrist. It seems rest is brings back my pain. At this point, I can almost use my wrist normally, (aka holding things, bearing weight on it, etc) The doctor's office told me to continue icing and using advil and call back in a couple of weeks if it continues. What on earth could this possible be? - Rheumatoid arthritis? - Tendonitis? - Carpal tunnel syndrome?

40	Pillar Pain months after surgery.	Approximately 6 months ago I underwent open CTR surgery on both hands. The diagnosis was confirmed by an EMG and Nerve conduction study. This was directly following a traumatic event and after a second opinion, it was determined that I was suffering from post-traumatic carpal tunnel syndrome. I have not experienced any of the original symptoms since the release of both carpal tunnels and am thrilled to have had a favorable outcome in that respect. I experienced pain and tenderness on either side of the incisions that did not seem to fade as quickly as the healing of the incision itself. I mentioned this to my surgeon and he advised me that this was a condition called pillar pain that happens occasionally in OCTR patients. He suggested I massage the incision vigorously as well as the surrounding areas that had pain and tenderness. My concern now is that after doing the prescribed exercises and massaging my hands (even though it is painful, I stick to this regimen daily) as the surgeon suggested I am starting to reach a level of declining relief. Some 6 months later I am still suffering from pillar pain despite following all of the post-op advice to the letter. The surgeon has recently released me after a discussion on the likelyhood that the pillar pain could very well be permanent. I was even given a permanent partial disability rating due to this and I have to admit it took me by surprise. My question is what causes of pillar pain could make it permanent? I'm certain the diagnosis (CTS) is correct considering all of the diagnostic evidence and the onset of this immediately following a trauma to both wrists. Steroid injections offered temporary relief (approx. 6 - 8 weeks) and were tried with multiple types in multiple sessions. Splints helped to some degree and unfortunately there wasn't much I could change about the use of my hands other than resting them considering it was a trauma causing this (I had no problems prior to this injury). I even tried physical therapy for several months doing specific stretching (nerve gliding) that offered some relief for short periods of time prior to considering surgery. I was aware of the popular complications with the operation and opted to accept these considering I had exhausted all non surgical treatment avenues. I wasn't very familiar with pillar pain or its causes because very little is mentioned on it outside of professional papers (per my internet search, and I cannot access these for details). Do some OCTR patients experience pillar pain permanently? There isn't much literature on this available on the internet in regard to duration or what factors can cause this to be permanent. I appreciate any response from people experiencing this specific problem or any professional insight on this topic. *Edited to add further insight on the diagnosis*	pillar pain month surgery	approximately 6 month ago i underwent open ctr surgery hand the diagnosis confirm emg nerve conduction study this directly follow traumatic event second opinion determine i suffer `` post-traumatic carpal tunnel syndrome '' i experienced original symptom since release carpal tunnel thrill favorable outcome respect i experienced pain tenderness either side incision seem fade quickly heal incision i mention surgeon advise condition call `` pillar pain '' happens occasionally octr patient he suggest i massage incision vigorously well surround area pain tenderness my concern prescribed exercise massage hand even though painful i stick regimen daily surgeon suggest i start reach level decline relief some 6 month later i still suffer pillar pain despite follow post-op advice letter the surgeon recently release discussion likelyhood pillar pain could well permanent i even give permanent partial disability rating due i admit take surprise my question cause pillar pain could make permanent i 'm certain diagnosis ct correct consider diagnostic evidence onset immediately follow trauma wrist steroid injection offer temporary relief approx 6 8 week try multiple type multiple session splint help degree unfortunately n't much i could change use hand rest consider trauma cause i problem prior injury i even try physical therapy several month specific stretch nerve glide offer relief short period time prior consider surgery i aware `` popular '' complication operation opt accept consider i exhaust non surgical treatment avenue i n't familiar pillar pain cause little mention outside professional paper per internet search i access detail do octr patient experience pillar pain permanently there n't much literature available internet regard duration factor cause permanent i appreciate response people experience specific problem professional insight topic *edited add insight diagnosis*	Pain_C0030193_pain-surgery_C0543467_surgery	CTR_C1413085_ctr-surgery_C0543467_surgery-both hands_C0230377_both hands-EMG_C0013839_emg-Nerve conduction study_C0200125_nerve conduction study-second opinion_C1314202_second opinion-carpal tunnel syndrome_C0007286_carpal tunnel syndrome-carpal tunnels_C0225091_carpal tunnels-pain and tenderness_C0234242_pain and tenderness-incisions_C0184898_incisions-incision_C0184898_incision-surgeon_C0582175_surgeon-pain_C0030193_pain-massage_C3536731_massage-incision_C0184898_incision-pain and tenderness_C0234242_pain and tenderness-exercises_C0015259_exercises-hands_C0018563_hands-surgeon_C0582175_surgeon-pain_C0030193_pain-letter_C2360551_letter-surgeon_C0582175_surgeon-discussion_C0557061_discussion-pain_C0030193_pain-pain_C0030193_pain-CTS_C1421224_cts-trauma_C0548346_trauma-wrists_C0043262_wrists-Steroid injections_C1261311_steroid injections-Splints_C0038009_splints-hands_C0018563_hands-trauma_C0548346_trauma-physical therapy_C0949766_physical therapy-stretching_C0600080_stretching-nerve_C0027740_nerve-gliding_C0336966_gliding-surgery_C0543467_surgery-operation_C0543467_operation-non surgical treatment_C2363849_non surgical treatment-pain_C0030193_pain-pain_C0030193_pain-insight_C0233820_insight-insight_C0233820_insight	Carpal Tunnel Syndrome	C0007286	DefinitionDefinition\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a progressively painful hand and arm condition caused by a [[C0273482|pinched nerve]] in your [[C0043262|wrist]].

41	Recovery after Carpal tunnel Surgery? (Page 1)	I am scheduled for right hnad surgery on September 25. My main question is, how long is the minimum recommended time off work a person should be taking? I do a lot of things with my hands and of course i am right handed. Lots of computer typing, stapling, hole punching and a lot of grasping like opening ziplock bags of things as all our orders are kept in those. Even now I am dropping things, have pain shooting up both arms and even have headaches and neck pain from it. I even already have the pillar pain, so I'm hoping the after surgery effects wont be waaaay more severe than what i have currently, but I don't wnat to go back too soon and cause healing problems. I don't get paid for the time off, hence the minimum time away that is considered safe. I realize everyone heals differently, so its obviously a lose guess, but i would be very interetsed in others work experiences and how long they needed off, just so i can have a ball park as to what to tell the boss.

42	Hard to make a fist. Help!	I was recently diagnosed with carpal tunnel. The doctor who performed the tests said it was a mild to moderate case. Although my hand always hurts, sometimes it is much more tolerable than other times. This happened to be one of the rare days where the pain wasn't as bad. I wonder if I went on a day when the pain was very bad if the results would have shown a more serious case? I am writing mainly because it always hurts to make a fist. Some days it is worse than others, but it always hurts nonetheless. The pain feels like it is mainly in my middle finger. I can feel a bump/pop in the base of my palm when I try to make a fist. I can do it, but I have to squeeze hard and it hurts very bad. If i accidentally fall asleep without my wrist brace, I won't even be able to close my hand at all when I wake up. I'm just wondering if this is a result of my carpal tunnel. I assume it is, but I can't find any information about someone with my specific problem on the Internet. I do deal with the regular side effects as well such as tingling and numbness. Is the pain when I try to close my hand normal too? Any information would be appreciated. If it helps to know, I am a 22 year old male.

43	Omeprazole	I just saw my ENT doctor about throat problems (coughing, trouble with hacking mucus, mucus not coming up with cough and hacking), he said all my problems were due to acid reflux and prescribed me Omeprazole (he also told me to take less of the ranitidine, which I admittedly had been taking a lot, and to not take Tums because the calcium causes more acid), and then gave me a referal to a gastroenterologist. My question is regarding the Omeprazole. My doctor didn't say how long I should take it. I know you're not supposed to take it long term, but I don't know why not. The box says not to take it for more than 14 days, and says to only take once a day. My doctor said to take twice a day, and didn't say when I should stop.

44	constant heartburn, indigestion, and gas (Page 1)	This may be a little long, but please read, this explains my whole story. In need of help, and very curious if anyone else in this world is experiencing these problems that I am having. For the past five years, I have been going through the worst heartburn/indigestion/gas issues of my life. The medication that I take pretty much takes care of the heartburn part, but I never seem to escape the billion pounds of gas in my stomach that can never been relieved (even with hundreds of burps)!! Most of the time it feels like I cant’ breath, like someone has there hands around my throat, which makes everything in life hard. I have seen numerous doctors and specialists, and have gone through almost every possible procedure to try to render a concrete diagnosis that has not been found. I have also tried EVERY over the counter medication there is known to man (sometimes in dangerously excessive amounts)!! It all started out with (of course) the heartburn and the bloating; I went to see my family doctor who in turn prescribed Nexium. At first it worked really well, no problems; but after about a few months, I seemed to become immune on the drug, and it didn’t work anymore. I went back to the family doctor who ordered me to get an upper GI barium test. This of course did prove I have acid reflux disease, but no other apparent problems. I continued on the Nexium for a little longer and still no improvement. Again, went back to the family doctor, practically begging, and telling him that this isn’t working. Needless to say, we tried about 3 other types of prescriptions (Previcid, Acifex, etc., etc.). After much frustration, I ended up switching doctors. Told my new doctor everything that I went through and he ordered and upper GI endoscopy. I went back on the Nexium since that was the only medication that gave me little relief. The upper endoscopy showed nothing, and the specialist, pretty much shoved me out the door, and prescribed me with an IBS medication, when I do not have many symptoms of IBS. I probably would have stayed on the Nexium, but my (so wonderful) insurance company decided to deny my prescription (due to the lack of notes with my family doctor). The insurance company wants you to try every possible other prescription before Nexium because the cost is so high, about $400.00 a month without insurance. Again, much more frustration, I tried more alternatives, changed more in my diet, tried not to stress out. Nothing seemed to work. Went to see my family doctor again, he sent me to see another specialist. This time, it was one that concentrates more on the lower GI tract. At this time, but doctors believes that a bacteria must be causing this, if nothing else is working. He did not believe that it is due to swallowed air because that tends to be more in patients with asthma or respiratory problems. So, I went to see this doctor (latest one). He ordered me to do a stool sample, and a genetics test for Celtic disease. I did get some results back, according to the results of my stool sample, I have a bad bacteria (Pseudomonas Aeruginosa), which the doctor told me could only be contracted from hospitals or nursing homes (and I have never been hospitalized, but I have visited nursing homes before). He also indicated that I have no GOOD bacteria whatsoever in my stool. The Celtic disease results only indicated that I have only few of the indications to suggest the disease, but it could not be specifically determined. He gave me some natural supplements to remove the bad bacteria from my system, and replace the good. 2 months later, no improvement. The specialist told me the only step left, if the supplements didn’t work), was to try the diet for Celtic disease. This means I have to cut a lot of food items out of my life. But I have realized over the 5 years, that it really doesn’t matter what I eat, I still always feel the same way. Of course some things will make it a little worse (i.e., tomatoes, tomato sauce), but it always stays constant. I feel like I am at a dead end here, with no where to go, and sometimes I just want to crawl in a hole and die. And it feels to me that there is no real urgency in the science of gastroenterology. I always get the sense (anytime I see a doctor), that they feel I am making it up, or it is not serious, but it is serious to me!! Please provide me with any feedback you might have, you any experiences. I would greatly appreciate it. Thank You, and Have a Great Day.

45	How to Cure Acid Reflux Disease Naturally	Hi, My brother's girlfriend works in a health food and herb store, she's told me that deglycyrrhizinated licorice (or licorice root...in supplement form) can be used to help relax the stomach. Basically what she said was that it acts as a natural stomach coater, it also helps with digestion and heartburn (and inflammed muscles for those who have nasty chest and back pains) to ease that icky burning up the esophagus. If you're going to try it, make sureee and i can't stress it enough that it's Deglycyrrhizinated licorice, because if it's glycyrrhizinated then it may give u high blood pressure. So far it seems to relax my GERD quite a bit, it may not be a complete solution to medication but it's worth a try. Anyway, take care.	how cure acid reflux disease naturally	hi my brother 's girlfriend work health food herb store 's told deglycyrrhizinated licorice licorice root ... supplement form use help relax stomach basically say act natural stomach coater also help digestion heartburn inflammed muscle nasty chest back pain ease icky burning esophagus if 're go try make sureee ca n't stress enough 's deglycyrrhizinated licorice 's glycyrrhizinated may give u high blood pressure so far seem relax gerd quite bit may complete solution medication 's worth try anyway take care	Cure_C1511495_cure-Acid Reflux Disease_C0017168_acid reflux disease	health food_C0282679_health food-herb_C0019240_herb-licorice_C0086555_licorice-licorice root_C2756786_licorice root-stomach_C0038351_stomach-stomach_C0038351_stomach-digestion_C0012238_digestion-heartburn_C0018834_heartburn-muscles_C0026845_muscles-chest_C0817096_chest-back pains_C0004604_back pains-burning_C0085624_burning-esophagus_C0014876_esophagus-licorice_C0086555_licorice-high blood pressure_C0020538_high blood pressure-GERD_C0017168_gerd	Acid Reflux	C0017168	'DefinitionDefinition\nGastroesophageal reflux disease ([[C0017168|GERD]]) is a chronic [[C0012242|digestive disease]] that occurs when stomach acid or, occasionally, [[C0005388|bile]] flows back ([[C0017168|refluxes]]) into your food pipe ([[C0014876|esophagus]]).

46	Acid Reflux Help	One year ago I was suffering from severe reflux. My GI doctor prescribed a PPI, which I took for several weeks. The reflux stopped, but I started to get nausea, gas, abdominal pain, so I stopped taking the PPIs. I ended up traveling up to a clinic in Washington state. The doctor name was Jonathan Wright. They gave me a Heidelberg pH Test and found that I had weak stomach acid. I was told that I should have never been prescribed a PPI, for low stomach acid. After running several different tests, I was told that the PPIs threw my digestive process out of balance. The doctor told me that I was seriously deficient in several vitamin and minerals, especially B vitamins. They prescribed a natural product to rebalance my digestive process and vitamins and minerals. The reflux and nausea did not reoccur. Dr. Wright had previously suggested that I should have a second Heidelberg test, to monitor the treatment protocol he set up for me. Two months ago I went back to Dr. Wrights clinic and had a second Heidelberg test done. The test indicated that my digestive process has returned to normal and my vitamin and mineral absorption had greatly improved.	acid reflux help	one year ago i suffer severe reflux my gi doctor prescribed ppi i take several week the reflux stop i start get nausea gas abdominal pain i stop take ppis i end travel clinic washington state the doctor name jonathan wright they give heidelberg ph test found i weak stomach acid i told i never prescribed ppi low stomach acid after run several different test i told ppis threw digestive process balance the doctor told i seriously deficient several vitamin mineral especially b vitamin they prescribed natural product rebalance digestive process vitamin mineral the reflux nausea reoccur dr. wright previously suggest i second heidelberg test monitor treatment protocol set two month ago i go back dr. wright clinic second heidelberg test do the test indicate digestive process return normal vitamin mineral absorption greatly improve	Acid Reflux_C0017168_acid reflux	reflux_C0017168_reflux-PPI_C0871125_ppi-reflux_C0017168_reflux-nausea_C0027497_nausea-gas_C0017110_gas-abdominal pain_C0000737_abdominal pain-traveling_C0040802_traveling-Washington state_C0043038_washington state-Wright_C1510508_wright-pH Test_C0785113_ph test-stomach_C0038351_stomach-PPI_C0871125_ppi-stomach_C0038351_stomach-running_C0035953_running-minerals_C0026162_minerals-B vitamins_C0042849_b vitamins-natural product_C1566558_natural product-minerals_C0026162_minerals-reflux_C0017168_reflux-nausea_C0027497_nausea-Wright_C1510508_wright-Heidelberg test_C0696136_heidelberg test-Wrights_C1261259_wrights-Heidelberg test_C0696136_heidelberg test-mineral_C0026162_mineral-absorption_C0000854_absorption	Acid Reflux	C0017168	'DefinitionDefinition\nGastroesophageal reflux disease ([[C0017168|GERD]]) is a chronic [[C0012242|digestive disease]] that occurs when stomach acid or, occasionally, [[C0005388|bile]] flows back ([[C0017168|refluxes]]) into your food pipe ([[C0014876|esophagus]]).

47	PPI's (Proton Pump Inhibitors) and Your Body	There are many published studies that describe the various side effects associated with the H2 antagonist (PPI) products. When the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notifies doctors about the side effects, of PPIs, why would you put yourself at risk by taking them? If a person goes to a Gastroenterologist with esophageal reflux (GERD), virtually every GI doctor will automatically prescribe a PPI, without doing any kind of testing. After taking the PPI for a while, the Gastroenterologist may refer you to a doctor that will perform an endoscopy or colonoscopy. These procedures, are not accurate enough to diagnose Hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid), Hyperchlorhydria (high stomach acid), or Normal stomach acid. In either case, the patient will be prescribed more PPIs. Some doctors will do testing that involves surgically attaching a device to the wall of your esophagus. The device will remain attached to your esophagus for 24 hours, while the pH of the esophageal fluid is being monitored, by a recorder that you wear. At the end of this test the doctor, will tell you something you already knew!!! YOU HAVE REFLUX Worst case scenario, the patient may undergo exploratory surgery, which may result in unnecessary organs being removed. Gastroenterologist and many other medical specialty doctors automatically assume that patients with Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) are over producing Hydrochloric acid (HCL). Unfortunately in many instances this assumption is wrong. The symptoms associated with excess acid production (hyperchlorhydria) and low stomach acid (hypochlorhydria) are identical, making it very difficult to diagnose, without a pH diagnostic test. Both conditions will cause reflux, belching, bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and/or constipation, flatulence, etc. Before taking any type of PPI or acid reducing medication, have your doctor give you a pH Diagnostic test, or Gastrogram. It will tell the doctor exactly what is going on in your digestive process. The test is accurate, and reliable without the discomfort associated with other procedures. It is done in the doctor's office, without the use of sedation. If you are actually over producing stomach acid, a natural medication, similar to the buffering enzyme that is produced by the pancreas, is available. If you are not producing enough stomach, a natural medication is also available to bring pH back into balance. When it comes to your health and longevity, a pH diagnostic test, pH capsule test, or pH Gastrogram is one of the best investments you will ever make.	ppi 's proton pump inhibitor your body	there many publish study describe various side effect associate h2 antagonist ppi product when american food drug administration fda notifies doctor side effect ppis would put risk take if person go gastroenterologist esophageal reflux gerd virtually every gi doctor automatically prescribe ppi without kind test after take ppi gastroenterologist may refer doctor perform endoscopy colonoscopy these procedure accurate enough diagnose hypochlorhydria low stomach acid hyperchlorhydria high stomach acid normal stomach acid in either case patient prescribed ppis some doctor test involves surgically attach device wall esophagus the device remain attach esophagus 24 hour ph esophageal fluid monitor recorder wear at end test doctor tell something already knew `` you have reflux '' worst case scenario patient may undergo exploratory surgery may result `` unnecessary organ '' remove gastroenterologist many medical specialty doctor automatically assume patient gastroesophageal reflux gerd produce hydrochloric acid hcl unfortunately many instance assumption wrong the symptom associate excess acid production hyperchlorhydria low stomach acid hypochlorhydria identical make difficult diagnose without ph diagnostic test both condition cause reflux belching bloating abdominal pain nausea diarrhea and/or constipation flatulence etc before take type ppi acid reduce medication doctor give ph diagnostic test gastrogram it tell doctor exactly go digestive process the test accurate reliable without discomfort associate procedure it do doctor 's office without use sedation if actually produce stomach acid natural medication similar buffering enzyme produce pancreas available if produce enough stomach natural medication also available bring ph back balance when come health longevity ph diagnostic test ph capsule test ph gastrogram one best investment ever make	PPI_C0871125_ppi-Proton Pump Inhibitors_C0358591_proton pump inhibitors	studies_C0947630_studies-H2 antagonist_C0019593_h2 antagonist-PPI_C0871125_ppi-Gastroenterologist_C0259901_gastroenterologist-esophageal reflux_C0017168_esophageal reflux-GERD_C0017168_gerd-PPI_C0871125_ppi-PPI_C0871125_ppi-Gastroenterologist_C0259901_gastroenterologist-endoscopy_C0014245_endoscopy-colonoscopy_C0009378_colonoscopy-Hypochlorhydria_C0079581_hypochlorhydria-stomach_C0038351_stomach-Hyperchlorhydria_C0151713_hyperchlorhydria-stomach_C0038351_stomach-Normal stomach_C0577026_normal stomach-esophagus_C0014876_esophagus-esophagus_C0014876_esophagus-esophageal_C0014852_esophageal-recorder_C1705115_recorder-REFLUX_C0017168_reflux-exploratory surgery_C1880637_exploratory surgery-Gastroenterologist_C0259901_gastroenterologist-medical specialty_C0037778_medical specialty-Gastroesophageal reflux_C0017168_gastroesophageal reflux-GERD_C0017168_gerd-Hydrochloric acid_C0020259_hydrochloric acid-HCL_C0020259_hcl-excess acid_C0728725_excess acid-hyperchlorhydria_C0151713_hyperchlorhydria-stomach_C0038351_stomach-hypochlorhydria_C0079581_hypochlorhydria-reflux_C0017168_reflux-belching_C0014724_belching-bloating , abdominal_C1291077_bloating abdominal-abdominal pain , nausea_C0151263_abdominal pain nausea-diarrhea_C0011991_diarrhea-constipation_C0009806_constipation-flatulence_C0016204_flatulence-PPI_C0871125_ppi-discomfort_C0231218_discomfort-sedation_C0344106_sedation-stomach_C0038351_stomach-pancreas_C0030274_pancreas-stomach_C0038351_stomach-longevity_C0023980_longevity	Acid Reflux	C0017168	'DefinitionDefinition\nGastroesophageal reflux disease ([[C0017168|GERD]]) is a chronic [[C0012242|digestive disease]] that occurs when stomach acid or, occasionally, [[C0005388|bile]] flows back ([[C0017168|refluxes]]) into your food pipe ([[C0014876|esophagus]]).

48	PPI's Prilosec & Nexium - causes gastritus (Worse than reflu	PPI's - Prilosec & Nexium. Severe reactions & damage are happening to many people. Many of them unaware that their solution is causing similar but a new host of problems. I am suffering with gastritus and have had the worst year of my life physically since taking prilosec. Many years ago I had reflux from a high stress job and coffee, etc.. After a parent died, and a severe reflux bout, I didn't understand reflux. No one explained eating lots of small meals.. or laying down on an incline, or sitting up three hours after you eat.. or cutting out wine, chocolate, sauce, spices coffee.. though I figured some of that out. Instead I too Nexium for SIX Months... fearing to get off it.. but I couldnt stop the nerves I had and my mother realized it WAS the medicine. So I stopped and slowly got back to normal.. that was in my 30s. Flash forward.... some reflux again in my 40s... I find out I have POLYPS in my gallbladder.. WHY? welll reading on reactions it says some users get stomach polyps too!. Not good. But not realizing I took Prilsec again for two months. Older and more vulnerable to reactions, I went by ambulence for TWICE for the first time in my life after taking prilosec. I also had a knot under my stomach that got worse and worse.. all the while thinking it safe and not strong enough for reflux going wild..

SLEEP APNIA!! digestion impossible at night a NIGHTMARE. Weeks off the prilosec and I could walk outside take a shower more confidently but the rumbling in my stomach made my sides hurt for MANY months and I felt like I had to hold the walls when walking down stairs...!! insane I know I was an athlete and this really ruined my year. Friends drove me around for months.. and then slowly helped me drive again.. with them in the car. My arm and fingers were getting numb after eating. Spice would make me feel like I could pass out! But it was just pressure. I still cannot get up in the morning and not need to eat quickly or I will face horrible gastritus making me feel like I could pass out. Heart is good.. every test...moniter, you name it..... Endoscopy all good no hpylori, no woman cancers... all checked... even a head scan..all ok but now I am radiated! oh well thanks for the additional risk factor. It was prilosec and the generic equivalent being dished out by doctors who think they need to give you something for you to want to go there. The FDA has been aware of the over the counter and prescription PPI's (omeprazole and other similar names) and they are not properly warning people. REAL DAMAGE is being done to countless people Please google prilosec ruined my life.. where a college kid was totally messed up by it. Also google prilosec reactions etc..

49	Prednisone caused GERD ?	Hi all, I took Prednisone for an autoimmune condition a little over a year ago. I had to be on pretty high doses of the stuff for six weeks, then tapered down. My doctor prescribed me Prilosec with it, which I took daily until the last week or two of treatment when I was tapering off of it and on what I considered very small doses (5 mg then 2.5 mg instead of the 80 I was started on). I forgot to renew the Prilosec prescription and figured that it probably wasn't necessary for the last two weeks. I'm regretting that decision now! I started feeling heartburn for the first time ever in my life at that time. It wasn't too bad, just a minor annoyance (especially when compared to all of the other side effects that I was suffering from) which I was happy to stick out for a week! My doctors assured me that the heartburn should go away once I stopped the Prednisone, but it never did. I've continued to have it off and on ever since, and it has been 13 months. My doctor didn't seem all that concerned when I brought it up in September, but on my followup visit 2 months later I'd dropped 12 pounds unintentionally because of a drastic decrease in appetite. She blamed the heartburn for this and gave me pantoprazole. She never mentioned GERD or Acid Reflux to me, but when I started reading up on this I'm starting to think that those last few weeks on Prednisone might have caused some serious damage to my esophagus or something, and that I might have this now. Does anyone else feel that they have GERD/Acid Reflux/Heartburn because of Prednisone? Thanks, -C.	prednisone cause gerd	hi i take prednisone autoimmune condition little year ago i pretty high dos stuff six week taper my doctor prescribed prilosec i take daily last week two treatment i taper i consider small dos 5 mg 2.5 mg instead 80 i start i forgot renew prilosec prescription figure probably n't necessary last two week i 'm regret decision i start feel heartburn first time ever life time it n't bad `` minor '' annoyance especially compare side effect i suffer i happy stick week my doctor assure heartburn go away i stop prednisone never i 've continued ever since 13 month my doctor n't seem concerned i brought september followup visit 2 month later i 'd drop 12 pound unintentionally drastic decrease appetite she blame heartburn give pantoprazole she never mention `` gerd '' `` acid reflux '' i start reading i 'm start think last week prednisone might cause serious damage esophagus something i might doe anyone else feel gerd/acid reflux/heartburn prednisone thanks -c	Prednisone_C0032952_prednisone-GERD_C0017168_gerd	Prednisone_C0032952_prednisone-Prilosec_C0700777_prilosec-Prilosec_C0700777_prilosec-heartburn_C0018834_heartburn-heartburn_C0018834_heartburn-Prednisone_C0032952_prednisone-decrease in appetite_C0232462_decrease in appetite-heartburn_C0018834_heartburn-pantoprazole_C0081876_pantoprazole-GERD_C0017168_gerd-Acid Reflux_C0017168_acid reflux-reading_C0034754_reading-Prednisone_C0032952_prednisone-esophagus_C0014876_esophagus-Prednisone_C0032952_prednisone	Acid Reflux	C0017168	'DefinitionDefinition\nGastroesophageal reflux disease ([[C0017168|GERD]]) is a chronic [[C0012242|digestive disease]] that occurs when stomach acid or, occasionally, [[C0005388|bile]] flows back ([[C0017168|refluxes]]) into your food pipe ([[C0014876|esophagus]]).

I got on it because of acid reflux, palpitations, and chest tightness after eating. It worked but I'm feeling better now and I am just terrified if I get off of it it will become worse.. Would it be fine if I quit cold turkey and took tums/Pepcid for the issues? Or would I have to gradually wean off of it?

51	low ferritin level not responding	For the past 11 years i have ben sufering from worsoning symptoms of anemia. It started as tiredness and over the years has gotten steadily worse. Now my symptoms are.... -severe fatigue -extreme breathlessness so severe that at times i pass out -bluish tinge to my lips -pallor -hair loss/thinning -angular chelitis on both sides of my mouth -extremely slow healing -irregular heartbeat -exhaustion -depression -cognitive impairment -pica It sounds like a normal case of anemia that has been untreated but im not anemic. The levels of iron in my blood and my red blood cells have been persistantly normal. My doctor has been taking blood every 2 months for the past few years trying to get to the bottom of this. She has ruled out..... -pernicious anemia -thyroid problems -various cancers -coeliac disease -haemochromatosis -internal bleeding -psychosomyic causes my blood test results are always the same..... I get normal results for- Hb (hemoglobin) RCC (red cell count) Hct (haematocrit) MCV (mean cell volume) MCHC (mean cell haemoglobin concentration) MCH (mean cell haemoglobin) RDW (Red blood cell distribution width) White cells/ lymphocytes normal Platelets normal B12 normal I am a healthy weight and have no other illnesses. The only test which comes back abnormal is my ferritin (iron stores) level. It is 4 and has been 4 in every test. It should be 12. I have tried various iron tablets but they made me sick. My doctor finally found one i could tolerate along withnan iron rich diet but after six months my ferritin was still 4. I have taken courses of iron injections and that has also failed to raise my ferritin. The doctor tried giving me higher doses and it didnt work. She theorised that the iron being injected was immediately taken up by my blood and not stored so i was taken into hospital and given iron overdoses and still no change. Basically i have a persistent iron store level of 4 despite all attempts at treatment. Even though my iron stores are low the iron in my blood is alwyas a healty level 13 but despite the fact that technically because of this i dont have anemia i have all the symptoms. None of my doctors know how to proceed. They tried a blood transfusion but since imnot actaully anemic it didnt make any diference. Im starting oxegen therapy soon due to passing out from breathlessness. I feel like im going to die if someone cant figure out whats going on.	low ferritin level respond	for past 11 year ben sufering worsoning symptom anemia it start tiredness year gotten steadily worse now symptom ... -severe fatigue -extreme breathlessness severe time pas -bluish tinge lip -pallor -hair loss/thinning -angular chelitis side mouth -extremely slow heal -irregular heartbeat -exhaustion -depression -cognitive impairment -pica it sound like normal case anemia untreated im anemic the level iron blood red blood cell persistantly normal my doctor take blood every 2 month past year try get bottom she rule ... .. -pernicious anemia -thyroid problem -various cancer -coeliac disease -haemochromatosis -internal bleeding -psychosomyic cause blood test result always ... .. i get normal result for- hb hemoglobin rcc red cell count hct haematocrit mcv mean cell volume mchc mean cell haemoglobin concentration mch mean cell haemoglobin rdw red blood cell distribution width white cells/ lymphocyte normal platelet normal b12 normal i healthy weight illness the test come back abnormal ferritin iron store level it 4 4 every test it 12 i try various iron tablet make sick my doctor finally found one could tolerate along withnan iron rich diet six month ferritin still 4 i take course iron injection also fail raise ferritin the doctor try give higher dos didnt work she theorise iron inject immediately take blood store take hospital give iron overdoses still change basically persistent iron store level 4 despite attempt treatment even though iron store low iron blood alwyas healty level 13 despite fact technically dont anemia symptom none doctor know proceed they try blood transfusion since imnot actaully anemic didnt make diference im start oxegen therapy soon due passing breathlessness i feel like im go die someone cant figure whats go	low ferritin level_C0580418_low ferritin level	anemia_C0002871_anemia-tiredness_C0015672_tiredness-fatigue extreme_C0015672_fatigue extreme-breathlessness_C0013404_breathlessness-lips_C0023759_lips-pallor_C0030232_pallor-hair_C0018494_hair-chelitis_C0007971_chelitis-mouth_C0226896_mouth-irregular heartbeat_C0237314_irregular heartbeat-exhaustion_C0392674_exhaustion-depression_C0011570_depression-cognitive impairment_C0338656_cognitive impairment-pica_C0031873_pica-anemia_C0002871_anemia-iron_C0302583_iron-red blood cells_C0014792_red blood cells-pernicious anemia_C0002892_pernicious anemia-thyroid problems_C0851024_thyroid problems-cancers_C0006826_cancers-coeliac disease_C0007570_coeliac disease-haemochromatosis_C0018995_haemochromatosis-internal bleeding_C1390214_internal bleeding-blood test results_C0849535_blood test results-hemoglobin_C0019046_hemoglobin-RCC_C0007134_rcc-red cell count_C0014772_red cell count-Hct_C0018935_hct-haematocrit_C0518014_haematocrit-MCV_C1948043_mcv-mean cell volume_C0524587_mean cell volume-MCHC_C0474535_mchc-mean cell haemoglobin concentration_C1277704_mean cell hemoglobin concentration-MCH_C2248810_mch-mean cell haemoglobin_C0369183_mch mean cell haemoglobin-RDW_C0427460_rdw-Red blood cell distribution width_C1304746_red blood cell distribution width-White cells_C0023508_white cells-lymphocytes_C0024264_lymphocytes-Platelets_C0005821_platelets-normal B12_C1968641_normal b12-ferritin_C0015879_ferritin-iron stores_C0450235_iron stores-iron_C0302583_iron-iron_C0302583_iron-ferritin_C0015879_ferritin-iron injections_C0850054_iron injections-ferritin_C0015879_ferritin-iron_C0302583_iron-iron_C0302583_iron-iron store_C0450235_iron store-iron stores_C0450235_iron stores-iron_C0302583_iron-anemia_C0002871_anemia-blood transfusion_C0005841_blood transfusion-breathlessness_C0013404_breathlessness	Anemia	C0002871	DefinitionDefinition\nAnemia is a condition in which you do n't have enough healthy [[C0014792|red blood cells]] to carry adequate [[C0030054|oxygen]] to your tissues. Having [[C0002871|anemia]] may make you feel exhausted.\nThere are many forms of [[C0002871|anemia]], each with its own cause. [[C0002871|Anemia]] can be temporary or long term, and it can range from mild to severe.\nSee your doctor if you suspect you have [[C0002871|anemia]], because [[C0002871|anemia]] can be a sign of [[C2020635|serious illnesses]]. Treatments for anemia range from taking supplements to undergoing [[C0199171|medical procedures]]. You may be able to prevent some types of [[C0002871|anemia]] by [[C0013470|eating]] a healthy, varied diet.SymptomsSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms vary depending on the cause of your [[C0002871|anemia]], but may include:\nFatigue\nPale [[C1123023|skin]]\nA fast or irregular heartbeat\nShortness of breath\nChest pain\nDizziness\nCognitive problems\nCold [[C0018563|hands]] and feet\nHeadache\nInitially, [[C0002871|anemia]] can be so mild it goes unnoticed. But signs and symptoms increase as anemia worsens.\nWhen to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you 're feeling fatigued for unexplained reasons. Some [[C0002871|anemias]], such as [[C0162316|iron deficiency anemia]], are common. [[C0015672|Fatigue]] has many causes besides [[C0002871|anemia]], so do n't assume that if you 're tired, you must be anemic.\nSome people learn that their [[C0019046|hemoglobin]] is low, which indicates [[C0002871|anemia]], when they go to donate blood. [[C0162119|Low hemoglobin]] may be a temporary problem remedied by [[C0013470|eating]] more [[C0453836|iron-rich foods]] or taking a multivitamin containing iron. However, it may also be a warning sign of [[C0019080|blood loss]] in your body that may be causing you to be deficient in [[C0302583|iron]]. If you 're told that you ca n't donate blood because of [[C0162119|low hemoglobin]], make an appointment with your doctor.	-Conditions and Diseases\n-Blood Disorders
52	Anemia and biliary discomfort	Hi All, I'll try and keep this concise! Two years ago I started feeling quite fatigued, with episodes of abdominal discomfort (right side, upper quadrant). In October 2010 I felt pretty dreadful (I'd lost weight) and ended up having all sorts of investigative treatment including ultrasound, CT scans, and endoscopy. All came back clear. In general, blood tests seemed to come back ok, with occasional mild elevations of bilirubin. Having improved slightly, over recent months I've started to feel awful again (brain fogs, fatigue, and intermittent abdominal pain). On occasions my urine has been fairly dark, and what appears to be transient very mild jaundice from time to time (skin only, not eyes). I saw the doctor two weeks ago, and during examination she lightly pressed my gallbladder which resulted in quite a sharp pain. Speaking over the phone the next day the results showed a slight anemia. All else seemingly fine, including liver tests, with the only figures I managed to jot down being 17 for ALT and 71 for ALP (even bilirubin was within normal range). This is good as when I bang my back (right side) I get a dull pain which resloves centrally at the front, and had worried that something was wrong with my liver. I'm now scheduled for another ultrasound on my gallbladder next week (although the discomfort isn't too noticeable at the moment). But, boy, do I feel rotten. I understand that some anemias can cause gallstones, but previous tests suggest I don't have any. Could it be that they can cause this kind of discomfort without actually creating a stone?

53	My Story And a Possible Solution to Itp	I had full-blown thrombocytopenia purpura for quite a while. My platelet count dropped to 4,000. They gave me prednisone for a long time and the count kept dropping after the the dosage was reduced. In early tests my spleen wasn't functioning abnormally and I did not have any form of cancer. My eukaryocytes were abundant. But somehow the count was still dropping. I took matters in my own hands and did a lot of research. Ascorbic acid (vitamin c) fights off infections. I took four ascorbic acid tablets per day. My platelet count lingered around 70k. Then slowly began to drop again. The vitamin c had some effect to say the least but did not stop the pestilence. Since that wasn't quite the answer, I did research on other vitamins. The potassium vitamin actually caught my attention first. It seems that potassium is an antagonist to rat poison. Rat poison makes the rats bleed internally. Potassium strengthens cells. After I started taking the potassium with ascorbic acid, my platelet count jumped to eighty thousand. Three months later, it was at 120,000. Now it has been three more months and I haven't experienced any negative affects. It seems the disease has lost its potency. I no longer have nose bleeds, fatigue, nor ruptures underneath my skin. I'm not saying this is the answer for everybody... But it seems to be working for me. Sadly the doctors laughed it off. It seems they are more afraid of losing money from the drug companies but i'd rather not conclude that. It is just a thought. And there is always the chance that there is another reason why it just got better on its own. This isn't likely considering nothing worked until I took these vitamins. I was just ecstatic when I started to get better. Overall, I recommend for any suffering individuals to try this treatment. This isn't for cancer patients, etc. Obviously. It may or may not work, but when I was sick I tried everything I could (that wasn't dangerous). Don't overdose on it either! I wonder if it has a chance of working on others. If anybody else tries this, please leave a response. Then maybe give me an update a month or two.

54	Is my anemia getting worse or is it something else?	I was diagnose with anemia a few months, I am 16. I have been taking iron tablets, but the other day i was in class and got really dizzy, i left the room and the teacher came out, tried to keep me talking and kept telling me to breathe. It's almost like my body wanted to pass out but i was fighting it, if that makes sense. I was shaking uncontrollably, and was starting to hyperventilate. I was finding it very hard to breathe, my face and arms went numb and i was struggling to talk. at that stage i was laying down with my feet up on a chair, the next thing i know there's 2 teachers running towards me, when they got to me they had their hands around my wrists trying to find my pulse, they struggled to find it. I couldn't keep my eyes open, and my face went as white as a ghost. I don't remember much of what happened, but what i do remember, it's not very clear in my mind. I'm really scared it'll happen again, do you think anemia is getting worse? Also is there anything i can do if that happens again?	is anemia get worse something else	i diagnose anemia month i 16 i take iron tablet day class get really dizzy left room teacher come try keep talk kept tell breathe it 's almost like body want pas fight make sense i shake uncontrollably start hyperventilate i find hard breathe face arm go numb struggle talk stage lay foot chair next thing know 's 2 teacher run towards get hand around wrist try find pulse struggle find i could n't keep eye open face go white ghost i n't remember much happen remember 's clear mind i 'm really scar 'll happen think anemia get worse also anything happens	anemia_C0002871_anemia	anemia_C0002871_anemia-iron_C0302583_iron-teacher_C0221457_teacher-sense_C0036658_sense-face_C0015450_face-arms_C0446516_arms-feet_C0016504_feet-chair_C1524106_chair-teachers_C0221457_teachers-running_C0035953_running-hands_C0018563_hands-wrists_C0043262_wrists-pulse_C0391850_pulse-eyes open_C0266574_eyes open-face_C0015450_face-ghost_C0014776_ghost-mind_C0229992_mind-anemia_C0002871_anemia	Anemia	C0002871	DefinitionDefinition\nAnemia is a condition in which you do n't have enough healthy [[C0014792|red blood cells]] to carry adequate [[C0030054|oxygen]] to your tissues.

And until a 7 weeks ago I had never heard of AIHA!!! I spent 9 days in the hospital and needless to say I was scared to death!!!!!! MY hemoglobin was at 4.4 when I got to the hospital, and I was in need of a transfusion but the anitbodies in my blood were'nt allowing me to get one, and I was started on Prednasone 100mg a day. The Dr's wanted to remove my spleen the 2nd day, but my concern was the I didnt have any blood and they could'nt give me any and what if I bleed during surgery. His answer was  we will just make sure that doesnt happen. That wasnt good enough for me, so I refused surgery. I KNEW that if I had surgery that day I was going to die. Well its 7 weeks later, and my immune system is still completely out of wack, my hemoglobin in back to 10, I still have a positive Coombs test, and now my platelets are getting high. My am on 60 mg of Prednasone. The Dr is again talking about removing my spleen. Does anyone have any information on experiecne with this and cane give me some advice? Im worried about my spleen being removed because I get sick quite a bit, I get broncitius a least twice a year. And I dont want to be on antibioitics all the time.

56	Type 1 diabetic - Stomach problems (Long burps)	I've been having really back stomach problems for several months now. The main problem is my burps get trapped in my stomach daily and it feels like I'm going to fall over. It takes time, but finally it starts... 10 to 20 second burps, it's not fun. Sometimes it'll last for up to 30 minutes. Also I've developed Acid Reflux... and it feels like a heart attack every time. My bowels are never consistent and had my gallbladder removed about 10 years ago. I've been type 1 diabetic for 24 years now and afraid it's only going to get worse. I've lost about 15 lbs. in the past month. I'm only 34 yrs. old. Also I started exercising everyday, but it seems like it's just triggering it. I cut out all soda and caffeine drinks. Some days the only thing I can eat is toast and crackers. I had to go to the E.R. a couple times, but they can't find anything wrong besides anxiety and reflux... something isn't right. I've had a stress test and gastric empty scan and passed both. I'm in the process of switching doctors because he won't listen to me... he thinks it's all anxiety related. I'm just wondering if anyone else has these problems and if so, what are you doing to help the symptoms? It's killing me... I take 80 mg of prilosec and half a bottle of gaviscon chews daily and a couple alka seltzer. That can't be healthy Any help would be appreciated.	type 1 diabetic stomach problem long burp	i 've really back stomach problem several month the main problem burp get trap stomach daily feel like i 'm go fall it take time finally start ... 10 20 second burp 's fun sometimes 'll last 30 minute also i 've developed acid reflux ... feel like heart attack every time my bowel never consistent gallbladder remove 10 year ago i 've type 1 diabetic 24 year afraid 's go get worse i 've lose 15 lb past month i 'm 34 yr old also i start exercise everyday seem like 's trigger i cut soda caffeine drink some day thing i eat toast cracker i go e.r couple time ca n't find anything wrong besides anxiety reflux ... something n't right i 've stress test gastric empty scan pass i 'm process switch doctor wo n't listen ... think 's anxiety related i 'm wonder anyone else problem help symptom it 's kill ... i take 80 mg prilosec half bottle gaviscon chew daily couple alka seltzer that ca n't healthy any help would appreciate	Stomach problems_C2186536_stomach problems-burps_C0014724_burps	stomach problems_C2186536_stomach problems-burps_C0014724_burps-stomach_C0038351_stomach-burps_C0014724_burps-Acid Reflux_C0017168_acid reflux-heart attack_C0027051_heart attack-bowels_C0021853_bowels-gallbladder_C0016976_gallbladder-yrs_C1710700_yrs-soda_C0683086_soda-caffeine_C0006644_caffeine-drinks_C0452428_drinks-crackers_C0452505_crackers-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-reflux_C0017168_reflux-stress test_C0015260_stress test-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-prilosec_C0700777_prilosec-gaviscon_C0061146_gaviscon-chews_C0699816_chews-alka seltzer_C0051166_alka seltzer	Diabetes	C0011849	DefinitionDefinition\nThe [[C0233324|term]] ``[[C0011849|diabetes mellitus]] '' refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses [[C0005802|blood glucose]], commonly called [[C0005802|blood sugar]]. [[C0017725|Glucose]] is vital to your health because it 's an important [[C0449417|source of energy]] for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues.

59	Diabetic Neuropathy; Celiac Disease	Hello All. I am new to this so please be gentle. I am 27 and I have type 1 Diabetes, for 20 years. Diagnosed with Celiac at 17 I have had pain for almost 5 years now and it is getting worse. I am unable to go a night without having my entire arms numb and tingly (so uncomfortable and odd feeling) and when I wake up I feel the most atrocious horrifying pain in my life! I just was seen by a new doctor, a pain management specialist, who was quite sharp with me by the way, but offered me some help once I told her I would rather get my prescriptions from my primary because he has been my dr for over a year now. She said she needed to see my chart and my tests that were done and go from there but the pain is getting worse and worse! I have a baby, he is 5 months old, and since he has been born the pain has been getting worse. I am assuming it is from the holding and feeding and putting to sleep of lil guy, and other things as well. I am also wondering if my celiac has anytihng to do with a nerve damage interaction. Probbly not but thought I'd ask anyways. I am on 60mg MSContin 3x a day every 8 hours; Norco 10/325 4x a day (but has been becoming more like 6x per day since the pain has been getting worse) I really need to get some insight on how this is affecting me in the long run. Will I lose all sensation in my arms and hands in a year from now?? What should I do in themorning when the pain is to the point where I want to just scream andcry!?

60	Type 1 diabetes Juicing and Raw foods experience	I really wanted to share this with people. I started a juice diet about 2 weeks ago, and I too am a type 1 diabetic. BACKGROUND STORY: I typically have a range of blood sugars ranging anywhere from 30 to the high 300's, with an average on my glucometer of around 170. And this is with close careful monitoring. I check my blood sugar usually 6 times a day and correct often. (being also a bit insulin resistant has made managing my type 1 even more challenging). I have never been overweight but recently put a few pounds on. I Leave for a bathing suit vacation in Costa Rica in 2 months, and was not feeling great about my body. I started a juice diet with the goal to look my best in a bathing suit by the time I leave for my trip. I didn't carefully consider the effects of diabetes (which is probably stupid). THE BEGINNING: I started during the 3 day Memorial Day weekend. I woke up that morning, went to the health store around the corner and had a few fresh squeezed veggie juices made. When I got home I announced to my boyfriend I am just juicing for the 3 day weekend. (Being an avid health and diet nut himself), He thought it was a great idea. He suggested I do it for a week. That sounded like a lot of pressure for someone who has never been a diet, so I insisted that this would be a 3 day venture. The first 3 days sucked. I was hungry and CRAVING solid foods. The 3rd day, at night I cracked and cheated with a handful of vanilla wafer cookies and peanut butter. When I woke up the next morning for work, I thought... What the hell, let's try this for another day or 2. There are juice places near my office! By the end of day 4, I had lost all my food cravings and had more energy than I can ever remember having. (I should also note that I unwillingly gave up coffee 3 months earlier because it was making me sick to my stomach). When I got home from work that day I had come to the conclusion that juicing was a very good thing, and that perhaps this should be a more long term process. If I feel this good, how could I stop?! I was allowing myself a nutrigrain bar or protien bar once a day. Usually I eat half of one just when I have a real hunger pange. It is enough to satisfy that. I save the other half for later or the next day. A week and a half later, I have a brand new top-rated juicer in my kitchen (thanks to my wonderful boyfriend). DIABETES: What about my diabetes? My range of numbers from 30 - 300's has shifted to be around 50 - 170. A MAJOR change. I am taking the same basal dose of my long acting Lantis insulin. BUT my low carb diet has reduced the amount of short acting novolog I take very siginificantly. I used to take between 15-25 units of short acting insulin every day, both for food consumption and correction factors. Since juicing, I take only around 3-5 units of short acting insulin a day. Not to mention I have to inject myself much less often. I should note that I am continuing to check my blood sugar 6-7 times a day to make sure that I am maintaining optimal health. This can not be a guessing game. I still get some low blood sugars. Especially over night, which was an issue even before I started juicing. I have found it helps quite a bit if (I check my sugar before bed, and assuming my blood sugar is at an ideal level...) I eat a protien bar or nutrigrain bar and DO NOT take insuliln to compensate for the food. When I wake up in the morning my blood sugars range from 75-110. This means that the carbs I took in may cause a slight sugar spike, but prevent the drop I was experiencing at night. By morning everything has leveled itself off perfectly. MODIFYING THE DIET TO WORK FOR ME: So my juice diet is slightly modified and imperfect, much like me. I am allowing for some foods, but sticking to mostly liquids. And ALL VEGGIES. Fruit would change things a lot, although occasionally I add small amounts of lemon for preservation. I am also, if I feel very hungry allowing myself to eat small amounts of raw veggies. But only raw, and only veggies. Carrots, cucumbers, radishes and spinach mainly. This means I am taking in only the foods I would take in while juicing, but allowing myself some of the fiber. It helps when I have the urge to eat. But I don't go crazy with it, I keep it to small enough amounts that I would not need insulin. Like a handful of baby carrots or half a cucumber. Also an occasional handful of almonds for protein. Concerned about taking in enough protein, I occasionally add protein powder to my juices, though I don't love the taste it gives them. So the protein bars once a day make me feel better about taking in what I need. TAKING A BREAK: I am now 2 weeks in, and have decided to take a break from the juicing for the weekend. Why? That euphoric energized state I felt the 1st week is gone. My energy levels are rather depleted, and I am finding that I am REALLY missing the way I felt last week. According to my boyfriend, my body has now used up all of it's stored glycogen, which provides the body with energy. From what I can read online, lots of juicers and raw-foodies take a break once every week or 2 to restore their glycogen levels. I did not know much about glycogen before all of this, so if you need more info try the wikipedia link: [en.wikipedia.org] I think it explains things pretty clearly. So with my much depleted energy levels, I have decided to take a break from the juicing for the weekend. I am being careful not to eat processed foods and not to binge or over eat. I am sticking with whole wheats and whole grains. Last night I had a small bowl of whole wheat pasta (mixed with some cooked carrots and raw bell pepper wedges, topped with a small amount of pesto sauce). I also have been snacking on a carrot and zuchini bread that I baked using the left over pulp from my juicer. I used whole wheat flour, honey, instead of sugar, and in smaller moderation than the recipe called for. I also added almonds for protein, of course. I am looking forward to start my juicing again on Monday. But it is nice to know that I can do this and take time off from it occasionally to still eat the foods I enjoy. Now those foods are treats that I look forward to, rather than the staple of my diet. THE RESULT: In 2 weeks I fit back into the majority of my pants. They are still a little snug, but 3 weeks ago I couldn't even get some of them all the way up around my butt. Now I can put them on AND zip them up. My diabetes is MUCh more well managed. Overall, I feel the best I have ever felt. For me, the key is not to put too much pressure on myself. If I am super rigid and strict, I simply won't do it. If I am easy on myself and allow a (small) cheat here and there, it relieves the pressure and makes it feel less like I am torturing myself and more like I am giving myself a gift. I understand that this method may not work for everyone, and some people need to be very rigid and strict because the little cheats can turn into more and lead to not doing the diet at all. But for me this works. My boyfriend says he sees a difference and that I look slimmer all around. But I am not where I want to be yet. I do not own a scale, and don't want to. In the past when I have had a scale in my apartment I obsess about it. I check my weight twice a day and it has become unhealthy, unproductive, and just stupid. Now, I choose to focus on how I look and feel, and not think too much about or obsess over a number. I am guessing that I have lost about 7 pounds in the past 2 weeks. For a 5' tall girl that is significant. But like I said, it is an estimate and I am aiming to lose more. Next time I am around a scale I can determine for sure. This has also been combined with adding more excercize into my life. As a New Yorker, I am naturally more active than people not living in a city, simply because I walk all over the place. I am now trying to have some form of excercize routine 4-5 days a week. One day it may be an active yoga, another day it may be a brisk 3 mile walk around central park. I have started doing squats and hip excercizes combined with P90x Ab Ripper X 15 minute ab routine (that one is a killer) to work on the parts of my body I'd like to see trimmer in a bathing suit. I want to note that the most important change I have experienced in the last 2 weeks is not weight loss. It is the easier management of my type 1 diabetes, and the overall way that I feel physically (including the increased energy). If I lose no weight at all and look exactly the same, this new lifestyle is worth it for these reasons. And I am so thrilled to say this, because it is not at all the reason I started this in the first place. But my results are much more and much better than what I would have hoped for.	type 1 diabetes juicing raw food experience	i really want share people i start juice diet 2 week ago i type 1 diabetic

61	Diabetic, Sprained Ankle Not Healing	Patient is 23 y/o female, 5'8, 190lbs, type I diabetic. Patient reports inversion injury to right ankle while wearing heels 4 weeks ago. Patient's ability to stand, bear weight, and other activities are unhindered but painful. Initial and followup examinations reveal no swelling, tenderness to palpation, bruising, negative DCAPBTLS. Patient complains of pain in exterior aspect of ankle on inversion and weight bearing, with no guarding, flinching or limping. Patient suspected of neuropathy related to diabetes due to erroneous pain when pressure is applied to any section of anterior thighs, knees, and lower legs and consistent high A1C results. Treatment thus far has consisted of NSAIDs, elevation, wrapping and ice with no relief reported. My only experience is as a combat medic and I have no real experience with diabetic patients. I am curious as to whether the pain experienced may be related to the injury event and possible manual nerve injury aggravating the possible neuropathy. Any other advice or suggestions to help relieve the patient's pain would be appreciated.

62	High level of blood sugar.	Hello this is my first post. So my father has a type 2 diabetes. He is 68 years old and thin. He has no other health problem except diabetes. Even though my father exercices everyday walking and riding bicycle his blood sugar stays at high levels. He does take medicine for the illness. Also his diet is pretty strict too, he doesnt eat any food that has sugar. Maybe only the bread might be the case but its black so i think there is no problem there either. Today he tested his Fasting blood sugar at the morning after being tired from exercicing and it was 190. After eating lunch it was 240. This has been happening for a long time so it is not the first time. Also my father might had diabetes for 20 years and more. But it has been only 6-7 years after he noticed it. So is this normal for a person that has diabetes or not? Maybe his body is used to that level of blood sugar?

63	Type 1 Diabetic with severe muscle spasms	I'm a type 1 Diabetic for 30 years. About a year ago I started having muscle twitching which escalated in to muscle spasms. They have become severe and very painful. I've tried Neurontin 1800mg per day which worked to lessen the spasms for awhile. When that stopped working they put me on Cymbalta 30mg twice a day which worked for about 3 weeks. Then they put me on 30mg Cymbalta and 300 Neurontin every 12 hours. This combination has now stopped working. PLEASE HELP ME!!! I am so frustrated and losing hope of finding relief. I am forced to take Ambien every night because I cannot sleep without it because of the pain. Please, anyone been through this? Any advise/suggestions?

64	Over weight diabetic husband with leg cramps	Hello - My husband is 6ft, 330 pounds. He has been diagnosed with diabetes now for almost 10 years. After not controlling his diabetes for several years he has been put on incillin. For the last 4 years he has been getting leg cramps. Sometimes in his calfs other times in his upper thigh. When I say leg cramps I mean severe, can't move can't breath, horrific cramps. Lately, it has been happening every night. I am so concerned that even at 43 this has something to do with his heart and he is on the verge of having a heart attack, but he is convinced it is a result of a back surgery he had 13 years ago. We have checked his blood sugar when the cramps take place and it is not low nor extremely high. We have also tried eating bananas, v-8, TONS of water and potassium pills. None which seem to help. Are these symptoms a sign of his heart struggling or is this symoptomatic of something else.

It 's your [[C0006104|brain]]'s main source of fuel.\nIf you have [[C0011849|diabetes]], no matter what type, it means you have too much [[C0017725|glucose]] in your blood, although the reasons may differ. Too much [[C0017725|glucose]] can lead to serious health problems.\nChronic diabetes conditions include [[C0011854|type 1 diabetes]] and [[C0011860|type 2 diabetes]]. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include [[C0362046|prediabetes]]-- when your [[C0392201|blood sugar levels]] are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as [[C0011849|diabetes]]-- and [[C0085207|gestational diabetes]], which occurs during [[C0032961|pregnancy]].SymptomsSymptoms\nDiabetes symptoms vary depending on how high your [[C0005802|blood sugar]] is elevated. Some people, especially those with [[C0362046|prediabetes]] or [[C0011860|type 2 diabetes]], may not experience symptoms initially. In [[C0011854|type 1 diabetes]], however, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 and [[C0011860|type 2 diabetes]] include:\nIncreased thirst\nFrequent urination\nExtreme hunger\nUnexplained weight loss\nPresence of [[C0022634|ketones]] in the [[C0042036|urine]] ([[C0022634|ketones]] are a byproduct of the breakdown of [[C0026845|muscle]] and [[C0424612|fat]] that happens when there 's not enough [[C0021641|insulin]])\n[[C0015672|Fatigue]]\nBlurred vision\nSlow-healing sores\nMild high blood pressure\nFrequent infections, such as [[C0017562|gum]] or [[C0037278|skin infections]] and [[C0750055|vaginal bladder]][[C0600041|bladder infections]]\nAlthough [[C0011854|type 1 diabetes]] can develop at any age, it typically appears during childhood or adolescence. [[C0011860|Type 2 diabetes]], the most common type, can develop at any age and is often preventable.\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf you suspect you or your [[C0008059|child]] may have [[C0011849|diabetes]]. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.\nIf you 've already been diagnosed with [[C0011849|diabetes]]. If you 've been diagnosed with [[C0011849|diabetes]], you 'll initially need close [[C0420318|medical follow-up]] until your [[C0392201|blood sugar levels]] stabilize.	-Conditions and Diseases\n-Diabetes
65	Crohn's Disease treatment options	Well, here is my story. In Sept. of 2004 I had my gallbladder removed. After that everything went downhill. My bowel movements were like pure bile The doctor said that was normal after gallbladder removal and things would get better. After 5 months of this and constant trips to the bathroom my doctor that removed my gallbladder referred me to a GI doc. Feb. 2005. She did a colonoscopy and said it was Crohn's disease. Said there was alot of inflammation and several ulcers at the terminal ileum. I started out on sulfasalazine and Took that for 6 months then started Pentasa. After a year on the meds I was doing much better, seemed to have things under control. Doctor told me she didn't think it was Crohn's disease after all because she thought the ulcers may have had to do with the anti-inflammitorys and antibiotics I was on for a sinus infection I was so relieved this was Feb. of 2006. I was finally off all the medications. Well, in March of 2007 the symptoms started coming back full force. I believed it was just stress and read alot about gallbladder removal, and thought this was all normal. Finally in August of 2007 being totally exhausted and wondering what this could be I went back to my GI doc. She did another colonoscopy and said it was definatly small bowell Crohn's disease I was floored. This couldn't be happening. She started me on sulfasalazine again and Entocort for three months. Then, onto pentasa again. After going off the entocort things started getting worse again. After 10 days of being off Entoctort she put me back on it for another two months. I have been off of that for three months now but still taking the pentasa, and many vitamins Folic acid iron twiceTwice-a-day a day, vit. D,Calcium Magnesium , mutivitamin, and omeprezole. She did another calprotectin test and sent it to the mayo clinic, it came back Back at 413 (o-50) being normal. Aug. of 2007 it was 455, then in Dec. down to 339, then in march 229. I was sure it would be closer to normal at least hoping I guess. Anyway, she wants to do another colonoscopy in two weeks and for sure start me on 6-mp or Imuran. Maybe humira or remicade. I am so terrified of going on any of these. All I read about is all the bad side effects and it scares me to death If anyone is on any of these please give me some advice. I have been reading on natural substances like barleygrass and that all sounds good but not sure if it would actually help seeing how bad this flare has gotten...Please help....	crohn 's disease treatment option	well story in sept. 2004 i gallbladder remove after everything go downhill my bowel movement like pure bile the doctor say normal gallbladder removal thing would get better after 5 month constant trip bathroom doctor remove gallbladder refer gi doc feb. 2005 she colonoscopy say crohn 's disease said alot inflammation several ulcer terminal ileum i start sulfasalazine took 6 month start pentasa after year med i much better seem thing control doctor told n't think crohn 's disease thought ulcer may anti-inflammitorys antibiotic i sinus infection i relieve feb. 2006 i finally medication well march 2007 symptom start come back full force i believe stress read alot gallbladder removal thought normal finally august 2007 totally exhaust wonder could i go back gi doc she another colonoscopy say definatly small bowell crohn 's disease i floor this could n't happen she start sulfasalazine entocort three month then onto pentasa after go entocort thing start get worse after 10 day entoctort put back another two month i three month still take pentasa many vitamin folic acid iron twicetwice-a-day day vit d calcium magnesium mutivitamin omeprezole she another calprotectin test sent mayo clinic come back back 413 o-50 normal aug. 2007 455 dec. 339 march 229 i sure would closer normal least hop i guess anyway want another colonoscopy two week sure start 6-mp imuran maybe humira remicade i terrify go all i read bad side effect scare death if anyone please give advice i reading natural substance like barleygrass sound good sure would actually help see bad flare gotten ... please help ...

[[C0021368|Inflammation]] caused by [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease can involve different areas of the [[C0017189|digestive tract]] in different people.\nThe [[C0021368|inflammation]] caused by [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease often spreads deep into the [[C0934502|layers]] of affected bowel tissue. Like [[C0009324|ulcerative colitis]], another common [[C0021390|IBD]], [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications.\nWhile there 's no known [[C1511495|cure]] for [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease, therapies can greatly reduce the signs and symptoms of [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease and even bring about long-term remission.

I have been hovering at around 120 pounds and no matter how hard I try, I cannot gain weight! My doctor now wants me to start on 6mp and from what I've read about it, I'm terrified! When my weight goes up, my other symptoms seem to fade. I do not want to risk cancer or some crazy, ridiculous side effect from some experimental medication.

68	Random Stomach Pain/cramps Throughout the Day	i have crohns disease. i was diagnosed about 5 months ago. did the steroid thing, and it got everything to normal, never had any flare ups or anything after the prednisone steroid treatment put it into remission or whatever its called. so everything has been fine and i have continued taking asacol daily. so everything was fine and normal and i was happy =) but the past few days i have been having random stomach pains/cramps throughout the day. it only lasts for 30 seconds to a minute. and i get it as often as every 5-10 minutes or every half hour or hour throughout the day. it started about 4-5 days ago. i once had food poisoning last summer, and the pain kind of feels like that, just not as intense (anyone that has had food poisoning knows how bad it hurts/feels) so this felt sort of like that, just not to the point where i had to lie in bed all die in extreme pain like food poisoning. im still able to go about doing daily things, and it hurts, just not as bad. so the only thing i can describe it as is similar to the pain i had when i had food poisoning but just not as bad as that. ive also noticed that my gas (farts) smell a LOT worse than normal. like a nasty rotten smell lol. which is fun when you have roommates and want to annoy them. anyway i was wondering what this pain i am having might be and if it is related to my crohns (hopefully it isnt). if anyone knows what this might sound like or knows anything at all please reply and help me out. if you need more info from me let me know. thanks everyone	random stomach pain/cramps throughout day	crohn disease diagnose 5 month ago steroid thing get everything normal never flare ups anything prednisone steroid treatment put remission whatever call everything fine continued take asacol daily everything fine normal happy past day random stomach pains/cramps throughout day last 30 second minute get often every 5-10 minute every half hour hour throughout day start 4-5 day ago food poison last summer pain kind feel like intense anyone food poison know bad hurts/feels felt sort like point lie bed die extreme pain like food poison im still able go daily thing hurt bad thing describe similar pain food poison bad ive also notice gas fart smell lot worse normal like nasty rotten smell lol fun roommate want annoy anyway wonder pain might related crohn hopefully isnt anyone know might sound like know anything please reply help need info let know thanks everyone	Stomach_C0038351_stomach	crohns disease_C0010346_crohns disease-steroid_C0038317_steroid-flare_C1517205_flare-prednisone_C0032952_prednisone-steroid treatment_C0149783_steroid treatment-stomach_C0038351_stomach-food poisoning_C0016479_food poisoning-summer_C0241301_summer-pain_C0030193_pain-food poisoning_C0016479_food poisoning-pain_C0030193_pain-food poisoning_C0016479_food poisoning-pain_C0030193_pain-food poisoning_C0016479_food poisoning-ive_C0175498_ive-gas_C0017110_gas-farts_C0016204_farts-smell_C0037361_smell-lol_C1416898_lol-pain_C0030193_pain	Crohn Disease	C0010346	DefinitionDefinition\n[[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease is an [[C0021390|inflammatory bowel disease]] ([[C0021390|IBD]]).

69	diarrhea and anxiety	Hi, i'm recovering from a surgery to remove appendix and part of my colon after some really scared and inflamed tissue related to a history of Crohn's Disease. I'm trying to get to eating solid foods after being out of surgery 1 1/2 weeks but a couple of times I've had what seems to be severe diarrhea and when that happens its accompanied with my whole body feeling hot and cold. I feel unsettled mentally and if I lay down it feels like a yo-yo back and forth from a hot flash to a cold flash and then back.. Also, i get a feeling of being disconnected mentally and i have anxiety and it almost feels like i'm close to having a panic attack. Its like I just cannot be mentally calm and my mind is racing and jumping all over. When the diarrhea is over i feel drained and I'm really tired. If I get sleep and relax its gone and i'm better and back to normal with not much anxiety. From that point i may be okay for a while but if I happen to have the bad diarrhea again i'll feel the same. What should I do about the diarrhea and what are everybody's opinions about the anxiety? Has anybody heard of this? Any suggestions on how I can eat to lessen the chance of diarrhea or anything else would be awesome... its seems like my anxiety and diarrhea are related.

70	Crohn's post-op	Hey About six months ago I had to have a bowel resection, as my disease went undiagnosed for a while. It ended up that I was very seriously ill. Part of my illness is that my bowel formed a fistula with my bladder. This infected my bladder, which in turn infected my right kidney and blocked it up (doctors told me that if it went on for much longer I could have had kidney failure). I have had a lot of treatment since then but have noticed a few things in the last month. I am not taking any anti-crohns disease medication yet, I am only on an Iron and multivitamin supplement at the moment. But I am having the following symptoms, please tell me if I have something to worry about, or if I am looking too deeply into these: - Every now and then, my left kidney is twitching (this isn't the one that was fully infected). It feels as if it is beating and pulsating. - Any time I check my heart rate (at rest) it seems to be quite high. It can be anywhere between 90 - 126 beats per minute. - Occasionally I am getting headaches. the front of my head hurts. - Diahorrea all the time (although I understand that there are things I shouldn't be eating now that I can't digest everything lol) - Breathlessness. This could be even from running up 2 flights of stairs at home, which I have never had any problem with. This breathlessness only lasts for about 10 seconds and then I'm fine. - My thumb keeps on doing this thing where if I try to hold it still, it moves and twitches itself, and no matter how hard I try to keep it still I can't. (this is probably completely unrelated) That's all. Please let me know if I'm just havering (as we say in Scotland) and I have nothing to worry about, or otherwise.

The most common areas affected by [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease are the last part of the [[C0021852|small intestine]] ([[C0020885|ileum]]) and the [[C0009368|colon]]. [[C0021368|Inflammation]] may be confined to the bowel wall, which can lead to [[C0008767|scarring]] (stenosis), or [[C0021368|inflammation]] may spread through the bowel wall ([[C0016169|fistula]]).\nSigns and symptoms of [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease can range from mild to severe and may develop gradually or come on suddenly, without warning. You may also have periods of time when you have no signs or symptoms (remission). When the disease is active, signs and symptoms may include:\n[[C0011991|Diarrhea]]. The [[C0021368|inflammation]] that occurs in [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease causes cells in the [[C1879646|affected areas]] of your [[C0021853|intestine]] to secrete large amounts of [[C0337055|water salt]]. Because the [[C0009368|colon]] ca n't completely absorb this [[C0546817|excess fluid]], you develop [[C0011991|diarrhea]]. Intensified intestinal cramping also can contribute to [[C0011991|loose stools]]. [[C0011991|Diarrhea]] is a common problem for people with [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s.\n[[C0000737|Abdominal pain]][[C0458254|pain cramping]]. [[C0021368|Inflammation]] and [[C0041582|ulceration]] may cause the walls of portions of your [[C0021853|bowel]] to swell and eventually thicken with [[C0241158|scar tissue]]. This affects the normal movement of contents through your [[C0017189|digestive tract]] and may lead to [[C0458254|pain cramping]]. Mild [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease usually causes slight to moderate intestinal [[C0231218|discomfort]], but in more-serious cases, the [[C0030193|pain]] may be severe and include [[C0027498|nausea vomiting]].\nBlood in your [[C0015733|stool]]. Food moving through your [[C0017189|digestive tract]] may cause inflamed tissue to bleed, or your [[C0021853|bowel]] may also bleed on its own. You might notice bright red blood in the toilet bowl or darker blood mixed with your [[C0015733|stool]]. You can also have bleeding you do n't see ([[C0028792|occult blood]]).\n[[C0041582|Ulcers]]. [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease can cause small [[C0234233|sores]] on the surface of the [[C0021853|intestine]] that eventually become large [[C0041582|ulcers]] that penetrate deep into-- and sometimes through-- the [[C1283694|intestinal walls]]. You may also have [[C0041582|ulcers]] in your [[C0226896|mouth]] similar to [[C0038363|canker sores]].\n[[C0232462|Reduced appetite]] and weight loss. [[C0000737|Abdominal pain]] and [[C0026821|cramping]] and the [[C0021368|inflammatory reaction]] in the wall of your [[C0021853|bowel]] can affect both your [[C0003618|appetite]] and your ability to digest and absorb food.\nOther signs and symptoms People with severe [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease may also experience:\nFever\nFatigue\nArthritis\nEye inflammation\nMouth sores\nSkin disorders\nInflammation of the [[C0545808|liver bile ducts]]\nDelayed growth or [[C0233896|sexual development]], in [[C0008059|children]]\nWhen to see a doctor See your doctor if you have persistent changes in your [[C0011135|bowel habits]] or if you have any of the signs and symptoms of [[C0010346|Crohn]]'s disease, such as:\nAbdominal pain\nBlood in your stool\nOngoing bouts of [[C0011991|diarrhea]] that do n't respond to over-the-counter (OTC) medications\n[[C1844662|Unexplained fever]] lasting more than a day or two	-Conditions and Diseases\n-Crohn Disease
71	Malignant Melanoma Questions...need Help!	Last week, my boyfriend was diagnosed with nodular melanoma, a form of malignant melanoma. The tumor has a diameter of 4mm but we do not yet know the thickness. The doctor said he was between a level ii and level iii and that he has a 70% cure rate if it was caught in the early stages. My boyfriend had a pet scan 2 days ago but the report has not yet been read. He is extremely anxious and depressed because of the waiting game. Please help me answer the following questions as his doctor seems to be little help. First, what timeframe can define early stages? 3 months? 6 months? 1 year? Second, how long does it typically take to spread to other organs? Please, any information or positive answers would help us both tremendously and help him at least get some sleep until we have conclusive answers.

72	melanoma on R. arm - Breslow depth 0.6mm, Clark's level 111	Hello all, I may add way too much information but since I don't really understand anything of what my doctor told me I don't know what to add and what not to. My main concern was that she told me she wasn't going to put me under anesthesia when she removed my melanoma...lol...she said it would leave a very large scar!! Who doesn't put someone asleep when they do surgery that leaves a very large scar?? Anyway, Yesterday my dermatologist informed me that the scrape biopsy she did on my upper right arm came back as the following: Skin: upper tight arm; invasive Malignant Melanoma, Nevoid Type, Breslow Depth 0.6mm, Clark's level 111 with Involved Peripheral Margins. Under Comment: Step level sections show epidermal consumption and a poorly circumscribed compound melanocytic proliferation. The dermal melanocytes demonstrate significant cytologic atypia and I see no maturation with increase in dermal depth. There are numerous mitotic figures. The findings are most consistent with an invasive malignant melanoma nevoid type. The Breslow depth is 0.6mm and the Clark's level is 111. A lymphocytic host response is present but not brisk. The mitotic rate is 4 per mm2. I see no lymphovascular invasion or ulceration. Hhhhuuuu??? Any help with just putting that into a few simple words. AND - why aren't they going to put me to sleep to remove this???	melanoma r. arm breslow depth 0.6mm clark 's level 111	hello i may add way much information since i n't really understand anything doctor told i n't know add my main concern told n't go put anesthesia remove melanoma ... lol ... say would leave large scar who n't put someone asleep surgery leaf large scar anyway yesterday dermatologist inform scrape biopsy upper right arm come back follow skin upper tight arm invasive malignant melanoma nevoid type breslow depth 0.6mm clark 's level 111 involve peripheral margin under comment step level section show epidermal consumption poorly circumscribed compound melanocytic proliferation the dermal melanocyte demonstrate significant cytologic atypia i see maturation increase dermal depth there numerous mitotic figure the finding consistent invasive malignant melanoma nevoid type the breslow depth 0.6mm clark 's level 111 a lymphocytic host response present brisk the mitotic rate 4 per mm2 i see lymphovascular invasion ulceration hhhhuuuu any help put simple word and n't go put sleep remove	melanoma_C0025202_melanoma-R. arm_C0230346_r arm-Breslow_C1511325_breslow-Clark 's level_C0449387_clark s level	anesthesia_C0002903_anesthesia-melanoma_C0025202_melanoma-lol_C1416898_lol-scar_C2004491_scar-surgery_C0543467_surgery-scar_C2004491_scar-dermatologist_C0259831_dermatologist-biopsy_C0005558_biopsy-right arm_C0230346_right arm-Skin_C1123023_skin-arm_C0446516_arm-Malignant Melanoma_C0025202_malignant melanoma-Breslow_C1511325_breslow-Clark 's level_C0449387_clark s level-Margins_C1269830_margins-melanocytes_C0025201_melanocytes-cytologic atypia_C0333865_cytologic atypia-maturation_C0678723_maturation-mitotic figures_C2698234_mitotic figures-malignant melanoma_C0025202_malignant melanoma-Breslow_C1511325_breslow-Clark 's level_C0449387_clark s level-host response_C0301872_host response-lymphovascular invasion_C1708790_lymphovascular invasion-ulceration_C0041582_ulceration-AND_C0002838_and	Skin Cancer	C0007114	DefinitionDefinition\nSkin cancer-- the [[C0262361|abnormal growth]] of [[C0814995|skin cells]]-- most often develops on [[C1123023|skin]] exposed to [[C0376223|the sun]].

Path report said 4.95mm no ulceration and mitotic rate was 3. We have many questions. Surgeon said all the have to do is sentinel node biopsy and a 4cm margin around where the biopsy was performed. What exactly is the recovery time for such a thing the nodes are in her jaw and neck for this. We also saw the oncologist yesterday and he said based on the path report she will need chemo for a year!!

74	squamous cell skin cancer	I am a 33 year old male and just recently noticed a brown spot about one inch below my waist. It has been there for ten years because I remember seeing it and I just thought that it was a mole. Last week I was paying attention to my pubic area because I had a seborrheic keratosis that was itching and noticed that this spot looked bigger than what it did ten years ago. The dermatologist biopsied it and it came back squamous cell. I do not know if he removed the mole by a shave or excision technique. Either way he removed the mole. He said my treatment was Aldara cream for twelve treatments and that I needed to come back in a month. I was confused so I called back and the nurse said that I caught it early and that the cream would suffice and that if it was invasive I would get complete excision or be referred to a specialist. My question is if this is an appropriate method for my diagnosis? If the cancer was deep enough then exicision would be more appropriate correct? Also, is the pubic area anything to be concerned with since it is an uncommon area for skin cancer? The only reason that I can think of it not being in a non-sun exposed area is genetics. Any input would be appreciated as this is worrying me to death and I am losing sleep.	squamous cell skin cancer	i 33 year old male recently notice brown spot one inch waist it ten year i remember see i thought mole last week i pay attention pubic area i seborrheic keratosis itch notice spot look bigger ten year ago the dermatologist biopsied come back squamous cell i know remove mole shave excision technique either way remove mole he say treatment aldara cream twelve treatment i need come back month i confuse i call back nurse say i caught early cream would suffice invasive i would get complete excision refer specialist my question appropriate method diagnosis if cancer deep enough exicision would appropriate correct also pubic area anything concerned since uncommon area skin cancer the reason i think non-sun expose area genetics any input would appreciate worry death i lose sleep	squamous cell skin cancer_C0553723_skin cancer squamous cell	waist_C0230097_waist-seeing_C0042789_seeing-mole_C0324740_mole-pubic area_C0230189_pubic area-seborrheic keratosis_C0022603_seborrheic keratosis-dermatologist_C0259831_dermatologist-squamous cell_C0221910_squamous cell-mole_C0324740_mole-mole_C0324740_mole-Aldara_C0718327_aldara-cream_C0700385_cream-cream_C0700385_cream-complete excision_C0015250_complete excision-specialist_C0087009_specialist-cancer_C0006826_cancer-pubic area_C0230189_pubic area-skin cancer_C0007114_skin cancer-genetics_C0017398_genetics-death_C0011065_death-sleep_C0037313_sleep	Skin Cancer	C0007114	DefinitionDefinition\nSkin cancer-- the [[C0262361|abnormal growth]] of [[C0814995|skin cells]]-- most often develops on [[C1123023|skin]] exposed to [[C0376223|the sun]].

77	Thin Melanomas Are Highly Survivable	Hello, I'm confused. Actually I am very confused. A family member was recently diagnosed with melanoma (mel). As he is family I decided to do some research on his tumor. It was too stressful for him to do the research himself. Here are the facts. His mel was thin about .4 mm, Clark level II. I read the path report and it had all of these terms I did not understand. A search on the internet basically said he had a 95% survival rate at 5 years and a 88% survival rate at 10 years. This I did not want to tell him so I did additional research. Some of older reports were very unfavorable stating that up to 18% of those diagnosed with thin melanoma eventually die from this disease much higher than the 5 to 10% mentioned elsewhere, however this report stated almost 10% already had metz before coming to this clinic so the actual number was closer to 8%. So I continued to do research on this hoping to find more reports close to his diagnosis report. I found a large study published in Germany with over 10,000 patients that dealt with thin mel. This report talked about these other terms that I had to research to understand. This report was very favorable as was another one recently published in 2008. What I concluded was per the German report is if you have this diagnosis with brisk TIL (strong immune response) that the death rate at ten years almost zero. Not 5 or 10% but very close to zero. However that is with brisk TILs and very low depth. Another report stated of 403 patients with mel less than .5mm that the death rate was also zero. I think 3 died but all three, when their path report/slides/sample was reviewed, indicated the depth was much much higher than .5mm. Though 13 patients did have a reoccurring mel these were all quickly removed with disease free follow-up. Reviewing the older reports as I mentioned were not so favorable though they did not generally include mitosis, vertical versus radical or horizontal growth phase and many had vascular or regression problems. What I have concluded is my family member should be ok however their is still one issue that is bothering him. When his derm doc took out the mel he did so with a shave biopsy not an excision or punch biopsy. The reason this bothers me is all the stuff I read said do not do a shave biopsy with suspected mel as it could mess up the path report and per others it could actually be dangerous and spread the mel. But his derm told him that was not true and that the path report stated they had taken all of the mel out except the border area was suspect. The derm doc said he got underneath the mel and told him not to worry. Later after a wide excision the follow up path report said the borders were all clean and no mel was found in the wide excision sample that was taken out. I told him what I found out except about the shave biopsy as I didn't want to worry him. He asked me about a node biopsy though his derm said this was not required for a .4 mm depth. I did some additional research and again I was confused with my conclusion. Ar German study reported 70 patients that did only an excision (mel was all between .75 and 1mm) and another 70 that did excision with a node biopsy (again all between .76 and 1mm). Years later, some 10 years later all 70 with the excision and node biopsy were alive and well, however 7 of the other group (10%) had passed away (consistent with the survival rate mentioned above). The sample was small but the results were kinda scary as most reports stated the node biopsy made no difference however some supported this study somewhat (not fully but disease free time was longer). This study again stated how important node biopsy was for patients with mel between .76 and 1mm however that is not how I look at it. If they find mel in only a small group of patients after doing the node biopsy they are potentially saving this persons life even if only a very small percent actually have mel at a micro level. Lets see I almost see a cost benefit analysis here. Are insurance company's worried about the cost of a node biopsy? Is it worth spending all of this money if we are only saving 5% of the patients who have this test performed as it is an very expensive test? Of course not, but it did make me wonder there for a second. Should he have a biopsy performed even after the excision? My conclusion is yes, take the test. Also please do not tell me Thin melanomas (mel) are highly survivable. This is a weak and pathetic response to a very dangerous and serious cancer. If you feel this way or post this comment you may as well jump off a bridge. Thin mels are not highly survivable. They are, in my opinion, completely 100% survivable. Breslow tumour thickness - less than 1 mm First get an SLN immediately. Tumor thickness is one of three key factors used to stage mel. Anything thicker than .75 mm is not good (actually anything past Clark level 1 is very dangerous - so we are talking all mels with a depth greater than your epidermis layer of skin (which ranges from .05 to 1.5mm throughout your body)) however it depends also on where the mel was located or if your a male or female - for some reason women do much better than males with mel - not sure why though some suggest they find the mel earlier and other say their immune system is much stronger than a man's. If on the head and scalp = bad, the back and torso = so-so and if on the arms and legs = much better from what I have read. Most common mel - Superficial spreading (SS) The four growth patterns of mel are SS, lentigo maligna (LMM), nodular and acral lentgiginous (ALN) mel. When grouped according tumor thickness SS and nodular had similar 10 year survival rates, whereas LMM had the best survival rates and ALN had the wost. The criteria for this classification is based on the growth pattern of the radial growth phase of mel. If it has a pagetoid pattern with solitary and nested mels scattered throughout the epidermis it is call SS. Or if it is single mels arrayed along the derm-epidermal junction it is either LMM or ALN. Nodular is defined as invasive mel without any notable radial growth. Mitoic count - bad news This is the number of microscope high power fields on which they can see the dividing of cancer cells. Zero is best and over 10 not so great, and in-between is so-so - however the data is still inconclusive for deeper mel - though higher is worse than lower; however where is the mel located? That can make a big difference. Regression - bad news You want no regression. As it means that they can't see signs that the tumor used to be bigger. Lymphocyte response - good news Host tumor immune interaction - the immune system isn't attacking the tumor (your body's immune system does not recognize this as cancer or it tried to kill the cancer at an earlier stage and failed as mel is too strong for the body to destroy for some reason) which tends to be bad news as you want brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, if possible. However if this is on your legs or arms than get an SLN and have the node removed if positive and if not than you may be ok. Remember SLN's are the first nodes in the regional nodal basin that cancer cells metastasize to from a primary site. If you wipe them out there first your chances are much better. Micro-satellites - bad news These are discrete nests of mel cells, greater than .05 mm in diameter and separated from the main body of the tumor. No signs of micro-satellites is good news which means no local spread. Vertical versus horizontal Melanomas have two growth phases, radial and vertical. During the radial growth phase, malignant cells grow in a radial fashion in the epidermis. With time, most melanomas progress to the vertical growth phase, in which the malignant cells invade the dermis and develop the ability to metastasize. Almost all mel past .76 is vertical from what I have read. It means it is growing down into the body (bad news) rather than spreading out and slowly sinking into your body (horizontal or radial stage), which is better. From what I have read you start with radial or horizontal and move to vertical. Mels that enter the dermis (the layer of skin past the epidermis) are called invasive however that alone does not mean you are headed to metastasis. Generally you need the mel to move to the vertical stage. That is, to be dangerous you must have either tumorigenicity and/or mitotic activity. It is a pointless path report criteria if your mel is deeper than .76mm and means nothing to you as far as diagnosis at this mel depth level. Going to vertical does not mean the cancer will spread only that it can spread and that is why SLN's are so important to stop the spread of mel. Margins Personally, if it was me? I would insist on at least a 1.5 cm margins for all thin melanomas. Ulceration, age, anatomic site of the primary tumor? This is important information. Ulceration is bad news, basically means the epidermis is tanked or destroyed by the mel. Also better to have mel on the arms and legs. Age? The older you are the worse the diagnosis generally. If your young it could also be bad as it means the immune system failed too quickly. Clark Level II You ask you doc, isn't all clark level II mel's vertical? Have they not broken through the basement of the epidermis/dermis membrane? Answer Yes they have broken through the epidermis and No they may not be vertical growing cells. If they are single cells floating below the epidermis border and they are the same size as the cells above the epidermis/dermis border (which is both good and bad) they are in the radial or horizontal stage. If they are larger than the cells above you are in the vertical growth stage and this is not good as they can metastasize. If they are the same size it is much more difficult for them to spread and metastasize, not impossible but more difficult. (I am not sure if I am explaining this correctly as my research defines horizontal or radial growth stage as cells no larger than nests of mel cells in the epidermis...either solitary or gathered in small clusters. These derm clusters of cells are smaller or the same size but not larger than any epidermal cluster of cells). However you prefer that they stay above the epidermis/dermis membrane (these are melanoma in situ - the cure rate is 99.99% at this level)). If they are below this level than they can travel to the nodes, however that is where you get rid of them if you can through a SLN biopsy and later surgery if necessary. Its obvious I'm not a doc however I have read a lot on this topic. I read a book called From melanocytes to Melanoma and many many artciles on this subject, but I am not a doc. So this is my opinion only remember I am trying to help and I can and probably will be wrong at times but I think SLN's are the way to go. I will continue to post and add advice and my thoughts. I hope this helps you in making informed decisions about your cancer.In summary, I think if its on the legs or arms and you have an SLN which is negative than your probably ok however if its on the back or neck or scalp or face than your playing with bad odds however I would still do a SLN and hope for the best. What will the doc say? Probably nothing. He will hand you the path report if you ask and not tell you anything of value. He will not tell you to get an SLN. Its too expensive and conflicts with his relationship with the insurance company's. From two periodicals: Surgery Pages 542-547 (October 2003) A total of 138 patients with melanoma were identified over an 8-year period (1994-2002) for SLN. Two patients with positive SLNs were identified (1.4%), one with melanoma less than 1mm thick. Patient charges for this SLNB procedure ranged from as low as $10,096 to as high as $15,223. This is compared to $1,000 to $1,740 for a wide excision. Extrapolating this date, the cost to identify a single positive SLN would be as high as $1,051,100. Assuming that all patients with a positive SLN would later die of melanoma if not treated, the cost per life saved would be $627,000 to $931,000. Conclusion: The cost of performing SLNB in this population is too great as only a small number will have disease identified that will alter treatment. This data call into question the appropriateness of SLNB for thin melanomas. My conclusion? I think if you read my responses you will get my conclusion which is have a SLN performed is at all possible. Is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Appropriate in Patients With Thin Melanomas: Too Early To Tell? No, it is too expensive and therefore will be pushed as not appropriate. International Journal of Cancer 121,689-693 (2007) The benefits of sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLNE) for those with thin melanoma. This study looked at 148 patients with mel. Half were provided with SLNs. To quote the study our data suggest that SLNE seems to nearly completely eliminate the risk of melanoma recurrences in patients with mel between .76 and 1mm thick (why not look at less than .76mm ?). I think before you throw out this additional option (which really is your only additional option with respect mel) your derm should explain this treatment option and why and how it is controversial. Note that 10% of the group that had an SLN performed had positive nodes and after removal of that node all were alive 10 years later compared to the other half where 5-10% died without this test being performed. In my opinion, it is not an option but proper treatment though expensive and therefore insurance company's and doctors will try to work together to minimize this cost if possible. Just because you have a 10 year survival rate of 90% does not mean you should continue with not providing SLNE's or 95% survival rate for that matter, though I do agree that metastases for thin mels are rare that still doesn't mean you exclude this treatment option. Learn about your cancer. Become an expert and do not trust anyone but yourself and your research. Please take care of your body and use your mind. Research, analyze, inform and pass the word. Do not let anyone tell you anything about this cancer without fully doing your homework yourself. Best, Mr. Very Confused.	thin melanoma are highly survivable	hello i 'm confuse actually i confuse a family member recently diagnose melanoma mel a family i decide research tumor it stressful research

78	Aldara For Actinic Keratoses	I recently had mohs procedure done to remove squamous cell carcinoma on my scalp. The scar has healed, and my dermatologist prescribed Aldara cream to be applied daily for about 3 weeks to a large area on my scalp where there are several actinic keratoses visible (she biopsied them). After 8 hours I wash it off. My concern is about the side effects I keep reading about Aldara. I've used it for 2 nights in a row now and am already feeling flu like symptoms and have noticed that my occipital lymph node is swollen and tender. Other than some slight itching, I'm not having much reaction at the site of application. Could the other symptoms be related to the Aldara or have I just been reading too much on the internet?	aldara for actinic keratoses	i recently mohs procedure do remove squamous cell carcinoma scalp the scar heal dermatologist prescribed aldara cream apply daily 3 week large area scalp several actinic keratoses visible biopsied after 8 hour i wash my concern side effect i keep reading aldara i 've use 2 night row already feel flu like symptom notice occipital lymph node swollen tender other slight itch i 'm much reaction site application could symptom related aldara i reading much internet	Aldara_C0718327_aldara-Actinic Keratoses_C0022602_actinic keratoses	squamous cell carcinoma_C0007137_squamous cell carcinoma-scalp_C0036270_scalp-scar_C2004491_scar-dermatologist_C0259831_dermatologist-Aldara_C0718327_aldara-cream_C0700385_cream-scalp_C0036270_scalp-actinic keratoses_C0022602_actinic keratoses-reading_C0034754_reading-Aldara_C0718327_aldara-flu like symptoms_C0392171_flu like symptoms-occipital lymph node_C0229711_occipital lymph node-itching_C0033774_itching-Aldara_C0718327_aldara	Skin Cancer	C0007114	DefinitionDefinition\nSkin cancer-- the [[C0262361|abnormal growth]] of [[C0814995|skin cells]]-- most often develops on [[C1123023|skin]] exposed to [[C0376223|the sun]].

79	MS & hysterectomy	I do not know if anyone can help / give advice regarding this but... In February 2017, I was diagnosed with MS. Fast forward to eleven weeks ago on February 14, 2018 (of all days)I had a complete hysterecetomy. This hysterectomy was sudden, as uterine cancer had been discovered. (My mother had died from uterine cancer.) Thankfully it was caught in the early stages, and requires no further treatment. My main issue with MS has always been leg weakness, more than anything else. The first 3 weeks after surgery I was feeling great and getting around reasonably well. The next day, (22nd day) I bottomed out with severe leg weakness, aka bedridden for almost a week and the weakness has been up, down, and all around since then. It's now 11 eleven weeks after the surgery. I read numerous other posts re hysterectomy experiences, but none seem to be like mine. Mine may be more profound / intense as I had a day surgery just 4 months earlier to remove a benign parotid tumor, that ironically was discovered the same time as my MS, in a MRI scan. So I basically had 2 surgeries within 4.5 months. I've contacted my MS Clinic, a few times, and they say I have to give it extra time, especially since its two surgeries in less than half a year. Not that the 2nd one was elective... cancer is cancer. They say I've basically been hit by a truck twice... give it more than the average time for recovery. Do not really have a choice. Has anyone else been through similar, or knows of anyone who has? Is there a 'light at the end of this tunnel' so to speak? Thanks for any input!	m hysterectomy	i know anyone help give advice regard ... in february 2017 i diagnose ms. fast forward eleven week ago february 14 2018 day i complete hysterecetomy this hysterectomy sudden uterine cancer discover my mother die uterine cancer thankfully caught early stage require treatment my main issue m always leg weakness anything else the first 3 week surgery i feel great get around reasonably well the next day 22nd day i bottom severe leg weakness aka bedridden almost week weakness around since it 's 11 eleven week surgery i read numerous post hysterectomy experience none seem like mine mine may profound intense i day surgery 4 month earlier remove benign parotid tumor ironically discover time m mri scan so i basically 2 surgery within 4.5 month i 've contact m clinic time say i give extra time especially since two surgery le half year not 2nd one elective ... cancer cancer they say i 've basically hit truck twice ... give average time recovery do really choice ha anyone else similar know anyone is 'light end tunnel speak thanks input	hysterectomy_C0020699_hysterectomy	hysterectomy_C0020699_hysterectomy-uterine cancer_C0153567_uterine cancer-uterine cancer_C0153567_uterine cancer-leg weakness_C0427068_leg weakness-3 weeks_C1442462_3 weeks-surgery_C0543467_surgery-leg weakness_C0427068_leg weakness-surgery_C0543467_surgery-hysterectomy_C0020699_hysterectomy-mine_C0338297_mine-Mine_C0338297_mine-benign parotid tumor_C0496857_benign parotid tumor-surgeries_C0543467_surgeries-surgeries_C0543467_surgeries-cancer_C0006826_cancer-cancer_C0006826_cancer-choice_C0008300_choice-light_C0023693_light	Multiple Sclerosis	C0002395	DefinitionDefinition\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially debilitating disease in which your body's [[C0020962|immune system]] eats away at the protective [[C0009653|sheath]] that covers your [[C0027740|nerves]]. This interferes with the communication between your [[C0006104|brain]] and the rest of your body. Ultimately, this may result in [[C0868945|deterioration]] of the [[C0027740|nerves]] themselves, a process that 's not reversible.\nSymptoms vary widely, depending on the amount of damage and which [[C0027740|nerves]] are affected. People with severe cases of [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]] may lose the ability to walk or speak. [[C0026769|Multiple sclerosis]] can be difficult to diagnose early in the course of the disease because symptoms often come and go-- sometimes disappearing for months.\nThere 's no [[C1511495|cure]] for [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]]. However treatments can help treat attacks, modify the course of the disease and treat symptoms.SymptomsSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms of [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]] vary widely, depending on the location of affected [[C0027749|nerve fibers]]. Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may include:\n[[C0028643|Numbness]] or weakness in one or more limbs, which typically occurs on one side of your body at a time or the bottom half of your body\nPartial or complete loss of [[C0042789|vision]], usually in one [[C0015392|eye]] at a time, often with [[C0030193|pain]] during [[C0015413|eye movement]] ([[C0029134|optic neuritis]])\n[[C0012569|Double vision]] or [[C0344232|blurring]] of vision\nTingling or [[C0030193|pain]] in parts of your body\nElectric-shock sensations that occur with certain head movements\nTremor, [[C0520966|lack of coordination]] or unsteady gait\nFatigue\nDizziness\nMost people with [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]], particularly in the beginning stages of the disease, experience relapses of symptoms, which are followed by [[C0025344|periods]] of complete or partial remission. Signs and symptoms of [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]] often are triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature.	-Conditions and Diseases\n-Multiple Sclerosis
80	Confused, newly diagnosed, need some help on what to do	I was recently diagnosed with MS. I've come to terms with the diagnosis, but I'm going for a 2nd opinion on Friday since the original Neurologist did not perform a lumbar puncture as he said it wasn't necessary and he was 99% positive MS was my diagnosis. MRI's have shown multiple lesions in the brain and 1 lesion in my cervical spine. Typical symptoms for me have been cold/tingling feet, calf twitching on both sides (primarily right) and tingling sensations in both hands. Lhermitte's sign is very present and quite frustrating. I read a lot about remission in terms of MS but I have been experiencing some sort of issue for about 4 months with maybe 1 or 2 days where I have felt normal. Not to get too personal but things with my wife and I have been troublesome over the last month and I have experienced 4 instances where my left arm gets a sudden rush of pins and needles, my fingers lock and I can barely move the limb...the tingles eventually spread up my left shoulder and then my right arm begins feeling the same sensations but to a slightly lesser degree, in each instance there has been an extremely stressful situation at home preceding the attack. My question is if this is actually a possible MS symptom or if I should go to the hospital to ensure I am not having mini strokes of some sort, my understanding is that TIA's typically attack only 1 side of the body. I have 1 uncle that died from stroke, aside from that there is no family history. I am 30 years old and these attacks scare me to no end. I would have gone to the hospital last night but my wife was out all night with friends from work and I couldn't leave the house with my 3 year old daughter there....couldn't dial a phone and could barely drive anyway, much less pick up my sleeping child and put her in the car. The attack lasted roughly 2 hours, the intensity started to fade after about 30 minutes. Any help or advice on this issue would be appreciated.

81	MS confirmed - now everything makes sense!	Hi first of all i wanted to introduce myself. I'm a 27 y/o female and received my MS diagnosis today. I have been reading the forum since I was told that I might have it. Strangely i feel relieved in a sense. Because now all my symptoms make sense. Since I was 14 I have had a few things that I felt was not right. And every time I saw my GP I was told its nothing and I'm attention seeking. From bad , really bad stomach pains ( IBS) to the cramps in my hands and the numbness being my imagination. Then there was the Vertigo (anemia, Although blood work didn't point that way) Restless and painful feet ( stress) Insomnia ( being a student) Fatigue ( being a student) feeling sick after 2 bites of food and yet feeling starving hungry ( being a student) Blurry vision to the point where I could not look people in the eye for the fear they can see my eyes are not focusing ( studying to hard) Stabbing pains all over , especially in my sides in between my ribs ( over exercising) Tightness in my arms, chest (weird just realized I forgot to mention that to the neurologist today) to the point where i cannot breathe. (sinus and working with Toner and chemicals at work) Hart palpitations (too much coffee, like 2 cups a day!!) So beginning of December and after being out of the country for 8 years, my GP decided he wanted to do a full battery of tests to see why i'm getting stomach cramps and why we cannot conceive. On the day I was admitted, my fingers started feeling numb and I had pins and needles in my fingers. Granted , it was happening for at least 3 days before, that day it was really bad. Do the point where my hands where locked into place with extreme and painful spasms that yet again I was told, was a sodium deficiency. They did blood work for,,, O just about everything, Rheumatism , Arthritis etc. I was stabbed so many times i can tell you exactly which vampire doesn't hurt you when they take blood. Once they established that I didn't have the usual stuff, they contemplated MS but pooh-poohed it in the end. I left the hospital with 2 certainties, Yet again I don't have the answers I was looking for and 2 i'm not ovulating and that I have IBS with a side of scars on my stomach lining that accounts for the Heartburn and stomach pains but not for the crawling sensation in my stomach OR the lack of appetite and nausea. Frustrated that I still don't have answers I decided to just let it be and continue with my symptomatic treatment I have been using. A week after I was discharged, the BEST ( WORST - KINDA) thing happened. I woke up with 80 % vision in my left eye. Thinking it was a migraine I bought my usual kits and slept it out for 2 days. 2 days later I had less that 50% vision in my left eye. The rest was just a gray brown blob. Not even when the optometrist shined that really bright light in my eye could I see it! He referred me straight to a Eye specialist who insisted I go for a brain MRI or as my sister called it a MR Brain. I had it the day after my 27 birthday, and when the report came back, it stated that Demyelating plaques are visible consistent with MS. Unfortunately, neither my Ophthalmist nor my GP was in office. I saw my GP about 3 weeks ago and he referred me to a brilliant Neurologist. Thank goodness for medical cover, He booked me in for a LP ( lumbar Punch) within a week, and I'll admit. Even though it hurt like hell and I had back pain and a splitting headache for 3 days after, it was worth it. Today i went to get the results. He told me we are half way with the diagnoses He has no Doubt that it is MS. I wrote him a nice long letter with everything I can remember that could possibly relate to MS. For the most he said that it is to make it easier for me to get around, secondary symptoms. The pain, the appetite etc, its all just secondary. The Optic Neuritis, is a Re-laps. And because it is the only Relapse that he treated, the medical fund would not pay out the medication until they are 100% on the diagnoses. Well, I don't mind waiting for the next re laps or the next MRI either way its only 3 months away, till i can go on meds. Till then i'll be doing my bit by changing my lifestyle and diet. He did say that he would talk to the diagnostic GP who treated me to find out weather the Hands spasming would be reconized as a true re laps. Either way we need to find the time element as we have the symptom . I Understood what he said but its hard to try and explain. It doesn't scare me, its just something that I have to learn to live with. Just like someone with Diabetes learns to live with it, so i have to do the same. One thing that gets on my wick is how people I speak to , Family Etc. try and blame it on my lifestyle, or on bad genes or tell me i'll end up disabled in 2 years and will have no life at all. Ignorant people irritate me and i'm quick to tell then to stop chasing up ghosts. I'm glad there is a place like this where questions can be asked and answers given. I will point more people here if they try and give out wrong MS info. And on a final note, just to prove that i'm glad I know what is wrong ( or right) with me now, I turned to the Neurologist today and said to him. '' you know what, I'm glad its not Lupus, cause its Never Lupus and he laughed!!! Thanks for reading. sorry its long winded but its good to finally get it of my chest. Imps	m confirm everything make sense	hi first want introduce i 'm 27 y/o female receive m diagnosis today i reading forum since i told i might strangely feel relieve sense because symptom make sense

82	MS and second condition involving the brain?	At 23 I went to the dr because I had been lactating for several years. I was also experiencing balance problems, not severe, but didn't mention that. I was sent for an MRI for the lactating as he suspected tumor on pituitary gland. A few days later I was told I had MS. The next day the neurologist sent me for lumbar puncture and I was officially diagnosed with MS. The lactating problem was forgotten by drs. since focus was on MS. it's been 4 years and I have been on copaxone, tysabri, IVIG, rebif, Gilenya, and had stem cell treatment in Costa Rica. Nothing has had any affect. I am now bedridden. I went from balance problems to tremors to the point I cannot use my hands to feed myself or do anything else, I cannot walk at all, I cannot sit up on my own, my vision is almost 100% gone, my speech and thinking ability are impaired, I have no bowel or bladder control. No meds help, no treatment helps and I've not been able to find one case of MS that has progressed this quickly. I am wondering if the initial problem, the lactating, could be a sign of a second problem such as a brain tumor or something else. The Neurologist focuses only on my MS symptoms and wants me to go on chemo for it. I feel that something else could be going on since this has progressed so fast. I also have pain in all my joints. I know I have MS, or the MRI's certainly show lesions but I've had no new lesions in 2 years yet the progression continues. I am desperate. My swallowing has been affected so I am only on Ensure Plus and still have choking incidences. I am so scared.	m second condition involve brain	at 23 i go dr i lactate several year i also experience balance problem severe n't mention i sent mri lactate suspect tumor pituitary gland a day later i told i m the next day neurologist sent lumbar puncture i officially diagnose m the lactate problem forgotten drs since focus ms.

83	Just got diagnosed with ms...what should i expect?	I am 5 months pregnant and have been told for the last five months that the numbness in my hands was pregnancy carpal tunnel. Finally 2 MRI's showed a lesion on my spine and several lesions in my brain. I have two young children and one on they way and am so scared and feeling guilty that I will not be able to care for them.

This interferes with the communication between your [[C0006104|brain]] and the rest of your body. Ultimately, this may result in [[C0868945|deterioration]] of the [[C0027740|nerves]] themselves, a process that 's not reversible.\nSymptoms vary widely, depending on the amount of damage and which [[C0027740|nerves]] are affected. People with severe cases of [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]] may lose the ability to walk or speak. [[C0026769|Multiple sclerosis]] can be difficult to diagnose early in the course of the disease because symptoms often come and go-- sometimes disappearing for months.\nThere 's no [[C1511495|cure]] for [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]]. However treatments can help treat attacks, modify the course of the disease and treat symptoms.SymptomsSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms of [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]] vary widely, depending on the location of affected [[C0027749|nerve fibers]]. Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may include:\n[[C0028643|Numbness]] or weakness in one or more limbs, which typically occurs on one side of your body at a time or the bottom half of your body\nPartial or complete loss of [[C0042789|vision]], usually in one [[C0015392|eye]] at a time, often with [[C0030193|pain]] during [[C0015413|eye movement]] ([[C0029134|optic neuritis]])\n[[C0012569|Double vision]] or [[C0344232|blurring]] of vision\nTingling or [[C0030193|pain]] in parts of your body\nElectric-shock sensations that occur with certain head movements\nTremor, [[C0520966|lack of coordination]] or unsteady gait\nFatigue\nDizziness\nMost people with [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]], particularly in the beginning stages of the disease, experience relapses of symptoms, which are followed by [[C0025344|periods]] of complete or partial remission. Signs and symptoms of [[C0026769|multiple sclerosis]] often are triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature.	-Conditions and Diseases\n-Multiple Sclerosis
84	Elderly With Dementia	Some people always ask the same questions repeatedly. They experience sudden mood swings frequently, and feel very agitated and anxious very easily. At times, they wander about aimlessly, yell, start crying, or display emotions of combativeness and aggression. Sleep disturbances, inappropriate sexual behaviour, hallucinations and delusions are a part of life for these folks too. These persons are afflicted with Dementia. How do you understand dementia?

86	Severely winded and short of breath	Tonight I've been experiencing a significant amount of shortness of breath. I do have asthma, allergies, and anxiety all which I know can be contributing factors. These shortness of breath episodes I experience have been going on for around 11 days and onset every evening around 6 P.M. or later. I've been light-headed tonight to the point of unsure if I can get enough air to keep myself from seeing purple colors and stars when going from sitting to standing. I don't feel this is orthostatic hypotension, but I feel it is progressively getting worse day by day with no change to blood pressure medicines. I'm struck by chest pains around the left ribs some nights while laying on my left side and it is enough to wake me up at times if I am drifting off to sleep. The windedness gets significantly worse even after doing activities as simple as walking to class and back which is in total less than a mile. I am only 22 years old, but am trying to get into pulmonology but am extremely crammed with time and classes. I have had times recently where I've experienced lots of dizziness even while resting and an increased heart rate of up to 94+ beats per minute with frequent episodes of ringing ears throughout the day while at rest. I don't know what is going on, but whatever it is is being exacerbated by any use of synthetic testosterone, zoloft, dexedrine, blood pressure medication, caffeinated beverages or exercise. All of these factors seem to greatly increase the difficulty in breathing and I am unable to convey the severity of my situation to many people I know. I have had 2 times standing up in the past 11 days where I lost my balance slightly but was able to regain balance before falling which is a new symptom that I don't usually get. However, these symptoms and issues don't occur to the fullest extent until in the evenings. I've additionally had random incidencies of extreme cold intolerance to the point my hands, feet, and nose have turned a slight dark blue color after use of dexedrine, caffeine sources, androgel, or zoloft. I am taking high doses of multivitamin supplements, have been also taking DHEA 10 mg capsules and Wellbutrin occasionally and with little consistency.	severely wind short breath	tonight i 've experience significant amount shortness breath i asthma allergy anxiety i know contribute factor these shortness breath episode i experience go around 11 day onset every even around 6 p.m. later i 've light-headed tonight point unsure i get enough air keep see purple color star go sit stand i n't feel orthostatic hypotension i feel progressively get worse day day change blood pressure medicine i 'm struck chest pain around left rib night lay left side enough wake time i drift sleep the windedness get significantly worse even activity simple walk class back total le mile i 22 year old try get pulmonology extremely crammed time class i time recently i 've experienced lot dizziness even rest increase heart rate 94+ beat per minute frequent episode ring ear throughout day rest i n't know go whatever exacerbate use synthetic testosterone zoloft dexedrine blood pressure medication caffeinated beverage exercise all factor seem greatly increase difficulty breathing i unable convey severity situation many people i know i 2 time stand past 11 day i lose balance slightly able regain balance fall new symptom i n't usually get however symptom issue n't occur fullest extent evening i 've additionally random incidencies extreme cold intolerance point hand foot nose turn slight dark blue color use dexedrine caffeine source androgel zoloft i take high dos multivitamin supplement also take dhea 10 mg capsule wellbutrin occasionally little consistency	short of breath_C0013404_short of breath	shortness of breath_C0013404_shortness of breath-asthma_C0004096_asthma-allergies_C0020517_allergies-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-seeing_C0042789_seeing-stars_C1825825_stars-sitting to standing_C0560801_sitting to standing-orthostatic hypotension_C0020651_orthostatic hypotension-blood pressure medicines_C0003364_blood pressure medicines-chest pains_C0008031_chest pains-ribs_C0035561_ribs-laying_C1622979_laying-walking_C0080331_walking-pulmonology_C0034060_pulmonology-lots_C0175218_lots-dizziness_C0012833_dizziness-increased heart rate_C0039231_increased heart rate-ears_C0013443_ears-testosterone_C0039601_testosterone-zoloft_C0284660_zoloft-dexedrine_C0591355_dexedrine-blood pressure_C0005823_blood pressure-caffeinated beverages_C0678438_caffeinated beverages-exercise_C0015259_exercise-breathing_C0004048_breathing-cold intolerance_C0009269_cold intolerance-hands_C0018563_hands-feet_C0016504_feet-nose_C0028429_nose-dexedrine_C0591355_dexedrine-caffeine_C0006644_caffeine-androgel_C0875960_androgel-zoloft_C0284660_zoloft-DHEA_C0011185_dhea-Wellbutrin_C0085934_wellbutrin	Asthma	C0004096	DefinitionDefinition\nAlzheimer's disease causes brain changes that gradually get worse.

87	Asthma Without Wheezing or coughing? (Page 1)	Hello all, Does anyone have daily asthma, but no wheezing or coughing? My only symptoms seems to be chest tightness/discomfort, shortness of breath. It scares me more because i think it's more than just asthma. I never cough and I might wheeze audibly once in a great while in the middle of the night. I have one or two asthma attacks in the past year that involved wheezing, but they were relieved after about 10 minutes with my rescue inhaler. The problem is I have to use my inhaler everyday - about 4 -6 times a day this time of year. Just because I am so short of breath and have tightness in my chest. My symptoms seem more scary as I always wonder if this could be cardio related. So far all test are a okay on the cardio end, but you just never know. I am only 32 and i was diagnosed with asthma about a year ago. It has sucked everyday because on top of that I have pretty moderate panic disorder and anxiety, so I cannot tell what hurts if it really even hurts. Anyone else have asthma like this. I am starting to wonder if there is not something else going on. P.S. I did smoke for about 12 years, but i have quit that a year ago too - then found out I had asthma that same week. Thought I was just having breathing problems because I quit, but I guess smoking was masking the real problem. Thanks for any advice...	asthma without wheeze cough page 1	hello doe anyone daily asthma wheeze cough my symptom seem chest tightness/discomfort shortness breath it scare think 's asthma i never cough i might wheeze audibly great middle night i one two asthma attack past year involve wheeze relieve 10 minute rescue inhaler the problem i use inhaler everyday 4 -6 time day time year just i short breath tightness chest my symptom seem scary i always wonder could cardio related so far test okay cardio end never know i 32 diagnose asthma year ago it suck everyday top i pretty moderate panic disorder anxiety i tell hurt really even hurt anyone else asthma like i start wonder something else go p.s i smoke 12 year quit year ago found i asthma week thought i breathing problem i quit i guess smoking mask real problem thanks advice ...

88	Persistent cough	I am curious if the cough I have had since December 2015 (that is when I first really became aware of it)is related to asthma or something else. Any suggestions will be appreciated. I had a couple of asthma attacks when I was a child, the first one at age 7, then an attack in my twenties when I was expecting my first baby. As I was constantly breathless I was put on a preventer - Seretide and I have been on it since then, I am now in my seventies. I walk often. I feel well though sometimes breathless climbing stairs or walking up hills. (I stop for rests then continue) so I asked my Dr. if I should stop taking the preventer. I was referred to a lung Dr. who did tests (I'm afraid I can't remember the name I think it started with Spir) after I went off the preventer several days before hand. He said the results mean I still have asthma (mild I assume). I was on Prednisolene for a 2 weeks and antibiotics before that) I also use Avamys nasal spray. He changed my preventer to Fluxotide, then to Symbicort over about 6 weeks, I am now on Flutiform but I am still coughing, sometimes a little phlegm comes up and I more than often have to clear my throat as it feels like something is there. I hope I have supplied enough information for someone to be able to offer a suggestion.	persistent cough	i curious cough i since december 2015 i first really become aware related asthma something else any suggestion appreciate i couple asthma attack i child first one age 7 attack twenty i expect first baby a i constantly breathless i put preventer seretide i since i seventy i walk often i feel well though sometimes breathless climb stair walk hill i stop rest continue i ask dr. i stop take preventer i refer lung dr. test i 'm afraid i ca n't remember name i think start spir i go preventer several day hand he say result mean i still asthma mild i assume i prednisolene 2 week antibiotic i also use avamys nasal spray he change preventer fluxotide symbicort 6 week i flutiform i still cough sometimes little phlegm come i often clear throat feel like something i hope i supply enough information someone able offer suggestion	Persistent cough_C0562483_persistent cough	cough_C0010200_cough-asthma_C0004096_asthma-asthma attacks_C0347950_asthma attacks-child_C0008059_child-attack_C1261512_attack-twenties_C0724000_twenties-baby_C0021270_baby-Seretide_C1130494_seretide-climbing stairs_C1290942_climbing stairs-walking up hills_C0580812_walking up hills-lung_C0024109_lung-hand_C0018563_hand-asthma_C0004096_asthma-antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics-nasal spray_C2825048_nasal spray-Symbicort_C1121854_symbicort-phlegm_C0225378_phlegm-throat_C0031354_throat	Asthma	C0004096	DefinitionDefinition\nAlzheimer's disease causes brain changes that gradually get worse.

89	Need some advice on breathing problems	Hello everyone, My name is Chris. I just want to start by saying sorry if this post is long, but I want to make sure to be as detailed as possible. I grew up with asthma since I was a baby but had it under control most of my life. I'm currently 30 now and for the last 5 years my health has been very bad and I'm trying to find answers. Any kind of help will be appreciated. I was diagnosed with breathing problems and asthma when I was 3. I was sent to the ER a number of times in the late 80s before the doctors had me purchase a nebulizer machine and got a rescue inhaler. I had the classic signs of asthma, wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing in colder weather. After using medication though I would feel brand new and it would work well. One thing I want to mention and I'm not sure if this will be helpful, is even when I was diagnosed with this at a very young age, I would always, always get good numbers on my peak flow, and would be in green. This would give me a lot of trouble later on by other doctors or professionals thinking I didn't have any asthma related problems because I would do well with it. I never had much of a problem dealing with my health from then on until my mid 20's. Fast forward to about 5 years ago, and something started happening that I'm still searching for the answer. It's difficult for me to explain but I will try my best with what happens on a regular basis: When I wake up in the morning, my breathing is very shallow. If I try to breath in fully, my lungs will stop me. when I breath out completely, I will have faint wheezing. Using my albuterol inhaler opens up the airway slightly so I can breathe in completely but it doesn't' stop this feeling from going away. I will then cough up yellow mucus through out the morning, and tend to clear my throat a lot. Other symptoms are: coughing more, nose being stuffy, sneezing. All of this would still be tolerable to me if it wasn't for the worse thing, which is my lungs. When I try to do any physical activity (I have tested this) whether it's doing moderate exercise or just doing 1 set of push ups (so anything that seems to make my lungs work a little bit) my breathing gets significantly worse after about half an hour after I have exerted myself. I will have this incredible fatigue that continues to get worse every hour and will last for about a full day, and my breathing really hurts. I have tried using my inhaler before or after exercise, warming up properly, using a mask indoors to exercise, none of it helps. This will happen to me every single time I do it, no matter what physical activity it is as long as I use my lungs a little bit more than just walking around. I have been to two different regular physicians and two other pulmonologist during the last 5 years, and nobody can figure out why this is happening to me. Another thing I want to make a point of that is important, is during this 5 year period there are bouts of about 1 to 3 months where my breathing actually goes back to normal, and I can exercise with little to no effort, and I'm not on any medication. I have tried writing all of the times down this happens, but there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern if it's based on allergies or weather, time of year, etc. It just seems random. I also have acid reflux since I was in my early 20's, but I do eat properly and I never change my diet when my health is either fine or doing bad. Some of the medications I have tried are: Singulair, Advair, Flovent, Spiriva, over the counter allergy meds, and Omeperazole for the acid reflux. I have had the methacholine challenge done and the results say I don't have asthma anymore. It is strange because the feeling I get from difficulty breathing doesn't feel like the classic signs I had as a child. This year I was fine from January through March until I got the flu from work, and then afterwards it hasn't gone back to normal again. Here are some bullet points for reference: - My symptoms stay for months but have gone away a few times a year - breathing is aggravated more so by any physical activity that requires my lungs to work, something I never had a problem with in my early adulthood. fatigue will set in for a full day afterwards - I have had allergy testing done and I know I am allergic to only cats and dogs, but I don't own either and my house is very clean. - I grew up with asthma and medication did help me, but this current feeling of when I'm sick all the time doesn't feel like classic asthma anymore, and albuterol rarely helps. - My current doctor believes it could be a sign of allergies still or GERD, but has no explanation of why its fine a few times a year for a month or so, when I never changed my surroundings or eating habits. - I don't drink or smoke Thank you again everyone for any help that I can get, it means a lot to me. It has affected my quality of life to the point where I'm very depressed these days because I can't get an answer, and when I do feel better for a few months it is so hard to go back to this pattern where I can't exercise anymore and feel terrible. I have tried researching all of this myself online and in books but the main thing I cannot find anywhere is the feeling of my lungs being so fatigued and painful hours and hours after exercise, most reports or articles I've come across say asthmatics are fine after they've taken medication before or after.	need advice breathing problem	hello everyone my name chris i want start say sorry post long

90	new here, confused allergies and/or asthma?	Hi 30, smoked at least 10 years, with periods of on and off.... live in a VERY polluted city in latin America. 5 years. quit cigs in jan, smoked weed and then when started getting a tight chest the following day and/ or slight diff breathing in smoky environments quit and removed situations from life started wih increasing tight chest after exposure to smoke... this developed to include some slight mucus prod. went to the beach for 2 weeks and all symtoms pretty much went away, got bak to city and had some near immediate clues that my lungs weren't happy, slight small little pains or temp tightness.... saw an ENT and he said respiratory allergies without being specific and gave me a steroid inhaler and some asthma tabs. took those for a few days after a partic bad tightness episode, I went to see a pulmonologist and he checked me out and said I might have early COPD though without doing a PFT.... put me on celestone, took me off ENT's drugs, a powerful gargling mouth wash as I had a super sore throat esp on one side, an expectorant and antibiotics just in case. the expectorant cleared lungs in about 2 days but inflamed throat like crazy... left city again and some improvement in symptoms tho went to NY and Phila so although like mountain air compared to home I was still sensitive to irritants.. perfume I noted started getting me bad, tightness for an hour or two after slightly prolonged exposure. since back I'm now on Zenhale 200/5 2x2 day which I feel helps a bit but it's not a super help. some wheezing, maybe 2 or 3 times. mucus is a minor issue now, very minor. cough, none to speak of apart from once or twice every couple of days.... chest tightness for an hour or two following perfume is most noticeable thing.... no idea qwith smoke as I run a mile if someones smoking.... day I got back from NY phila trip woke up with some SOB and was a bit panicky, took inhaler and celestone and within an hour or so I was ok.... COPD forums have told me generally that allergies and/or asthma sounds most likely?? and told me to go away in nice terms... what do you think? any and all comments appreciated.	new confuse allergy and/or asthma	hi 30 smoke least 10 year period ... live very pollute city latin america 5 year quit cigs jan smoke weed start get tight chest follow day and/ slight diff breathing smoky environment quit remove situation life start wih increase tight chest exposure smoke ... developed include slight mucus prod go beach 2 week symtoms pretty much go away get bak city near immediate clue lung n't happy slight small little pain temp tightness ... saw ent say respiratory allergy without specific give steroid inhaler asthma tab take day partic bad tightness episode i go see pulmonologist checked say i might early copd though without pft ... put celestone take ent 's drug powerful gargle mouth wash i super sore throat esp one side expectorant antibiotic case expectorant clear lung 2 day inflame throat like crazy ... left city improvement symptom tho go ny phila although like mountain air compare home i still sensitive irritants.. perfume i note start get bad tightness hour two slightly prolong exposure since back i 'm zenhale 200/5 2x2 day i feel help bit 's super help wheeze maybe 2 3 time mucus minor issue minor cough none speak apart twice every couple day ... chest tightness hour two follow perfume noticeable thing ... idea qwith smoke i run mile someone smoking ... day i get back ny phila trip woke sob bit panicky take inhaler celestone within hour i ok ... copd forum told generally allergy and/or asthma sound likely told go away nice term ... think comment appreciate	allergies_C0020517_allergies-asthma_C0004096_asthma	periods_C0025344_periods-city_C0008848_city-latin America_C0023122_latin america-weed_C0024809_weed-tight chest_C0232292_tight chest-breathing in_C0004048_breathing in-tight chest_C0232292_tight chest-mucus_C0026727_mucus-prod_C0070319_prod-beach_C0331781_beach-bak_C1706876_bak-city_C0008848_city-lungs_C0024109_lungs-pains_C0030193_pains-ENT_C0262471_ent-steroid_C0038317_steroid-inhaler_C0021461_inhaler-asthma_C0004096_asthma-pulmonologist_C0586859_pulmonologist-COPD_C0024117_copd-PFT_C0024119_pft-celestone_C0701247_celestone-ENT_C0262471_ent-gargling_C0232464_gargling-mouth wash_C0026647_mouth wash-sore throat_C0242429_sore throat-esp_C0015373_esp-expectorant_C0728707_expectorant-antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics-expectorant_C0728707_expectorant-lungs_C0024109_lungs-inflamed throat_C0031350_inflamed throat-city_C0008848_city-tho_C0449208_tho-Phila_C0031525_phila-mountain_C0442533_mountain-irritants_C0022108_irritants-wheezing_C0043144_wheezing-mucus_C0026727_mucus-cough_C0010200_cough-chest tightness_C0232292_chest tightness-smoke_C0037366_smoke-smoking_C0037369_smoking-phila_C0031525_phila-trip_C0077275_trip-SOB_C0013404_sob-inhaler_C0021461_inhaler-celestone_C0701247_celestone-COPD_C0024117_copd-allergies_C0020517_allergies-asthma_C0004096_asthma-terms_C0233324_terms	Asthma	C0004096	DefinitionDefinition\nAlzheimer's disease causes brain changes that gradually get worse.

91	Chest tightness and shortness of breath with normal xray and CT	I started having chest tightness and shortness of breath about four months ago, which started off as being intermittent and gradually got to the stage where it was constant. Around the same time, there was about a 1/2 week smog episode in London (where I live). I happened to have a check-up scheduled at my local medical centre, during which the asthma nurse said my peak flow was a bit low (I'm 31 yrs old and hit 550), so she told me to take a blue salbutamol inhaler. I did this only sporadically to begin with, but then found I was using it 4/5 times a day, sometimes without any relief. I went back to the doctor who recommended that I see a cardiologist. He gave me an MRI scan of the heart, which came back normal, after which I was referred to a respiratory specialist. He put me on symbicort for a couple of weeks, which elevated my peak flow readings to 620/630, but I was still getting shortness of breath and chest tightness, including in the middle of the night. He ordered blood tests (which came back with a dust mite allergy and a slight deficiency in iron - although this was within normal limits) and also ordered a chest xray and lung ct scan (with contrast, in case there was a blood clot). Both came back normal. He believes that the problem is anxiety related and referred me to a psychiatrist, who I am due to meet next week, and he has mentioned the possibility of some CBT. Also a couple of weeks ago I developed constant daily headaches that did not seem to clear with over the counter painkillers. Again went to the doctor, who referred me to a neurologist, who gave me a brain MRI. Again, came back normal, except for some sign of congestion in my sinuses (likely because of a cold I developed about a month ago). That cold has still left me with a sense of taste and smell that is not completely back to normal. I don't know whether it is related but I also have a clicky jaw, which the doctor has told me is temporomandibular joint disorder. It doesn't hurt, but my jaw does click constantly when I eat. Although the chest tightness and shortness of breath have settled since the CT scan result, they have not completely disappeared. I have been sleeping better, although yesterday I had quite bad shortness of breath in the evening and woke up two or three times at night short of breath. I'm really not convinced that anxiety is the problem here, do you think I should go back to the respiratory specialist? Are there any more tests that he can perform?	chest tightness shortness breath normal xray ct	i start chest tightness shortness breath four month ago start intermittent gradually get stage constant around time 1/2 week smog episode london i live i happen check-up schedule local medical centre asthma nurse say peak flow bit low i 'm 31 yr old hit 550 told take blue salbutamol inhaler i sporadically begin found i use 4/5 time day sometimes without relief i go back doctor recommend i see cardiologist he give mri scan heart come back normal i refer respiratory specialist he put symbicort couple week elevate peak flow reading 620/630 i still get shortness breath chest tightness include middle night he order blood test come back dust mite allergy slight deficiency iron although within normal limit also order chest xray lung ct scan contrast case blood clot both come back normal he believe problem anxiety related refer psychiatrist i due meet next week mention possibility cbt also couple week ago i developed constant daily headache seem clear counter painkiller again go doctor refer neurologist give brain mri again come back normal except sign congestion sinus likely cold i developed month ago that cold still left sense taste smell completely back normal i n't know whether related i also `` clicky '' jaw doctor told temporomandibular joint disorder it n't hurt jaw click constantly i eat although chest tightness shortness breath settle since ct scan result completely disappear i sleep better although yesterday i quite bad shortness breath even woke two three time night short breath i 'm really convince anxiety problem think i go back respiratory specialist are test perform	Chest tightness_C0232292_chest tightness-shortness of breath_C0013404_shortness of breath-normal xray_C0853573_normal x ray	chest tightness_C0232292_chest tightness-shortness of breath_C0013404_shortness of breath-smog_C0037365_smog-London_C0023973_london-asthma_C0004096_asthma-peak flow_C0857465_peak flow-yrs_C1710700_yrs-salbutamol_C0001927_salbutamol-inhaler_C0021461_inhaler-cardiologist_C0175906_cardiologist-heart_C0018787_heart-specialist_C0087009_specialist-symbicort_C1121854_symbicort-peak flow_C0857465_peak flow-readings_C0034754_readings-shortness of breath_C0013404_shortness of breath-chest tightness_C0232292_chest tightness-blood tests_C0018941_blood tests-dust mite_C0998367_dust mite-iron_C0302583_iron-chest xray_C0039985_chest x ray-lung_C0024109_lung-ct scan_C0040405_ct scan-blood clot_C0302148_blood clot-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-psychiatrist_C0033872_psychiatrist-CBT_C0009244_cbt-daily headaches_C3661947_daily headaches-counter_C0702263_counter-painkillers_C0002771_painkillers-neurologist_C0237426_neurologist-brain MRI_C0412675_brain mri-congestion_C0700148_congestion-sinuses_C0030471_sinuses-cold_C0009443_cold-sense of taste_C0039336_sense of taste-smell_C0037361_smell-jaw_C0022359_jaw-temporomandibular joint disorder_C0039494_temporomandibular joint disorder-jaw_C0022359_jaw-chest tightness_C0232292_chest tightness-shortness of breath_C0013404_shortness of breath-CT scan_C0040405_ct scan-shortness of breath_C0013404_shortness of breath-short of breath_C0013404_short of breath-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-specialist_C0087009_specialist	Asthma	C0004096	DefinitionDefinition\nAlzheimer's disease causes brain changes that gradually get worse.

92	Child with asthma sick for weeks at a time	Hello, I am looking for input/experiences from other parents of children with the same type of things going on. My youngest daughter who just turned 3 has just recently had dr say she believes she has asthma as she has had a nighttime cough since she was little and it has now progressed to her always being sick with a cough, wheezing , you can hear the cackling in her chest when she breathes and exhales loudly at end of each breath when it's really bad . However we have some over and over the albuteral treatments with nebulizer machine and we do a round of liquid steroids every time and usually it gets better after couple weeks but few days later it starts again . She has now basically been sick for like 4 months at her last appt for this episode they again said start albuteral , take Zyrtec at night, round of steroids and also started her Week ago on a daily dose of singular .. This is being none of this has given her much relief and I am worried it's not even asthma at this point and maybe something more serious ?? I don't know , she has appt with a pulmonologist / allergist on June 18th but I am getting so frustrated and worried we are giving her these meds for no reason since they don't totally fix anything and she hardly gets a break .. If anyone has similar experiences etc please share with me if this is normal and she just had a bad case of asthma but I just feel like something isn't right not sure if meds are wrong or a whole other issue going on. Also she just recently had full blood work and blood allergy testing done and that all came back clear ..

93	Joint Pain, swollen and redness of joints	Since 17 years old the cartialidge around my rib cage has been on and off inflamed. At 22 this problem spread all over my body, including fatigue. My doctor was certain it was RA. Now 23, this sickness continues to get worse making life almost impossible to live and some days I have to be in bed most of the day because of some activity I did prior. I am on an NSAID, which has stopped helping me as much as it once did. I cannot do any activity with out feeling Pain, being swollen, and feeling tired! I was shocked when my blood results came back and my sed rate was normal. This left me feeling very confused. I can see the redness, see my joints swollen, and I can feel the pain. It is in my hands, wrists, knees, ankles, rib cage, spine and hips. This pain is something I feel every single day, and usually about 4 joints a day will hurt but they are somewhere different with each day. Also, with this usually when I feel fatigue, my eyes get hot and sometimes burn, my doctor couldn't help me with that one. I am wondering if somehow my immune system is invloved when I feel that way, when fatigued, I am often imobalized.

96	Pain in knees and I get swelling above my knees	Hi, looking for any advice if possible. I get swelling above my knees sometimes when my knees hurt but usually about an hour after I've been exercising. I also get a lot of sharp pains in both my knees shooting downwards in the morning and evening. There is not extreme swelling but there is plenty of liquid there. My knees stay slightly purple most of the time and my joints go stiff when sitting. I have actually been to the doctors but he didn't look at my legs... I was sat on a chair, he straightened my leg out and obviously it isn't the most comfortable position so he saw it was tender and referred me to physio. I start my physio in 2 weeks and I'm worried they're not going to see any issues or make it worse, because the swelling is not immediate. My nan, mum and sister all have arthritis, my mum and sisters are in the knees so I'm quite concerned this is never going to be addressed. Any advice on what I should do would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks Michelle	pain knee i get swell knee	hi look advice possible i get swell knee sometimes knee hurt usually hour i 've exercise i also get lot sharp pain knee shoot downwards morning even there extreme swell plenty liquid my knee stay slightly purple time joint go stiff sit i actually doctor n't look leg ... i sat chair straighten leg obviously n't comfortable position saw tender refer physio i start physio 2 week i 'm worried 're go see issue make worse swell immediate my nan mum sister arthritis mum sister knee i 'm quite concerned never go address any advice i would greatly appreciate many thanks michelle	Pain_C0030193_pain-knees_C0022742_knees-swelling_C0038999_swelling-knees_C0022742_knees	swelling_C0038999_swelling-knees_C0022742_knees-knees_C0022742_knees-sharp pains_C0455270_sharp pains-knees_C0022742_knees-shooting_C1444774_shooting-swelling_C0038999_swelling-knees_C0022742_knees-joints_C0022417_joints-sitting_C0277814_sitting-legs_C1140621_legs-chair_C1524106_chair-leg_C1140621_leg-swelling_C0038999_swelling-mum_C1009574_mum-arthritis_C0003864_arthritis-mum_C1009574_mum-knees_C0022742_knees	Arthritis	C0003864	'DefinitionDefinition\nArthritis is [[C0021368|inflammation]] of one or more of your [[C0022417|joints]].

97	Joint Pain with fever	My husband is suffering from Joint pain in his both feet with stiffness in neck from last 2 months. Firstly, there was swelling in his right foot with pain. We visited a rheumatologist and she recommended Diclofenac. The swelling vanished. But the pain was still there. By the time, he was also having continuous fevers. Doctor had done all type of tests for inflammatory arthritis and his HLA B27 test came positive. After some time when there was no improvement in pain, she recommended him Prednisone 40 mg. But that made my husband's condition even worse. After that he got swelling in his right knee. So we stopped taking prednisone afetr taking it for 3 days. Swelling got reduced. Doctor has done all type of tests but she is not able to get the reason for fever. She says fever doesn't occur in any inflammatory arthritis. My husband's father is also suffering from Ankylosing Spondilytis, so it makes us feel the same for my husband too but doctor rules out this option as she says fever doesn't occur in this condition. So, we are not able to understand whether its an Ankylosing Spondilytis or any type of inflammatory arthritis or not. He is not having any back pains. Is anybody having same kind of problems? We are not able to understand what to do next.	joint pain fever	my husband suffer joint pain foot stiffness neck last 2 month firstly swell right foot pain we visit rheumatologist recommend diclofenac the swell vanished but pain still by time also continuous fever doctor do type test inflammatory arthritis hla b27 test come positive after time improvement pain recommend prednisone 40 mg but make husband 's condition even worse after get swell right knee so stop take prednisone afetr take 3 day swell get reduce doctor do type test able get reason fever she say fever n't occur inflammatory arthritis my husband 's father also suffer ankylose spondilytis make u feel husband doctor rule option say fever n't occur condition so able understand whether ankylose spondilytis type inflammatory arthritis he back pain is anybody kind problem we able understand next	Joint Pain_C0003862_joint pain-fever_C0015967_fever	Joint pain_C0003862_joint pain-both feet_C0230473_both feet-stiffness_C0427008_stiffness-neck_C0027530_neck-right foot_C0230460_right foot-pain_C0030193_pain-rheumatologist_C0334889_rheumatologist-Diclofenac_C0012091_diclofenac-swelling_C0038999_swelling-pain_C0030193_pain-continuous fevers_C0424767_continuous fevers-inflammatory arthritis_C0003864_inflammatory arthritis-HLA B27_C0019740_hla b27-pain_C0030193_pain-Prednisone 40 mg_C1382730_prednisone 40 mg-swelling_C0038999_swelling-right knee_C0230431_right knee-prednisone_C0032952_prednisone-Swelling_C0038999_swelling-fever_C0015967_fever-fever_C0015967_fever-inflammatory arthritis_C0003864_inflammatory arthritis-fever_C0015967_fever-inflammatory arthritis_C0003864_inflammatory arthritis-back pains_C0004604_back pains	Arthritis	C0003864	'DefinitionDefinition\nArthritis is [[C0021368|inflammation]] of one or more of your [[C0022417|joints]].

99	Headache, Fatigue and ongoing upper left back ache?	Hey, This is my first time doing one of these health forums, but I thought it might help my own anxiety since I've already visited so many doctors in the past 6 months with multiple issues. I started to have health anxiety around July of last year, and since then I've done much better, but I still suffer from certain issues that I thought maybe asking other people could ease my worries and concerns. Starting with the more recent issues, I had a horrible headache the whole day yesterday that only slightly was relieved with advil. I thought it was stress or maybe I wasn't drinking enough water, but I woke up today with the same headache, a little less severe, but still frustrating and concerning. I don't really like taking too many advils or over the counter NSAIDS, and I don't want to keep taking them just to relieve some of the pressure. I did the worst thing you can do with health anxiety and looked online (ugh) and of course, that always makes every little symptom = cancer or some other disease. With the headaches I also have awful fatigue in the morning, even though I am getting 7-8 hours of sleep. I do have a bad habit of going to sleep around midnight, but I usually don't have problems falling asleep. The other issue that I've had since this past december is this weird, achey/strain I feel from my upper left ribcage (right below my breast) that fluctuates to the upper left back area right under the left shoulder blade. Some days its more worse than others, and it often comes and goes. Usually I feel it in the morning and not as often later in the day. I was quite concerned about it at first in December, but since then I've talked to my doctor about it, done blood tests (everything was fine), did an ultrasound (also fine) and it's still there. One thing I've noticed is that it hurts more after some sort of exercise, whether it be some sort of cardio or just yoga. I also noticed it really bothers me consistently the day after a night out of drinking (this is the worst it usually is since it stays the whole day). At this point, I'm more annoyed and frustrated with it more than anything, but unfortunately haven't gotten any answers from the multiple doctor visits I've had (cardiologist and primary doctor). The pain isn't severe, but it's almost as if I need to keep stretching because it feels like I pulled a muscle that just won't go away. Sorry for the long post...If you read all that I really appreciate it as I've been trying to reduce my health anxiety, but these constant symptoms, especially the upper back/upper abdominal strain doesn't help my worries. I do take Clonazepam (.5mg) and Prozoac (20 mg) and am a 22 year old female. Any advice is seriously appreciated! Thank you.	headache fatigue ongoing upper left back ache	hey this first time one health forum i thought might help anxiety since i 've already visit many doctor past 6 month multiple issue i start health anxiety around july last year since i 've do much better i still suffer certain issue i thought maybe ask people could ease worry concern start recent issue i horrible headache whole day yesterday slightly relieve advil i thought stress maybe i n't drinking enough water i woke today headache little le severe still frustrate concern i n't really like take many advil counter nsaid i n't want keep take relieve pressure i worst thing health anxiety look online ugh course always make every little symptom cancer disease with headache i also awful fatigue morning even though i get 7-8 hour sleep i bad habit go sleep around midnight i usually n't problem fall asleep the issue i 've since past december weird achey/strain i feel upper left ribcage right breast fluctuates upper left back area right left shoulder blade some day worse others often come go usually i feel morning often later day i quite concerned first december since i 've talk doctor do blood test everything fine ultrasound also fine 's still one thing i 've notice hurt sort exercise whether sort cardio yoga i also notice really bother consistently day night drinking worst usually since stay whole day at point i 'm annoyed frustrate anything unfortunately n't gotten answer multiple doctor visit i 've cardiologist primary doctor the pain n't severe 's almost i need keep stretch feel like i pull muscle wo n't go away sorry long post ... if read i really appreciate i 've try reduce health anxiety constant symptom especially upper back/upper abdominal strain n't help worry i take clonazepam .5mg prozoac 20 mg 22 year old female any advice seriously appreciate thank	Headache_C0018681_headache-Fatigue_C0015672_fatigue-back ache_C0004604_back ache	This_C1080058_this-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-headache_C0018681_headache-advil_C0593507_advil-water_C0043047_water-today_C0750526_today-headache_C0018681_headache-advils_C0593507_advils-counter_C0702263_counter-NSAIDS_C0003211_nsaids-pressure_C0234222_pressure-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-cancer_C0006826_cancer-headaches_C0018681_headaches-fatigue_C0015672_fatigue-hours of sleep_C2937255_hours of sleep-habit_C0018464_habit-breast_C0006141_breast-left shoulder_C0524469_left shoulder-shoulder blade_C0036277_shoulder blade-blood tests_C0018941_blood tests-ultrasound_C1456803_ultrasound-exercise_C0015259_exercise-cardio_C0018787_cardio-drinking_C0001948_drinking-cardiologist_C0175906_cardiologist-pain_C0030193_pain-stretching_C0600080_stretching-muscle_C0026845_muscle-anxiety_C0003467_anxiety-Clonazepam_C0009011_clonazepam	Back Pain	C0004604	'DefinitionDefinition\n[[C0004604|Back pain]] is a common complaint.

100	I Can't Sit due to left lower back pain (Page 1)	I have pain in my left lower back that is aggravated by sitting (this is a real problem as I have 4 hours of intense class for 4 hours every morning.). It is relieved by standing and lying down. While on my back if I try to stretch my right hamstring I get the pain. I can never seem to stretch the muscle and I don't get relief from muscle relaxers, nsaids, lidocaine patches, and only mild relief with vicodin. I am starting to do phsyioball and core exercises and have noticed that when I contract my glutes the pain is relieved. Sound familiar to anyone?

102	Lower back popping/muscle pain	Hello everyone, I should start by saying that I am currently deployed to Afghanistan. I have exhausted my medical options here because there just aren't that many. I am looking for insight into what might be causing my lower back issues. Here are my symptoms: 1) Lower back popping maybe a bit above my sacrum. This popping feels different to me than cracking of knuckles or cracking of my back when I do it intentionally. It is more a thud, and I think it might be a tendon, ligament, or something other than my vertebrae. 2) Here are the things that make it happen: getting up out of a chair after sitting for a while, getting up out of bed, and at the gym -- the captains chair is by far the worst, my back pops going up and coming down, sit ups, and other things. 3) I was able to get  (on my side and on my back) and my doctor wasn't able to see any issues. 4) We don't have anything else like an MRI 5) Typically, if my back pops a few times or if I go to the gym, I can feel a dull pain in the muscles surrounding where I felt the pop. I am 29, in good health, I exercise regularly. The only injury that I could possibly tie this to occurred back in November when I threw out my back doing kettlebell swings. However, I am not sure if that is when this started. Could anyone offer any advice? I have quite a few months left here, and I am curious whether I could be seriously damaging myself.	lower back popping/muscle pain	hello everyone i start say i currently deployed afghanistan i exhaust medical option n't many i look insight might cause lower back issue here symptom 1 lower back `` pop '' maybe bit sacrum this `` pop '' feel different `` crack '' knuckle `` crack '' back i intentionally it thud i think might tendon ligament something vertebra 2 here thing make happen get chair sit get bed gym -- `` captain chair '' far worst back pop go come sit-up thing 3 i able get xray side back doctor n't able see issue 4 we n't anything else like mri 5 typically back pop time i go gym i feel dull pain muscle surround i felt pop i 29 good health i exercise regularly the injury i could possibly tie occur back november i `` threw '' back kettlebell swing however i sure start could anyone offer advice i quite month left i curious whether i could seriously damage	pain_C0030193_pain	Afghanistan_C0001732_afghanistan-insight_C0233820_insight-Lower back_C2939142_lower back-sacrum_C0036037_sacrum-knuckles_C0025525_knuckles-tendon_C0039508_tendon-ligament_C0023685_ligament-vertebrae_C0549207_vertebrae-chair_C1524106_chair-sitting_C0277814_sitting-chair_C1524106_chair-sit ups_C0560837_sit ups-_C0043299_x rays-back_C0004600_back-MRI_C0024485_mri-dull pain_C0278144_dull pain-muscles_C0026845_muscles-pop_C0175314_pop	Back Pain	C0004604	'DefinitionDefinition\n[[C0004604|Back pain]] is a common complaint.

103	Small but painful insect bite	I hope this is the right place for this question. I have been bitten/stung twice now while in my back yard. I have a cedar deck and was walking across it and something bit/stung me in my calf (both times). They also bit/stung a dog I was watching once. The bug is quite small and I didn't even see it when it bit/stung the dog, nor the second time I was hit. I can sometimes see them flying around when the sun hits just right and they appear to be reddish/brownish and maybe half the size of a house fly. The bite/sting is quite painful and swells reddish for a few inches in diameter with a smaller yellowish swelling of about 1 inch in diameter, then a small red dot in the middle. The pain gradually subsides over a few hours, along with the swelling. It does not itch at all. The question is, what bit me? The follow up question is, how to I get rid of them? Geographical note: I live in Dallas, Texas.	small painful insect bite	i hope right place question i bitten/stung twice back yard i cedar deck walk across something bit/stung calf time they also bit/stung dog i watch the bug quite small i n't even see bit/stung dog second time i hit i sometimes see fly around sun hit right appear reddish/brownish maybe half size house fly the bite/sting quite painful swell reddish inch diameter smaller yellowish swell 1 inch diameter small red dot middle the pain gradually subsides hour along swell it itch the question bit the follow question i get rid geographical note i live dallas texas	insect bite_C0021564_insect bite	back yard_C0562731_back yard-calf_C1305418_calf-dog_C1280551_dog-dog_C1280551_dog-the sun_C0376223_the sun-house fly_C0020045_house fly-swelling_C0038999_swelling-dot_C0872145_dot-pain_C0030193_pain-swelling_C0038999_swelling-itch_C0033774_itch-note_C1316572_note-Texas_C0039711_texas	Insect Bites	C0021564	DefinitionDefinition\nMosquitoes-- and mosquito bites-- are annoying.

I washed the finger and got some green puss out of the sting sight. the sting site is purple in color. the skin on my finger feels very tight. I am unable to bend or straighten the finger. I also feel dizzy and now have a sore neck on the right side (could these be side effects of the anti histamine?)and generally don't feel good. this is my 4th sting in 7 months. the previous 3 were definitely wasp stings.

106	Scarring from tick bites ?	About 18 months ago I was bitten by a number of tick larvae after spending time in some bushland/scrub. I thought that they were baby spiders running up my arms so I didn't pay too much attention to them, except for brushing the odd few off. About 2 hours later, my armpits were becoming really itchy. I went to take a shower, and upon removing my shirt, I checked my armpits to see why they were so itchy. I discovered clusters of baby ticks attached to parts of my armpit. There was also one attached to my right buttock and one on my belly. I went to the hospital and they removed them. Turns out they were everywhere. After this, they looked like average, itchy insect bites. However, they became slightly raised (which also appeared normal, as they healed), and once the hyperpigmentation faded, I was left with these weird little patches of 'stretched', thin, soft skin where I had been bitten. I had been to the doctor and they didn't seem concerned at all - all they told me was that they weren't infected and the hyperpigmentation would go away on its own. The patches of skin are present on all sites at where I had been bitten, even if it was just one tick (although the areas where multiple ticks had bitten were only slightly larger in diameter- not too much - and had more tiny 'dimples' in them from the piercing mouthparts). I am really not sure what they are and how I could get rid of them - I don't feel comfortable wearing singlets/bikinis/dresses because the skin patches 'pop out' or go puffy when I put my arm down (you can see the ones on the side of my armpits that way) and go wrinkly when my skin is taut (such as when I lift or stretch my arm out). They're not painful nor cause any discomfort apart from feeling weird when my armpits are closed (just a little weird). Please help! I've searched up various insect bite scarring and even scarring in general and have never come across what I have. Thanks :) P.S. I'm from a country town in Australia.	scar tick bite	about 18 month ago i bitten number tick larva spending time bushland/scrub i thought baby spider run arm i n't pay much attention except brushing odd about 2 hour later armpit become really itchy i go take shower upon remove shirt i checked armpit see itchy i discover cluster baby tick attach part armpit there also one attach right buttock one belly i go hospital remove turn everywhere after look like average itchy insect bite however become slightly raise also appear normal heal hyperpigmentation fade i left weird little patch 'stretched thin soft skin i bitten i doctor n't seem concerned told n't infect hyperpigmentation would go away the patch skin present site i bitten even one tick although area multiple tick bitten slightly larger diameter- much tiny 'dimples pierce mouthpart i really sure i could get rid i n't feel comfortable wear singlets/bikinis/dresses skin patch 'pop go puffy i put arm see one side armpit way go wrinkly skin taut i lift stretch arm they 're painful cause discomfort apart feel weird armpit close little weird please help i 've search various insect bite scar even scar general never come across i thanks p.s i 'm country town australia	Scarring_C0008767_scarring	tick_C0040203_tick-larvae_C0023047_larvae-baby_C0021270_baby-spiders_C0037913_spiders-running_C0035953_running-arms_C0446516_arms-brushing_C0443165_brushing-armpits_C0004454_armpits-armpits_C0004454_armpits-baby_C0021270_baby-armpit_C0004454_armpit-right buttock_C1178870_right buttock-belly_C1009534_belly-hyperpigmentation_C0162834_hyperpigmentation-soft skin_C1844592_soft skin-hyperpigmentation_C0162834_hyperpigmentation-skin_C1123023_skin-tick_C0040203_tick-ticks_C0040203_ticks-piercing_C0935563_piercing-arm_C0446516_arm-armpits_C0004454_armpits-skin_C1123023_skin-arm_C0446516_arm-discomfort_C0231218_discomfort-feeling weird_C0857105_feeling weird-armpits_C0004454_armpits-insect bite_C0021564_insect bite-scarring_C0008767_scarring-scarring_C0008767_scarring-P.S._C0234833_p s-town_C0557750_town-Australia_C0004340_australia	Insect Bites	C0021564	DefinitionDefinition\nMosquitoes-- and mosquito bites-- are annoying.

107	Do I have lyme disease?	In the last 30 days I have been in forests of Missouri and was surrounded by a lot of ticks. Today I noticed a small red bite with a semicircular ring around it. The bite resembles some images of lyme disease online, except smaller, there's only one ring, and the ring is not full all the way around. I have no other symptoms at all. Is it necessary that I see a doctor immediately if this is my only symptom? Is it likely that it is just an aggravated mosquito bite or something?	do i lyme disease	in last 30 day i forest missouri surround lot tick today i notice small red bite semicircular ring around the bite resembles image lyme disease online except smaller 's one ring ring full way around i symptom is necessary i see doctor immediately symptom is likely aggravate mosquito bite something	lyme disease_C0024198_lyme disease	forests_C0086312_forests-Missouri_C0026222_missouri-ticks_C0040203_ticks-Today_C0750526_today-bite_C0005658_bite-ring_C1260969_ring-bite_C0005658_bite-lyme disease_C0024198_lyme disease-ring_C1260969_ring-ring_C1260969_ring-mosquito bite_C0417744_mosquito bite	Insect Bites	C0021564	DefinitionDefinition\nMosquitoes-- and mosquito bites-- are annoying.

108	Meningitis after effects	On Sunday, May 24, 2009 I started feeling bad. Thinking that I was coming down with a bug, I did not give it much thought. Monday (Memorial Day), I started feeling really bad, major headache, vomiting and fever. I decided I would hold out until the doctor's office opened on Tuesday. When I called Tuesday morning, I was told the the computers were down, call back in 2 hours. When I hung up the phone I thought I'm going to die, I need to get some place now. I was seen in the ER immediately and a spinal tap was done right away. Antibiotics were started as soon as the spinal tap was finished. The spinal fluid was pink. Is this reason for concern? Other than lab work, no other test were done. I was kept for the day and sent home with a diagnoses of 'viral meningitis'. It's been 3 weeks now and I continue to have headaches, nausea and no appetite. I go from freezing cold to sweating in a flash. I too, am having serious memory problems. I'm also having blurred vision in my right eye. My Doctor tells me that my symtoms are not from the meningitis and pink spinal fluid is no reason for concern. She ordered a bunch of lab work and told me she would call me IF any thing was abnormal. Could there be something else going on? Should I be concerned?	meningitis effect	on sunday may 24 2009 i start feel bad think i come bug i give much thought monday memorial day i start feel really bad major headache vomit fever i decide i would hold doctor 's office open tuesday when i call tuesday morning i told computer call back 2 hour when i hung phone i thought `` i 'm go die i need get place '' i see er immediately spinal tap do right away antibiotic start soon spinal tap finish the spinal fluid pink is reason concern other lab work test do i kept day sent home diagnosis 'viral meningitis it 's 3 week i continue headache nausea appetite i go freeze cold sweat flash i serious memory problem i 'm also blur vision right eye my doctor tell symtoms meningitis pink spinal fluid reason concern she order bunch lab work told would call if thing abnormal could something else go should i concerned	Meningitis_C0025289_meningitis	May_C0340978_may-feeling bad_C0231218_feeling bad-Thinking_C0039869_thinking-thought_C0039869_thought-headache_C0018681_headache-vomiting_C0042963_vomiting-fever_C0015967_fever-spinal tap_C0037943_spinal tap-Antibiotics_C0003232_antibiotics-spinal tap_C0037943_spinal tap-spinal fluid_C0007806_spinal fluid-viral meningitis_C0025297_viral meningitis-nausea_C0027497_nausea-sweating_C0038990_sweating-flash_C0262485_flash-memory problems_C0233794_memory problems-blurred vision_C0344232_blurred vision-right eye_C0229089_right eye-meningitis_C0025289_meningitis-spinal fluid_C0007806_spinal fluid	Meningitis	C0025289	DefinitionDefinition\nMeningitis is an [[C0021368|inflammation]] of the [[C0025255|membranes]] ([[C0025285|meninges]]) surrounding your [[C0545988|brain spinal cord]], usually due to the spread of an infection.

110	11 month old daughter had bacterial meningitis	I am lost as to what to do and could really use some advice. My oldest daughter contracted bacterial meningitis at 11 months old. Her pediatrician at the time was a family friend that I trusted. I was 18 and had no idea of what could be wrong. She was running a high fever for about two days and was lathargic didn't want to eat or drink. I called the Dr. and they squeezed her in at the end of the day with her Dr. We got there and they were just thinking that is was a urinary track infection so they wanted a urine sample. It took forever to get one since she did not want to drink and what they did get was not very much. They took it and came back and gave me a perscription for an antibiotic and sent us home. My husband worked nights so I took her home and had her lying in bed next to me when I realized that she was starting to have a seizure. I called 911 they rushed her to the hospital. The ER Dr instantly had a feeling that it was meningitis so instantly took a spinal. As she withdrew the fluid it came out almost milky white and on top of that she did not move or cry when they did the spinal tap. They admitted her to the picu and she got worse everyday! she became septic, her kidneys were shutting down and things were not looking good. Finally she took a turn for the better and slowly got moved out in the regular pediatric floor. She was there with a pic line for two weeks or so. When they figured out what strain it was and got her on the right antibiotic she was getting better. When the time came that they decided she was ok to come home they ran all the standard tests on her to see if there was any damage. She had lost her hearing (nerve) in her left ear, but the right seemed to be still normal. I know that the Dr. had misdiagnosed her and I was so upset with it, but because he was a family friend we did not file malpractice. Here we are 10 years later, we have found out that she had a stroke during that time. Her right ear has been fine but when I took her in for her annual hearing test they told me she was having some mild hearing loss in her good ear, and that it is probably going to start fading. I know we can put a hearing aid in that ear and there is this thing called the bone anchored hearing implant they can do for her left. I know this is what we have to do for her, but the costs are going to kill us and who knows what else we are going to have to pay out of pocket for. I am not a real believer in suing and because he was a family friend and I had grown up with his kids we did not file a malpractice claim. I am just having a hard time forgiving myself for not doing that for her so that she could have the means if needed. And I am told now that it is too late to do anything now. I am trying to be strong for her, but at the same time I am so angry and upset and sad. I just wish there was something we could still do to send a message to that Dr. that rushing us out of his office almost cost us our daughter. And he just walked away without a slap on the hand.	11 month old daughter bacterial meningitis	i lose could really use advice my oldest daughter contract bacterial meningitis 11 month old her pediatrician time family friend i trust i 18 idea could wrong she run high fever two day lathargic n't want eat drink i call dr. squeeze end day dr. we get think urinary track infection want urine sample it take forever get one since want drink get much they take come back give perscription antibiotic sent u home my husband work night i take home lie bed next i realize start seizure i call 911 rush hospital the er dr instantly feel meningitis instantly take spinal a withdrew fluid come almost milky white top move cry spinal tap they admit picu get worse everyday become septic kidney shut thing look good finally take turn better slowly get move regular pediatric floor she pic line two week when figure strain get right antibiotic get better when time come decide ok come home ran standard test see damage she lose hearing nerve left ear right seem still normal i know dr. misdiagnosed i upset family friend file malpractice here 10 year later found stroke time her right ear fine i take annual hearing test told mild hearing loss good ear probably go start fading i know put hearing aid ear thing call bone anchor hearing implant left i know cost go kill u know else go pay pocket i real believer sue family friend i grown kid file malpractice claim i hard time forgive could mean need and i told late anything i try strong time i angry upset sad i wish something could still send message dr. rush u office almost cost u daughter and walk away without slap hand	bacterial meningitis_C0085437_bacterial meningitis	bacterial meningitis_C0085437_bacterial meningitis-pediatrician_C0237433_pediatrician-high fever_C2055125_high fever-urine sample_C1610733_urine sample-seizure_C0036572_seizure-meningitis_C0025289_meningitis-spinal tap_C0037943_spinal tap-picu_C1046445_picu-kidneys_C0022646_kidneys-pic line_C0179740_pic line-hearing_C0018767_hearing-nerve_C0027740_nerve-left ear_C0229299_left ear-stroke_C0038454_stroke-right ear_C0229298_right ear-hearing test_C0018786_hearing test-hearing loss_C1384666_hearing loss-ear_C0013443_ear-a hearing aid_C2093335_a hearing aid-ear_C0013443_ear-bone_C0262950_bone-hearing_C0018767_hearing-slap_C1424461_slap-hand_C0018563_hand	Meningitis	C0025289	DefinitionDefinition\nMeningitis is an [[C0021368|inflammation]] of the [[C0025255|membranes]] ([[C0025285|meninges]]) surrounding your [[C0545988|brain spinal cord]], usually due to the spread of an infection.

111	Just tell me, could I have meningitis?	I have been having the strangest symptoms for 8 week straight now: headaches, pressure in head when bending over (not when coughing/sneezing/lifting), headaches in one spot when standing up, dizziness, smell phantom smoke smells, nausea, fatigue, big white floaters in both eyes, ringing ears, strange sore throat. It all started when I accidentally had rain water (we are on a farm, its stored in tanks fed from a roof) forced up my nose. Its winter here btw. Now I know I am anxious about it being a form of meningitis. With these symptoms I can't help it. I've gathered its too long to be Naegleria fowleri but now I wonder what other form I could have. TB? But out of 4 doctors GPs, 4 visits to the ERs and a neuro I consulted there, none even contemplated my symptoms linked to the water, let alone it being meningitis, when I posed the question. Can someone smart tell me, is it possible to have any form of meningitis after 8 weeks of ongoing symptoms from water up the nose? OK, I know anything is possible but .... In my understanding I would be the first person recorded to get any form of meningitis from water this way after 8 weeks from exposure and constant symptoms. I should be dead by now. After so many tests done (MRI, CT, blood, eye exams) which are all clear, this must all be in my head, which is fine by me!!	just tell could i meningitis	i strangest symptom 8 week straight headache pressure head bending coughing/sneezing/lifting headache one spot stand dizziness smell phantom smoke smell nausea fatigue big white floater eye ring ear strange sore throat it start i accidentally rain water farm store tank fed roof force nose it winter btw now i know i anxious form meningitis with symptom i ca n't help i 've gather long naegleria fowleri i wonder form i could tb but 4 doctor gps 4 visit er neuro i consult none even contemplate symptom link water let alone meningitis i pose question can someone smart tell possible form meningitis 8 week ongoing symptom water nose ok i know anything possible ... in understand i would first person record get form meningitis water way 8 week exposure constant symptom i dead after many test do mri ct blood eye exam clear must head fine	meningitis_C0025289_meningitis	headaches_C0018681_headaches-pressure_C0234222_pressure-head_C0018670_head-bending_C0011119_bending-headaches_C0018681_headaches-dizziness_C0012833_dizziness-smell_C0037361_smell-smoke_C0037366_smoke-nausea_C0027497_nausea-fatigue_C0015672_fatigue-floaters_C0016242_floaters-both eyes_C0229118_both eyes-ears_C0013443_ears-sore throat_C0242429_sore throat-rain_C0034640_rain-water_C0043047_water-farm_C0557759_farm-nose_C0028429_nose-winter_C0241737_winter-meningitis_C0025289_meningitis-Naegleria fowleri_C0027321_naegleria fowleri-GPs_C0272302_gps-ERs_C1704489_ers-water_C0043047_water-meningitis_C0025289_meningitis-meningitis_C0025289_meningitis-water_C0043047_water-nose_C0028429_nose-meningitis_C0025289_meningitis-water_C0043047_water-MRI_C0024485_mri-blood , eye_C0423009_blood eye-eye exams_C0200149_eye exams-head_C0018670_head	Meningitis	C0025289	DefinitionDefinition\nMeningitis is an [[C0021368|inflammation]] of the [[C0025255|membranes]] ([[C0025285|meninges]]) surrounding your [[C0545988|brain spinal cord]], usually due to the spread of an infection.
