0	Sinus infection and pain in collarbone ?	I started having a cough two weeks ago. It started affecting my sinuses about a week ago, so I started taking cold medicine. Instead of getting better, it just got worse. Three days later I would blow my nose and get green-yellow mucous. The next day I woke up and hurt from the crown of my head and down the left side of my head in my ear, jaw, neck, and shoulder. The pain was so bad it even hurt to eat. This is by far the worse sinus infection I have ever had! So, I went to the doctor. He prescribed an antibiotic and an antihistimine (my blood pressure was slightly up, which could have been because of the cold medicine, but it caused him to not want to give me a decongestant). i'm still hurting in my head, ear, and jaw, but not as bad. Mucous is still very colored. But, yesterday, I started hurting in my right shoulder--more like on the tip of the collarbone near my neck. It has some sharp pains, and sometimes dull and achy. I haven't done anything physically that would have caused this type of pain. It doesn't go into the shoulder itself, it just feels like it is in that collarbone. It does hurt also when I move it some and when I cough. Is there any way that this pain could be connected to a sinus infection or even to antibiotics? I'm just wondering because I really have no other explanation to the pain--if this is even an explanation.

2	Constant green phlegm for 2 years	I've had constant green phlegm (at first i thought it looked more like a dark almost browning yellow) for 2 years now. It started right after what my doctor told me was a bronchitis. Since then I cough up green chunks every morning. The green chunks are annoying because they get stuck at the back of my throat and sometimes makes breathing annoying when lying down. While I sleep some chunks get stuck on the top of my tonsils. It doesn't completely stop during the day, it keeps me coughing to clear up my throat. What alarms me the most about it is that my doctor has no idea what it is and has given me all kinds of nasal sprays, medications and antibiotics that didn't improve anything at all. I put this post under sinusitis since I was falsely diagnosed with chronic sinusitis by my doctor for a long time even though the  she made me take were negative. The hospital and an ENT specialist also told me I didn't had chronic sinusitis. The ENT says it is not sinus related. The problem is that my immune system is low since then and that I've been having recurring cases of strep throat or laryngitis. The green phlegm however is not clearing up after the strep throat gets treated or the laryngitis clears up. Other then the phlegm, I don't have any other constant symptoms, though at first I had chest pains in the upper middle of my chest but they weren't very frequent. Since I now consider my family doctor almost incompetent, is there a direction I should point her to? Should I go somewhere else? My next step I asked her for is to see an allergist, even though I have not noticed any allergies and even if I change my routine completely or live somewhere else for a while, nothing changes. Can it be stomach related? Can it be lung related? Can it be mold related?

3	Sinus Buster nasal spray ? (Page 1)	I've been hearing good things about it but before I buy it I was wondering if anyone else had tried it.

4	Any Success with surgery for sinusitis?	"Diagnosed with chronic sinusitis by ENT, but so far nothing making a change for the better. Quality of life leaves a lot to be desired for months now. Soon to have a re-evaluation with the ENT and possible recommendation for sinus surgery. BUT, no postings here tell of SUCCESS after a sinus surgery!!! Is success that rare, or is this just that those with success don't need further support and help from other patients? My CT scan showed congenital large ""Haller cells"" that are narrowing all other anatomy. Does anyone have any experience with this? Any help from your experience will be greatly appreciated."

5	Pain even after sinus surgery	I've been to many specialist and couple operations. I've given up. Sinus polyps surgery, deviated septum and the sinus and allergy is still there. Pain behind my right eye, ear, jaw, face, headaches, etc. I don't know what I have. I don't know if it's tmj or sinus infection or both. I've given up. I came to the realization that I may have to live and suffer for the rest of my life. What a sad life to live. Always tired and feeling fatigue. Sinus pressure and headaches throbbing as soon as I wake up. Life sometimes is almost not worth living. I take allergy pills. Pain killers and whatever else I can to not have to feel what I feel on a daily basis. I don't ever wish this on any person even my worst enemy if I had one...

6	sinus infection from extracted tooth	I got a tooth pulled 3 weeks ago .On the 5th day after the extraction when the pain was tolerable I blow my nose cause I was having a little congestion. Well after I did that the smell and taste of what ever came out of my nose was sickening! I knew right then I had an infection. It smelled like death. The following day I went to the doctor with my problem and he said it may and sounds like it was cause by the extraction to see my dentist again, he gave me 875 amoxicillin for ten days. I seen my dentist a few days later and told him what was going on and he said to just continue the antibiotics and if it didn't clear up to come back. Well ten days later I still have the infection and it is just slightly better if that. At night I can't breath and taking Sudafed 240 mg seemed to stop working for me I have a good nasal spray that helps me breath and clear some of the puss out. I went back to the dentist like they told me too and said I was doing fine. Although I still had the infection they were hesitant to give me more antibiotics. They gave me clindamycin, after reading tons of BAD reviews of the drug I'm not sure I should continue it. The healing of the extraction seems to be slow to me ,doc said it was okay but I'm not sure although there is no pain. I'm starting to think this is not going to be easy to fix .

7	Not sure what could be the problem? Elevated Lipase and Amylase.	I've been having sporadic stomach upset where I eat and then feel sick afterwards. It seems to come and go. Also sporadic IBS like symptoms. I could definitely eat better and more often and drink more so that's part of the problem but I'm trying to improve on this. About a month ago I had eaten around 5pm at night and I vomited around 3am and there were a few undigested french fries in there as if they had just been sitting in my stomach. I tried to augment my system with Apple Cider Vinegar. I recently had blood work done as well as Ultrasound, Xray and CT Scans. None of those imaging scans found anything aside from some barium from years ago in my appendix and some scattered diverticula which were not inflamed. FINDINGS: The imaged lung bases are clear. A tiny cyst is incidentally noted in segment five of the liver. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are otherwise normal. The stomach and the small bowel are normal in caliber wall thickness. Some inspissated barium is seen within the appendix, unchanged from comparison study. There is no luminal dilatation of the appendix. The colon is normal in caliber wall thickness. There are a few scattered noninflamed colonic diverticula. There is no abdominal free fluid. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. There are no enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Urinary bladder and prostate are normal. There is no pelvic free fluid or enlarged pelvic lymph nodes. Bone windows reveal no acute bony abnormality. IMPRESSION: No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis. However my fasting blood work showed: Lipase: 67 Fluid Amylase 149 Glucose 74 Anion Gap 17 Calcium 10.3 Globulin 3.9 All were out of range. There is no pain except when I have IBS related pain, almost a direct line across the bottom of my stomach and the sigmoid are where the diverticular pouches are. I get a colonoscopy every 5 years because of Familial Polyposis, but I did test negative on an APC Gene mutation and they said I was back in the general population as far as risk. I've had no issues with polyps at all having been checked every 5 years since I was 20 and I'm now 43. I will do another one just to be safe. Do you feel I should have an upper endoscopy to check my stomach? Sometimes there is a dull ache on the left hand side and I of course worry about stomach or pancreatic cancer, but I have no symptoms as of yet just the blood work mentioned above. Thank You!

8	4 attacks of acute pancreatitis in the past 5 months	Hi I am 24. I had my first attack of pancreatitis in August with my lipase level in the 2000s and had a CT scan and ultrasound. They said I had a gallstone so they removed my gallbladder and said there were two stones and some sludge. In October I had the same pains again and went into the ER and my lipase level was in the 2000s again. They did another CT scan which was clear. They said that they believe it was probably just a stone that had fallen through and wasn’t removed during surgery which had irritated my pancreas but I had passed it. The beginning of November I had the pain return and my lipase was once again in the 2000s. This time around they did an MRCP and checked for autoimmune disorders. The MRCP came back completely clear and the test for the autoimmune came back negative. This one was my fault. The doctors and surgeon never told me I had food/ alcohol restrictions so I had consumed a fair amount of alcohol Halloween weekend and ate a good amount of pumpkin seeds and the pain came while I was eating the seeds. They then told me I needed to be on a low fat diet and absolutely no alcohol. Since then I have been on a strict low fat diet. I don’t eat anything over 3g and I have not touched alcohol since that Halloween weekend. On the 23rd of December I woke up and was having a low fat fat breakfast of lean turkey sausage and egg whites when I felt a really sharp sudden pain. I thought it wasn’t the same since I’m the past it’s been more gradual and progresses from discomfort to pain. This time it was very sudden and more painful than before. I go into the ER and my lipase is once again in the 2000s but this time around the pain is much worse. I am calling the nurses in every 20 minutes because the morphine had worn off and I can’t stand the pain anymore. They up me to Dilauded and the pain starts to get better. In the morning they do a blood test again and my lipase rose to 9000!!! They did a test a couple of hours later to see if there was a lab error and my lipase was in the 6000s. This has never happened with any of my other attacks they always went down over night. They did another MRCP which is completely clear and just recommend I go see a specialist for a EUS. Never had any other symptoms with my attack besides upper abdominal pain first three times it was center left but the last time was center right. Never had issues with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or increased heart rate. Even though I did drink on Halloween weekend I’ve never been a big drinker at all. I would have 1 maybe 2 drinks a week so they do not think it has anything to do with drinking. My cholesterol is good. I don’t take any medications that have a correlation with pancreatitis. I have no family history of pancreas issues. I am having the EUS next week but I am just worried that it wont lead me to any answers. The doctor said 20% of people have idiopathic pancreatitis and that you just learn to manage but I don’t want to keep getting pancreatitis every month to month and a half. All the doctors and surgeon have said they are certain that the first attack was because of gallstones but if it was and then the second attack was because a stone slipped through and the third attack was because I didn’t know you weren’t supposed to drink while the pancreas was healing why did I get it the 4th time? I was trying really hard with my diet and doing well. I am overweight but since this has started happening I’ve been trying to be healthier eating and excercise wise and have lost 35 lbs since August. I was wondering if anyone had any insight or any thoughts on what could be happening. I am scared of this turning into chronic pancreatitis. Also I know I am being a worry wart but if there were tumors or anything on my pancreas that would have shown up on the CT scan or MRCP, right	['Diarrhea and vomiting, symptom', 'Breakfast', 'Cholangiopancreatography, Magnetic Resonance', 'Pain', 'Nausea and vomiting', 'Unreliable laboratory result', 'Upper abdominal pain', 'Insight', 'Alcohols', 'Fever', 'Thinking, function', 'Malaise', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Skin Papilloma', 'Cholelithiasis', 'Pancreatitis', 'Morphine', 'Neoplasms', 'Tachycardia', 'Lipase', 'Pancreatitis, Chronic', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'Endoscopic Ultrasound', 'Cholesterol', 'Autoimmune Diseases']	['Acute pancreatitis', 'Pancreatitis', 'Traumatic AND/OR non-traumatic injury']	['Pancreatitis, Chronic', 'Abdominal Pain', 'beta2-Adrenergic Agonist [EPC]', 'Presenile dementia', 'Cholesterol', 'Morphine', 'Bumetanide', 'Malaise', 'Inflammation', 'Acute pancreatitis', 'Glucose', 'Fever', 'Pancreatitis', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Pain']
9	Distal Pancreatectomy, Splenectomy, Pancreatic Abscesses	"Hi, my husband had distal panceatectomy and splenectomy 3 weeks ago, came home for a couple of days and had been in hospital since as he developed infection, it was treated and re-occurred. The CT scan seems to reveal pancreatic absesses, formed (from what I read on the net) from infected pseydocysts. The first operation was complicated with massive blood loss and a part of the infected pancreas wasn't removed due to the complication. He has been on anti-biotics continually for 7 weeks now. My question: We have had a tough time throughout this whole process and I would like to know the complications that can set in from further open surgery, they might re-enter through the original cut to drain all the abscesses. If the draining operation is done and the abscesses clear, is it something that can re-occur? He lost a lot of weight and doesn't need insuline or other enzyme producing medication. Is there a risk to this surgery? Is the pancreatic abscesses the ""last"" complication we can expect from the original operation? The doctor's have not been providing a lot of information...."

11	Pancreatitis - What is causing it?	Hi everyone, I'm 22 years old and I've been having flare-ups since March 2010. I didn't go to the hospital until my recent acute attack in July. Unfortunately, they assumed I was too young for pancreatitis and didn't even test my amylase or lipase and instead assumed I had an ulcer and suggested a follow-up with a gastroenterologist. Several invasive tests later, after finding no ulcer, I was sent for a simple blood test which determined elevated enzymes and diagnosed with pancreatitis. They had me eating jello and chicken broth for about 2 weeks before I could start eating some solids. My symptoms were: chronic abdominal pressure/pain, back pain, trouble breathing especially when lying on my back and anxiety. After a month of healing I felt perfect. Then suddenly... sitting at my computer and eating dinner, my upper abdomen and left chest were in excruciating pain (different from my July attack). Once I could actually move I went to the hospital. They only set me up with a Nurse Practitioner who did a blood test, found my amylase to be about 60ish and sent me home. After that I just kept hurting worse and worse, feeling it in different areas of the abdomen after eating this time. I started feeling nauseous, which I didn't get with the July attack, so nauseous I went about 5 days without so much as a sip of chicken broth before returning to the hospital (I went to a new one this time). They found ketones in my urine (anorexia I assume?), elevated Basophils , High Bili total (it went from a .9 in July to 3.7 in September). Im also iron deficient and found I have some acid reflux when they did an edndoscopy in July. I've had every test imaginable (and multiple times) - MRCP, CT scan, Ultrasound, X rays- all producing normal results. Currently, I'm on max daily doses of Protonix and Pepcid AC (for about 2 weeks now). Obviously, I don't drink alcohol and I never did smoke or drink caffeine. I limit fat intake only and avoid foods which seem to aggravate my stomach. I'm constantly dehydrated no matter how much water I drink and my blood pressure has been high (quite high) for months. I'm all of 110lbs and otherwise healthy. My gastroenterologist suggested an ERCP next but apparently there's a long waiting list to see a specialist for the procedure. I'm starting to lose faith in all these doctors as the emergency room keeps sending me away and my doctors want to diagnose it as chronic pancreatitis with an unknown cause - end of story. I'm only 22 years old and obviously this has been devastating. But the worst part is just not knowing - ANYTHING. So I realized I'd have to find out all I can and ask them to do specific tests/procedures in order to get my diagnosis. Is this auto-immune, chronic, just acute? How do I find out? What kind of blood tests should I request? What red flags should I be looking for? What do I eat? Should I find a new doctor? Any reccommendations of hospitals/doctors that actually provide results/diagnoses? What could be causing it? Absolutely anything at this point would help me. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.

12	Diet and exercise with Pancreatitis	"I'm 23 and I was just diagnosed after a bad attack with acute pancreatitis. Diagnosed as unknown causes. It occurred after a night of mild drinking and a day of work, exercise, and a protein shake. I exercise a bunch(probably 4 or 5 times a week) put on 25lbs in the six months leading up to the attack (also quit cigarettes this last year). I weigh 170lbs and I am 5' 10"" . Now I think my problem might have been me burning the candle at both ends so to speak.. I exercised a bunch, drank often and smoked marijuana regularly, I also work full time. My attack was very painful and I will never drink again. I want to smoke marijuana occasionally but also think i might have to quit that completely. My question is this. If I eat carefully (less than 30g of fat a day) eat fresh fish, veggies, fruits, soy....If I do that can I still work out 4 to 5 days a week in the hopes to gain a little more weight? No more supplements exempt the occasional vitamin. Would it be dangerous to gain maybe 10-20lbs a year? I just want to weigh 180- 190lb lean or...it's a personal goal...If I cannot I can live with that...I better get used to doing things on my pancreas' terms right?"

13	chances of diabetes after a severe attack of acute pacreatitis	Hey guys, I am 16, I'm from England. And this time last month, i had a really severe attack of acute pancreatitis due to gallstones, and was in intensive care and everything - it nearly took my life. But I'm alive and wellish now, and i've had a laproscopic cholecystomy so it shouldn't happen again (touch wood!)My surgeon told me i am at a high risk of getting type 1 diabetes in the future, so i was wondering if anybody knew my statistical chances are of getting it and if there is anyone in a similar position to me, I would love to talk to you and exchange stories.

14	Acute Pancreatitis (Page 1)	I was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis when I just turned 21. I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich ,than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E. When im with my friends. I've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana?

17	Low Blood Pressure And Weight Gain	I have been on blood pressure medicine for years. I've been on many diets and it's hard to loose weight no matter what I try. My sister had me use her watch that checks your pulse rate. My pulse was between 63 and 65 (I tried it more than once). That was my resting pulse rate. She thought that was pretty low. We checked my dad's and his was around 75. I'm 49. I go to the gym 3 times a week. My Dad is 79 and has arthritis and doesn't walk much. No matter what diet I try I can't loose weight. I thought after 7 months at the gym I would be loosing weight. After seeing my pulse I remembered about the blood pressure medicine I'm on. I take 50 miliigrams of Atenolol and 20 milligrams of Enalapril every day. Atenolol I remember reading, is a beta blocker and it slows your heart rate down. Is it possible the Atenolol is why my heart rate is so low and actually keeping me from loosing weight? Your feed back is much appreciated!

19	Low blood pressure while exercising	I am 33 years old and have had strange symptoms, mainly headaches, dizziness and fatigue, I just got all my blood tests back and my blood work looks normal. I was getting an orientation at the YMCA on the circuit. I was only at the 2nd machine when suddenly I felt dizzy. This happens all the time lately, especially if I do more than a lazy workout (lately I can only walk on the treadmill at a slow pace). I guess my face turned extremely red. The personal trainer took my blood pressure. My blood pressure was 95/74 (I accidently posted 85 instead in another section) and the heart rate was 71. She took it again five minutes later and it was 111/83 and heart rate was 79. She stated that I couldn't work out at the Y until I got a doctor's clearance. I guess this shows I could possibly have a heart condition. Even when I walk on the treadmill, I get slightly dizzy and feel like I am going to fall asleep. My resting heart rate used to be at 90, which was pretty high but was normal for me. It is just strange that with exercise, my pulse and blood pressure went down. Anyone hear of such a thing? Very very strange. Anyone else experience this? It's just strange that my resting blood pressure is normal and my heart rate is higher when I am resting as opposed to working out. I just went to the doctor's today and the resting EKG was normal, which doesn't surprise me. He was concerned about my valves. My mom has valve problems (forgot the official name). I will be getting an stress-EKG at a cardiologist in the next few days. In the meantime, I can't exercise or do anything strenuous.

20	orthostatic hypotension alternates with high blood pressure.	"hi- i was recently diagnosed with autonomic orthostatic hypotension. However, I NOW have HIGH blood pressure (uncomfortably high) about half the time, stomach/digestion problems, and low blood pressure and related sx the rest of the time. My doctor ""gave up"" in me because he said that true autonomic orthostatic hypotension DOES NOT alternate with high blood pressure. I am currently without a doc and don't know what to do! I take clonidine to lower the high blood pressure when it occurs (usually at night and after eating.) On the days I have the low BP and I am passing out, of course I don't take it. The low BP/fainting started first - tilt table test proved I had AOH - but these new sx are killing me - literally. I feel as if I am going to have a heart attack when my pulse gets so high (130) and then suddenly plummets to 35. (I have an EMS and medical background so I know how to monitor these sx).

21	Vaso Vagal Syncope	Hello Ive got Vaso Vagal Syncope.. Ive had it for several years and have been well prodded and diagnosed. However ive never found anything thats even remotely improved my situation. In the past ive worked as a fitness instructor and i was ok, but recently it has become so bad that im struggling to even exercise a bit, Which for me is very alien, I can (or should i say could) spend hours in the gym and love it and be somewhat unaffected, I just wondered if anyone else has this problem? Im hoping ill return to my normal ways and have days where i feel ok to do exercise and things but at the moment i dont see a light at the end of the tunnel.. Its even affecting my job which is simply a typist job sitting down. So if you can help respond...

22	No Diagnosis After 5 Years	My 24 year old daughter has these symptoms. Constantly dizzy, faints 4 -6 times daily. During this time it could last 1min. to 1 hour, at this time she does not respond to pain stimulus, or anything. She cannot hold food,water, meds down. Thus she will become dehydrated. She was on a feeding tube for a while but this had to be removed. She is very tall but weighs very little at this point. Because of fast weight loss and other factors she now has a pacemaker. We have been to numerous Hospitals and Doctors all over the United States. She has yet to be diagnosed. This is her 5th year of being ill. She had to drop out of school and cannot drive she cannot hold a job. She can walk to her mail box only because she knows her neighbors and if they see her on the ground they know she will wake up and will wait by her for her safety. If anyone has heard of these symptons please let me know.

25	BP goes up after meal	In the last few monts I had 4 cases when my BP increased about 10 minute after I eat lunch. From Normal to 150/95. then slowly after few hours went to normal. For the last 3 years i have been eating only the right food and exsersizing 30 to 60 min every day. I have been eating salads and chicken and fish , no pork or beef. My wife is cooking whitout salt, and I'm very strict on eating low sodium food. The salt I replaced with hot peppers. And No problems for the last tree years. And suddenly high blood pressure. In the last 3 monts i had 3 blood tests. fist test total cholesterol 246/HDL 55/VLDL 20/LDL 171 ; TSH 0.146 after 1 month second test total cholesterol 189/HDL 52/VLDL 15/LDL 122 ; after 3 monts Last test total cholesterol 241/HDL 54/VLDL 18/LDL 169 ; TSH 0.302 And because one of the rises of bp after eating was 170/100 my doctor put me toprol 50mg. and he want to test the thyroid levels. While waiting for the lab order to come in the mail I start searching the net for answers. I suspect Hyperthyroid. I start looking about the iodine i take with the food , and I remember that all the cases of high BP are day after I had a fish for diner or lunch. So I don't know the answer. Is the hyper thiroid become hyper active after meal or is always hyper active? Maybe something else is trigering this HBP. I'm afraid to eat. I cant eat the bad food, the good food is not good anymore for me. I just hope that this is something temporary. Also often last mont I have nasal congestions and I'm using afrin.

28	Hypertension at early age	Hi. I am male, 27 years old and diagnosed with hypertension. Before that, i have a horrible experience when my bp reached 200/120 last January 27, 2017. I don't have any idea what causes that. Fortunatelty, i did not have stroke. After that incident, i monitored my bp for 2 weeks as advised by my dr.

29	Use of Apple Cider Vinegar for Lowering High Blood Presure ? (Page 1)	I checked my blood pressure at a grocery store it read 149/89 and this was on Saturday and I have been online to check on how to reduce it naturally. I started taking apple cider vinegar on Monday and went to the doctor on Tuesday and my blood pressure went down 128/86.

30	Rapid changes in blood pressure	"38 year old male, 5'9"" and 145 lbs. - Lately when I take my blood pressure, I notice large changes with each passing minute. For example, I sat down and two minutes later I took my blood pressure. It was 155/88 with a pulse of 87. I waited a minute, took it again, and it was 135/78 with a pulse of 78. I took it a third time and it was 124/78 with a pulse of 73. Should I be worried about high blood pressure? This has happened twice over the past two days. Should I sit longer before taking my initial bp? I do suffer from anxiety attacks, and this could also have something to do with it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

31	Fibromyalgia symptoms	Hi all, I will try to keep a super long story short. I went to my GP about a week ago after going to weeks with a growing pains in my right shoulder and upper arm. An xray came out fine, I was prescribed 800mg ibuprofen. Two days later the pain went to my right shoulder/arm with tingling and coldness in that hand.I was prescribed a steroid and muscle relaxer. I went back to my GP today.. Almost a week later. I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety and says i have 12 of the 18 trigger points.I have aching muscles in my upper arms, shoulders, neck and down my back. They do not hurt more or less while I'm doing things but do tend to get a tired feeling. Not all spots hurt at once..( One day a shoulder the next day my neck.) But it will remain constant. Also, my joints both shoulders crack/crunch or pop with movement. The Prednisone I was prescribed doesn't seem to be helping much. Im going to an Ortho in less than a week and we will go from there. I do not want to jump the gun but was wondering if these are perhaps symptoms of fibromyalgia?

33	Calf muscle pain and high cholesterol	I have copied this from a post I made in diagnostics and testing section. I am hoping someone can tell me if this sounds like fibromyalgia or something else. Hello everyone, I am new here and have yet to make an introduction, that will come next. I am truly hoping someone here can help me out. My sister has fibromyalgia and my neurologist recent diagnosed me with it, although I feel he hasnt done any tests that can really confirm it. Anyways, I have had a lot of tests donw this year and I have got copies of all of my results. I am hoping with the communities help or maybe a doctor I can figure out what is going on here. For the past several years the calve muscles in my legs (both of them) have been hurting severely. My entire body hurts and aches but half the time I dont even notice anymore because my legs pains are dwarfing any other pains. I have had an mri of my brain for the purpose of a ms diagnoses, and that appeared to be fine. No strokes or anything like that (thank god i'm only 34). I have tachyardia and high cholesterol so most doctors jump on the, its you heart bandwagon. I have had every test done on my heart as a result and they all come back ok. So with the heart ruled out, I had a bunch of blood tests ran, all were fine except for my cholesterol of course and my RF factor. It was elevated, I can give exact numbers if needed. My ana and all the other tests came back fine so I was reffered to a rheumatologist. She felt my hands and said she could feel they were inflamed, and ran a bunch of other tests. They all came back normal as well. I had asked her to test for muscular dystrophy because of all my symptoms and how long this stuff has been going on, obviously I have done my own research to figure out why I am hurting and to get answers. I know all labs are different, the lab they use seem to have higher reference ranges, not sure if that could cause a problem. Well my rheumatologist drew blood for aldonase serum or something like that. It came back 7.6, but anything under 8.5 is considered normal for the lab. I have had the nerve prick test and it showed mild to moderate neuropathy in my right leg which doctors said most people have that. A mild dehydration in my upper spine the neruologist again said was normal for a full time student looking at a computer. If the exact tests I have done are needed I will supply all of them and the reults, im in just so much pain and noone seems to be able to help me.

34	Does Fibromyalgia cause severe breathing problems?	I've had Fibromyalgia for the past 20+ years now and in all that time my breathing has got worse and worse.

35	Can fibro cause neuro problems?	Hello all. I am getting a little frustrated with doctors lol. I keep getting bounced around & no one seems to have a DX for what is going on with me. The neurologist I am seeing now seems to think I have fibromyalgia but I am a little confused because a lot of what I have going on (other than the pain) seems to be neuro symptoms. I am hesitant to believe I have fibro since it seems to be a catch all DX for when they cannot figure out what is wrong & I just don't believe my symptoms are the same for fibro. So my questions is... can fibro cause/does anyone else have these symptoms with fibro??? Migraines, numbness/tingling of extremities & face, kaliedoscoped vision, small tremors in hands, recurring sinus/upper respiratory infections, dizziness, muted sensations, unexplained bruising on lower back, hives/rashes, swelling of extremities? I've tried to do some research online about fibro but most of what I read deals with the muscle pain, sheath tears, & cognitive issues. Any info would be greatly appreciated. THANKS!!!!

36	fibromyalgia causing shoulder and neck pain	hello. i have these pains in my shoulders, shoulder blades and neck. my doctor told me that i have fibromyalgia. he sent me to a masseuse, physiotherapist and even gym works. he gave me some meds for it like mersyndol forte, but none helped. most nights i would have headaches starting from my right frontal section and will spread all throughout my head. i wonder if my headaches and shoulder pains are connected. i'm suffering from these for 7 months now. i went to a pain specialist and suggested that i have an ultrasound. they found out that i have bursitis so they injected me with cortisone. this helped for a while but after a week the pain came back. i really don't know what's wrong. i am stressed out about my condition because i can't function normally. it's a bit depressing because after working, i'd be really sore that i can't do chores at home. i can't even play with my daughter because the pain stops me. i've been to three specialists but none of them can't put a name on it or explain to me what's happening.

37	Pain in palm of hand while gripping something??	Hi everyone I was diagnosed with CTS a few months ago . I was having that tell tale sign of fingers going numb for months before but it wasn't every night. I also started to get tingly fingers and hands doing my job duties. Finally went to the dr and she said she suspects CTS. She sent me to get a nerve conduction test and that showed i had CTS in both hands , but more in my right. I was surprised I had it because I do not work a desk job. I work with adults that have developmental disabilities. But, I do lift weights and do crossfit, so I think it may be caused from that. Anyways, I was wondering if you guys with CTS also feel a pain in the meaty part of your palm when gripping items? Maybe not so much as a pain, but cramping and tiredness? If I'm using a screw driver, I have to stop a few times . I had to brush off my car today and scrape it (Silly Canada, dumping snow already) and I had to take many breaks because my hands were cramping up.

I can't remember any injury, maybe I slept on it wrong? I can't even hold a cup of coffee right when I get up. I wake up with an ache on the underside of my wrist, pinky side every day. Usually, I get out of bed bearing weight on the wrist, but it can't bear any weight. I have tried immobilizing it using a brace, but it seems to make it worse. I am using advil and cold packs, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything. What makes it better is use and specifically when I actively 'stretch into the pain"" and hold. I did this yesterday morning and it got to the point where I almost forgot about my aching wrist. It seems rest is brings back my pain. At this point, I can almost use my wrist normally, (aka holding things, bearing weight on it, etc) The doctor's office told me to continue icing and using advil and call back in a couple of weeks if it continues.

41	Recovery after Carpal tunnel Surgery? (Page 1)	I am scheduled for right hnad surgery on September 25. My main question is, how long is the minimum recommended time off work a person should be taking? I do a lot of things with my hands and of course i am right handed. Lots of computer typing, stapling, hole punching and a lot of grasping like opening ziplock bags of things as all our orders are kept in those. Even now I am dropping things, have pain shooting up both arms and even have headaches and neck pain from it. I even already have the pillar pain, so I'm hoping the after surgery effects wont be waaaay more severe than what i have currently, but I don't wnat to go back too soon and cause healing problems. I don't get paid for the time off, hence the minimum time away that is considered safe. I realize everyone heals differently, so its obviously a lose guess, but i would be very interetsed in others work experiences and how long they needed off, just so i can have a ball park as to what to tell the boss.

42	Hard to make a fist. Help!	I was recently diagnosed with carpal tunnel. The doctor who performed the tests said it was a mild to moderate case. Although my hand always hurts, sometimes it is much more tolerable than other times. This happened to be one of the rare days where the pain wasn't as bad. I wonder if I went on a day when the pain was very bad if the results would have shown a more serious case? I am writing mainly because it always hurts to make a fist. Some days it is worse than others, but it always hurts nonetheless. The pain feels like it is mainly in my middle finger. I can feel a bump/pop in the base of my palm when I try to make a fist. I can do it, but I have to squeeze hard and it hurts very bad. If i accidentally fall asleep without my wrist brace, I won't even be able to close my hand at all when I wake up. I'm just wondering if this is a result of my carpal tunnel. I assume it is, but I can't find any information about someone with my specific problem on the Internet. I do deal with the regular side effects as well such as tingling and numbness. Is the pain when I try to close my hand normal too? Any information would be appreciated. If it helps to know, I am a 22 year old male. Average height and weight.	['Pain', 'Numbness']	[]	['Carpal Tunnel Syndrome', 'Weakness of hand', 'Pain', 'Fungizone', 'Numbness']
43	Omeprazole	I just saw my ENT doctor about throat problems (coughing, trouble with hacking mucus, mucus not coming up with cough and hacking), he said all my problems were due to acid reflux and prescribed me Omeprazole (he also told me to take less of the ranitidine, which I admittedly had been taking a lot, and to not take Tums because the calcium causes more acid), and then gave me a referal to a gastroenterologist. My question is regarding the Omeprazole. My doctor didn't say how long I should take it. I know you're not supposed to take it long term, but I don't know why not. The box says not to take it for more than 14 days, and says to only take once a day. My doctor said to take twice a day, and didn't say when I should stop.

45	How to Cure Acid Reflux Disease Naturally	Hi, My brother's girlfriend works in a health food and herb store, she's told me that deglycyrrhizinated licorice (or licorice root...in supplement form) can be used to help relax the stomach. Basically what she said was that it acts as a natural stomach coater, it also helps with digestion and heartburn (and inflammed muscles for those who have nasty chest and back pains) to ease that icky burning up the esophagus. If you're going to try it, make sureee and i can't stress it enough that it's Deglycyrrhizinated licorice, because if it's glycyrrhizinated then it may give u high blood pressure. So far it seems to relax my GERD quite a bit, it may not be a complete solution to medication but it's worth a try. Anyway, take care.

46	Acid Reflux Help	One year ago I was suffering from severe reflux. My GI doctor prescribed a PPI, which I took for several weeks. The reflux stopped, but I started to get nausea, gas, abdominal pain, so I stopped taking the PPIs. I ended up traveling up to a clinic in Washington state. The doctor name was Jonathan Wright. They gave me a Heidelberg pH Test and found that I had weak stomach acid. I was told that I should have never been prescribed a PPI, for low stomach acid. After running several different tests, I was told that the PPIs threw my digestive process out of balance. The doctor told me that I was seriously deficient in several vitamin and minerals, especially B vitamins. They prescribed a natural product to rebalance my digestive process and vitamins and minerals. The reflux and nausea did not reoccur. Dr. Wright had previously suggested that I should have a second Heidelberg test, to monitor the treatment protocol he set up for me. Two months ago I went back to Dr. Wrights clinic and had a second Heidelberg test done. The test indicated that my digestive process has returned to normal and my vitamin and mineral absorption had greatly improved.

48	PPI's Prilosec & Nexium - causes gastritus (Worse than reflu	PPI's - Prilosec & Nexium. Severe reactions & damage are happening to many people. Many of them unaware that their solution is causing similar but a new host of problems. I am suffering with gastritus and have had the worst year of my life physically since taking prilosec. Many years ago I had reflux from a high stress job and coffee, etc.. After a parent died, and a severe reflux bout, I didn't understand reflux. No one explained eating lots of small meals.. or laying down on an incline, or sitting up three hours after you eat.. or cutting out wine, chocolate, sauce, spices coffee.. though I figured some of that out. Instead I too Nexium for SIX Months... fearing to get off it.. but I couldnt stop the nerves I had and my mother realized it WAS the medicine. So I stopped and slowly got back to normal.. that was in my 30s. Flash forward.... some reflux again in my 40s... I find out I have POLYPS in my gallbladder.. WHY? welll reading on reactions it says some users get stomach polyps too!. Not good. But not realizing I took Prilsec again for two months. Older and more vulnerable to reactions, I went by ambulence for TWICE for the first time in my life after taking prilosec. I also had a knot under my stomach that got worse and worse.. all the while thinking it safe and not strong enough for reflux going wild.. NOT REFLUX THOUGH.. it was Gastritus! far worse.. ruining my digestive system. Soon I was unable to drive ... !! totally a basket case physically and mentally. Then I couldn't sleep... SLEEP APNIA!! digestion impossible at night a NIGHTMARE. Weeks off the prilosec and I could walk outside take a shower more confidently but the rumbling in my stomach made my sides hurt for MANY months and I felt like I had to hold the walls when walking down stairs...!! insane I know I was an athlete and this really ruined my year. Friends drove me around for months.. and then slowly helped me drive again.. with them in the car. My arm and fingers were getting numb after eating. Spice would make me feel like I could pass out! But it was just pressure. I still cannot get up in the morning and not need to eat quickly or I will face horrible gastritus making me feel like I could pass out. Heart is good.. every test...moniter, you name it..... Endoscopy all good no hpylori, no woman cancers... all checked... even a head scan..all ok but now I am radiated! oh well thanks for the additional risk factor. It was prilosec and the generic equivalent being dished out by doctors who think they need to give you something for you to want to go there. The FDA has been aware of the over the counter and prescription PPI's (omeprazole and other similar names) and they are not properly warning people.

50	Quitting Omeprazole 40mg	Hi I am 19 doctor put me on Omeprazole 40mg a day for 21 days but I want to quit earlier.. Didn't realize the terrible rebound and side effects that could happen. I got on it because of acid reflux, palpitations, and chest tightness after eating. It worked but I'm feeling better now and I am just terrified if I get off of it it will become worse.. Would it be fine if I quit cold turkey and took tums/Pepcid for the issues? Or would I have to gradually wean off of it? I have only been taking it exactly for a week.

51	low ferritin level not responding	For the past 11 years i have ben sufering from worsoning symptoms of anemia. It started as tiredness and over the years has gotten steadily worse. Now my symptoms are.... -severe fatigue -extreme breathlessness so severe that at times i pass out -bluish tinge to my lips -pallor -hair loss/thinning -angular chelitis on both sides of my mouth -extremely slow healing -irregular heartbeat -exhaustion -depression -cognitive impairment -pica It sounds like a normal case of anemia that has been untreated but im not anemic. The levels of iron in my blood and my red blood cells have been persistantly normal. My doctor has been taking blood every 2 months for the past few years trying to get to the bottom of this. She has ruled out..... -pernicious anemia -thyroid problems -various cancers -coeliac disease -haemochromatosis -internal bleeding -psychosomyic causes my blood test results are always the same..... I get normal results for- Hb (hemoglobin) RCC (red cell count) Hct (haematocrit) MCV (mean cell volume) MCHC (mean cell haemoglobin concentration) MCH (mean cell haemoglobin) RDW (Red blood cell distribution width) White cells/ lymphocytes normal Platelets normal B12 normal I am a healthy weight and have no other illnesses. The only test which comes back abnormal is my ferritin (iron stores) level. It is 4 and has been 4 in every test. It should be 12. I have tried various iron tablets but they made me sick. My doctor finally found one i could tolerate along withnan iron rich diet but after six months my ferritin was still 4. I have taken courses of iron injections and that has also failed to raise my ferritin. The doctor tried giving me higher doses and it didnt work. She theorised that the iron being injected was immediately taken up by my blood and not stored so i was taken into hospital and given iron overdoses and still no change. Basically i have a persistent iron store level of 4 despite all attempts at treatment. Even though my iron stores are low the iron in my blood is alwyas a healty level 13 but despite the fact that technically because of this i dont have anemia i have all the symptoms. None of my doctors know how to proceed. They tried a blood transfusion but since imnot actaully anemic it didnt make any diference. Im starting oxegen therapy soon due to passing out from breathlessness. I feel like im going to die if someone cant figure out whats going on.

53	My Story And a Possible Solution to Itp	I had full-blown thrombocytopenia purpura for quite a while. My platelet count dropped to 4,000. They gave me prednisone for a long time and the count kept dropping after the the dosage was reduced. In early tests my spleen wasn't functioning abnormally and I did not have any form of cancer. My eukaryocytes were abundant. But somehow the count was still dropping. I took matters in my own hands and did a lot of research. Ascorbic acid (vitamin c) fights off infections. I took four ascorbic acid tablets per day. My platelet count lingered around 70k. Then slowly began to drop again. The vitamin c had some effect to say the least but did not stop the pestilence. Since that wasn't quite the answer, I did research on other vitamins. The potassium vitamin actually caught my attention first. It seems that potassium is an antagonist to rat poison. Rat poison makes the rats bleed internally. Potassium strengthens cells. After I started taking the potassium with ascorbic acid, my platelet count jumped to eighty thousand. Three months later, it was at 120,000. Now it has been three more months and I haven't experienced any negative affects. It seems the disease has lost its potency. I no longer have nose bleeds, fatigue, nor ruptures underneath my skin. I'm not saying this is the answer for everybody... But it seems to be working for me. Sadly the doctors laughed it off. It seems they are more afraid of losing money from the drug companies but i'd rather not conclude that. It is just a thought. And there is always the chance that there is another reason why it just got better on its own. This isn't likely considering nothing worked until I took these vitamins. I was just ecstatic when I started to get better. Overall, I recommend for any suffering individuals to try this treatment. This isn't for cancer patients, etc. Obviously. It may or may not work, but when I was sick I tried everything I could (that wasn't dangerous). Don't overdose on it either! I wonder if it has a chance of working on others. If anybody else tries this, please leave a response. Then maybe give me an update a month or two.

54	Is my anemia getting worse or is it something else?	I was diagnose with anemia a few months, I am 16. I have been taking iron tablets, but the other day i was in class and got really dizzy, i left the room and the teacher came out, tried to keep me talking and kept telling me to breathe. It's almost like my body wanted to pass out but i was fighting it, if that makes sense. I was shaking uncontrollably, and was starting to hyperventilate. I was finding it very hard to breathe, my face and arms went numb and i was struggling to talk. at that stage i was laying down with my feet up on a chair, the next thing i know there's 2 teachers running towards me, when they got to me they had their hands around my wrists trying to find my pulse, they struggled to find it. I couldn't keep my eyes open, and my face went as white as a ghost. I don't remember much of what happened, but what i do remember, it's not very clear in my mind. I'm really scared it'll happen again, do you think anemia is getting worse? Also is there anything i can do if that happens again?

56	Type 1 diabetic - Stomach problems (Long burps)	I've been having really back stomach problems for several months now. The main problem is my burps get trapped in my stomach daily and it feels like I'm going to fall over. It takes time, but finally it starts... 10 to 20 second burps, it's not fun. Sometimes it'll last for up to 30 minutes. Also I've developed Acid Reflux... and it feels like a heart attack every time. My bowels are never consistent and had my gallbladder removed about 10 years ago. I've been type 1 diabetic for 24 years now and afraid it's only going to get worse. I've lost about 15 lbs. in the past month. I'm only 34 yrs. old. Also I started exercising everyday, but it seems like it's just triggering it. I cut out all soda and caffeine drinks. Some days the only thing I can eat is toast and crackers. I had to go to the E.R. a couple times, but they can't find anything wrong besides anxiety and reflux... something isn't right. I've had a stress test and gastric empty scan and passed both. I'm in the process of switching doctors because he won't listen to me... he thinks it's all anxiety related. I'm just wondering if anyone else has these problems and if so, what are you doing to help the symptoms? It's killing me... I take 80 mg of prilosec and half a bottle of gaviscon chews daily and a couple alka seltzer. That can't be healthy Any help would be appreciated.

59	Diabetic Neuropathy; Celiac Disease	Hello All. I am new to this so please be gentle. I am 27 and I have type 1 Diabetes, for 20 years. Diagnosed with Celiac at 17 I have had pain for almost 5 years now and it is getting worse. I am unable to go a night without having my entire arms numb and tingly (so uncomfortable and odd feeling) and when I wake up I feel the most atrocious horrifying pain in my life! I just was seen by a new doctor, a pain management specialist, who was quite sharp with me by the way, but offered me some help once I told her I would rather get my prescriptions from my primary because he has been my dr for over a year now. She said she needed to see my chart and my tests that were done and go from there but the pain is getting worse and worse! I have a baby, he is 5 months old, and since he has been born the pain has been getting worse. I am assuming it is from the holding and feeding and putting to sleep of lil guy, and other things as well. I am also wondering if my celiac has anytihng to do with a nerve damage interaction. Probbly not but thought I'd ask anyways. I am on 60mg MSContin 3x a day every 8 hours; Norco 10/325 4x a day (but has been becoming more like 6x per day since the pain has been getting worse) I really need to get some insight on how this is affecting me in the long run. Will I lose all sensation in my arms and hands in a year from now?? What should I do in themorning when the pain is to the point where I want to just scream andcry!?

62	High level of blood sugar.	Hello this is my first post. So my father has a type 2 diabetes. He is 68 years old and thin. He has no other health problem except diabetes. Even though my father exercices everyday walking and riding bicycle his blood sugar stays at high levels. He does take medicine for the illness. Also his diet is pretty strict too, he doesnt eat any food that has sugar. Maybe only the bread might be the case but its black so i think there is no problem there either. Today he tested his Fasting blood sugar at the morning after being tired from exercicing and it was 190. After eating lunch it was 240. This has been happening for a long time so it is not the first time. Also my father might had diabetes for 20 years and more. But it has been only 6-7 years after he noticed it. So is this normal for a person that has diabetes or not? Maybe his body is used to that level of blood sugar?

63	Type 1 Diabetic with severe muscle spasms	I'm a type 1 Diabetic for 30 years. About a year ago I started having muscle twitching which escalated in to muscle spasms. They have become severe and very painful. I've tried Neurontin 1800mg per day which worked to lessen the spasms for awhile. When that stopped working they put me on Cymbalta 30mg twice a day which worked for about 3 weeks. Then they put me on 30mg Cymbalta and 300 Neurontin every 12 hours. This combination has now stopped working. PLEASE HELP ME!!! I am so frustrated and losing hope of finding relief. I am forced to take Ambien every night because I cannot sleep without it because of the pain. Please, anyone been through this? Any advise/suggestions? Please help!!

64	Over weight diabetic husband with leg cramps	Hello - My husband is 6ft, 330 pounds. He has been diagnosed with diabetes now for almost 10 years. After not controlling his diabetes for several years he has been put on incillin. For the last 4 years he has been getting leg cramps. Sometimes in his calfs other times in his upper thigh. When I say leg cramps I mean severe, can't move can't breath, horrific cramps. Lately, it has been happening every night. I am so concerned that even at 43 this has something to do with his heart and he is on the verge of having a heart attack, but he is convinced it is a result of a back surgery he had 13 years ago. We have checked his blood sugar when the cramps take place and it is not low nor extremely high. We have also tried eating bananas, v-8, TONS of water and potassium pills. None which seem to help. Are these symptoms a sign of his heart struggling or is this symoptomatic of something else. PS I know you can not diagnose over the internet, but opinions and otherwise educated advice would be greatly appreciated.

65	Crohn's Disease treatment options	Well, here is my story. In Sept. of 2004 I had my gallbladder removed. After that everything went downhill. My bowel movements were like pure bile The doctor said that was normal after gallbladder removal and things would get better. After 5 months of this and constant trips to the bathroom my doctor that removed my gallbladder referred me to a GI doc. Feb. 2005. She did a colonoscopy and said it was Crohn's disease. Said there was alot of inflammation and several ulcers at the terminal ileum. I started out on sulfasalazine and Took that for 6 months then started Pentasa. After a year on the meds I was doing much better, seemed to have things under control. Doctor told me she didn't think it was Crohn's disease after all because she thought the ulcers may have had to do with the anti-inflammitorys and antibiotics I was on for a sinus infection I was so relieved this was Feb. of 2006. I was finally off all the medications. Well, in March of 2007 the symptoms started coming back full force. I believed it was just stress and read alot about gallbladder removal, and thought this was all normal. Finally in August of 2007 being totally exhausted and wondering what this could be I went back to my GI doc. She did another colonoscopy and said it was definatly small bowell Crohn's disease I was floored. This couldn't be happening. She started me on sulfasalazine again and Entocort for three months. Then, onto pentasa again. After going off the entocort things started getting worse again. After 10 days of being off Entoctort she put me back on it for another two months. I have been off of that for three months now but still taking the pentasa, and many vitamins Folic acid iron twiceTwice-a-day a day, vit. D,Calcium Magnesium , mutivitamin, and omeprezole. She did another calprotectin test and sent it to the mayo clinic, it came back Back at 413 (o-50) being normal. Aug. of 2007 it was 455, then in Dec. down to 339, then in march 229. I was sure it would be closer to normal at least hoping I guess. Anyway, she wants to do another colonoscopy in two weeks and for sure start me on 6-mp or Imuran. Maybe humira or remicade. I am so terrified of going on any of these. All I read about is all the bad side effects and it scares me to death If anyone is on any of these please give me some advice. I have been reading on natural substances like barleygrass and that all sounds good but not sure if it would actually help seeing how bad this flare has gotten...Please help....

68	Random Stomach Pain/cramps Throughout the Day	i have crohns disease. i was diagnosed about 5 months ago. did the steroid thing, and it got everything to normal, never had any flare ups or anything after the prednisone steroid treatment put it into remission or whatever its called. so everything has been fine and i have continued taking asacol daily. so everything was fine and normal and i was happy =) but the past few days i have been having random stomach pains/cramps throughout the day. it only lasts for 30 seconds to a minute. and i get it as often as every 5-10 minutes or every half hour or hour throughout the day. it started about 4-5 days ago. i once had food poisoning last summer, and the pain kind of feels like that, just not as intense (anyone that has had food poisoning knows how bad it hurts/feels) so this felt sort of like that, just not to the point where i had to lie in bed all die in extreme pain like food poisoning. im still able to go about doing daily things, and it hurts, just not as bad. so the only thing i can describe it as is similar to the pain i had when i had food poisoning but just not as bad as that. ive also noticed that my gas (farts) smell a LOT worse than normal. like a nasty rotten smell lol. which is fun when you have roommates and want to annoy them. anyway i was wondering what this pain i am having might be and if it is related to my crohns (hopefully it isnt). if anyone knows what this might sound like or knows anything at all please reply and help me out. if you need more info from me let me know. thanks everyone	['Crohn Disease', 'Flare', 'Steroids', 'Food Poisoning', 'Flatulence', 'Prednisone', 'Pain']	[]	['Sore to touch', 'Abdominal Pain', 'beta2-Adrenergic Agonist [EPC]', 'Muscle Cramp', 'Visceral Myopathy', 'telithromycin', 'Diarrhea', 'atomoxetine', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Crohn Disease', 'Malaise', 'Inflammation', 'Proteins', 'Ulcer', 'Flatulence', 'Malnutrition', 'Decrease in appetite', 'Pain', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Prednisone', 'Food Poisoning']
69	diarrhea and anxiety	Hi, i'm recovering from a surgery to remove appendix and part of my colon after some really scared and inflamed tissue related to a history of Crohn's Disease. I'm trying to get to eating solid foods after being out of surgery 1 1/2 weeks but a couple of times I've had what seems to be severe diarrhea and when that happens its accompanied with my whole body feeling hot and cold. I feel unsettled mentally and if I lay down it feels like a yo-yo back and forth from a hot flash to a cold flash and then back.. Also, i get a feeling of being disconnected mentally and i have anxiety and it almost feels like i'm close to having a panic attack. Its like I just cannot be mentally calm and my mind is racing and jumping all over. When the diarrhea is over i feel drained and I'm really tired. If I get sleep and relax its gone and i'm better and back to normal with not much anxiety. From that point i may be okay for a while but if I happen to have the bad diarrhea again i'll feel the same. What should I do about the diarrhea and what are everybody's opinions about the anxiety? Has anybody heard of this? Any suggestions on how I can eat to lessen the chance of diarrhea or anything else would be awesome... its seems like my anxiety and diarrhea are related.

70	Crohn's post-op	Hey About six months ago I had to have a bowel resection, as my disease went undiagnosed for a while. It ended up that I was very seriously ill. Part of my illness is that my bowel formed a fistula with my bladder. This infected my bladder, which in turn infected my right kidney and blocked it up (doctors told me that if it went on for much longer I could have had kidney failure). I have had a lot of treatment since then but have noticed a few things in the last month. I am not taking any anti-crohns disease medication yet, I am only on an Iron and multivitamin supplement at the moment. But I am having the following symptoms, please tell me if I have something to worry about, or if I am looking too deeply into these: - Every now and then, my left kidney is twitching (this isn't the one that was fully infected). It feels as if it is beating and pulsating. - Any time I check my heart rate (at rest) it seems to be quite high. It can be anywhere between 90 - 126 beats per minute. - Occasionally I am getting headaches. the front of my head hurts. - Diahorrea all the time (although I understand that there are things I shouldn't be eating now that I can't digest everything lol) - Breathlessness. This could be even from running up 2 flights of stairs at home, which I have never had any problem with. This breathlessness only lasts for about 10 seconds and then I'm fine. - My thumb keeps on doing this thing where if I try to hold it still, it moves and twitches itself, and no matter how hard I try to keep it still I can't. (this is probably completely unrelated) That's all. Please let me know if I'm just havering (as we say in Scotland) and I have nothing to worry about, or otherwise.

72	melanoma on R. arm - Breslow depth 0.6mm, Clark's level 111	Hello all, I may add way too much information but since I don't really understand anything of what my doctor told me I don't know what to add and what not to. My main concern was that she told me she wasn't going to put me under anesthesia when she removed my melanoma...lol...she said it would leave a very large scar!! Who doesn't put someone asleep when they do surgery that leaves a very large scar?? Anyway, Yesterday my dermatologist informed me that the scrape biopsy she did on my upper right arm came back as the following: Skin: upper tight arm; invasive Malignant Melanoma, Nevoid Type, Breslow Depth 0.6mm, Clark's level 111 with Involved Peripheral Margins. Under Comment: Step level sections show epidermal consumption and a poorly circumscribed compound melanocytic proliferation. The dermal melanocytes demonstrate significant cytologic atypia and I see no maturation with increase in dermal depth. There are numerous mitotic figures. The findings are most consistent with an invasive malignant melanoma nevoid type. The Breslow depth is 0.6mm and the Clark's level is 111. A lymphocytic host response is present but not brisk. The mitotic rate is 4 per mm2. I see no lymphovascular invasion or ulceration. Hhhhuuuu??? Any help with just putting that into a few simple words. AND - why aren't they going to put me to sleep to remove this???

74	squamous cell skin cancer	I am a 33 year old male and just recently noticed a brown spot about one inch below my waist. It has been there for ten years because I remember seeing it and I just thought that it was a mole. Last week I was paying attention to my pubic area because I had a seborrheic keratosis that was itching and noticed that this spot looked bigger than what it did ten years ago. The dermatologist biopsied it and it came back squamous cell. I do not know if he removed the mole by a shave or excision technique. Either way he removed the mole. He said my treatment was Aldara cream for twelve treatments and that I needed to come back in a month. I was confused so I called back and the nurse said that I caught it early and that the cream would suffice and that if it was invasive I would get complete excision or be referred to a specialist. My question is if this is an appropriate method for my diagnosis? If the cancer was deep enough then exicision would be more appropriate correct? Also, is the pubic area anything to be concerned with since it is an uncommon area for skin cancer? The only reason that I can think of it not being in a non-sun exposed area is genetics. Any input would be appreciated as this is worrying me to death and I am losing sleep.

75	Diagnosed with SCC	I had this pearly skin lump on my upper shoulder blade same color as my skin for about 5 years. i was never really concerned . over last 6 months had changed in color, size, developed red veins and a scab in the center. A few weeks ago started bleeding so i went to the doctor, Did biopsy... diagnosed with SCC. GO tomorrow to have excision of tissue... my concern is if it could have spread, because i have had it for a long time... what should I ask my doctor tomorrow?

76	Melanoma Skin Cancer	my mom was diagnosed with melanoma last year, she had it in her neck then she had it cut out... she has not gone back to the Doctor since October and this summer has been laying in the sun all summer, she puts 4 sun tanning oil on, and lays in the sun for at least two hours a day, I dont know too much about all of this so I was wondering if anyone knew how bad this is and what are the chances she probably has it again and how bad might it be? I'm 22 years old I know little bits about the caner but not much, so if anyone could help me out and give me information on how serious the situation would be I would really appreciate it	['Sunbathing', 'melanoma', 'Oils', 'PTPNS1 protein, human']	['Skin Cancer', 'Primary malignant neoplasm of skin', 'Cutaneous Melanoma']	['Basal cell carcinoma', 'Merkel cell carcinoma', 'melanoma', 'Skin Cancer']
78	Aldara For Actinic Keratoses	I recently had mohs procedure done to remove squamous cell carcinoma on my scalp. The scar has healed, and my dermatologist prescribed Aldara cream to be applied daily for about 3 weeks to a large area on my scalp where there are several actinic keratoses visible (she biopsied them). After 8 hours I wash it off. My concern is about the side effects I keep reading about Aldara. I've used it for 2 nights in a row now and am already feeling flu like symptoms and have noticed that my occipital lymph node is swollen and tender. Other than some slight itching, I'm not having much reaction at the site of application. Could the other symptoms be related to the Aldara or have I just been reading too much on the internet?

79	MS & hysterectomy	I do not know if anyone can help / give advice regarding this but... In February 2017, I was diagnosed with MS. Fast forward to eleven weeks ago on February 14, 2018 (of all days)I had a complete hysterecetomy. This hysterectomy was sudden, as uterine cancer had been discovered. (My mother had died from uterine cancer.) Thankfully it was caught in the early stages, and requires no further treatment. My main issue with MS has always been leg weakness, more than anything else. The first 3 weeks after surgery I was feeling great and getting around reasonably well. The next day, (22nd day) I bottomed out with severe leg weakness, aka bedridden for almost a week and the weakness has been up, down, and all around since then. It's now 11 eleven weeks after the surgery. I read numerous other posts re hysterectomy experiences, but none seem to be like mine. Mine may be more profound / intense as I had a day surgery just 4 months earlier to remove a benign parotid tumor, that ironically was discovered the same time as my MS, in a MRI scan. So I basically had 2 surgeries within 4.5 months. I've contacted my MS Clinic, a few times, and they say I have to give it extra time, especially since its two surgeries in less than half a year. Not that the 2nd one was elective... cancer is cancer. They say I've basically been hit by a truck twice... give it more than the average time for recovery. Do not really have a choice. Has anyone else been through similar, or knows of anyone who has? Is there a 'light at the end of this tunnel' so to speak? Thanks for any input!

80	Confused, newly diagnosed, need some help on what to do	I was recently diagnosed with MS. I've come to terms with the diagnosis, but I'm going for a 2nd opinion on Friday since the original Neurologist did not perform a lumbar puncture as he said it wasn't necessary and he was 99% positive MS was my diagnosis. MRI's have shown multiple lesions in the brain and 1 lesion in my cervical spine. Typical symptoms for me have been cold/tingling feet, calf twitching on both sides (primarily right) and tingling sensations in both hands. Lhermitte's sign is very present and quite frustrating. I read a lot about remission in terms of MS but I have been experiencing some sort of issue for about 4 months with maybe 1 or 2 days where I have felt normal. Not to get too personal but things with my wife and I have been troublesome over the last month and I have experienced 4 instances where my left arm gets a sudden rush of pins and needles, my fingers lock and I can barely move the limb...the tingles eventually spread up my left shoulder and then my right arm begins feeling the same sensations but to a slightly lesser degree, in each instance there has been an extremely stressful situation at home preceding the attack. My question is if this is actually a possible MS symptom or if I should go to the hospital to ensure I am not having mini strokes of some sort, my understanding is that TIA's typically attack only 1 side of the body. I have 1 uncle that died from stroke, aside from that there is no family history. I am 30 years old and these attacks scare me to no end. I would have gone to the hospital last night but my wife was out all night with friends from work and I couldn't leave the house with my 3 year old daughter there....couldn't dial a phone and could barely drive anyway, much less pick up my sleeping child and put her in the car. The attack lasted roughly 2 hours, the intensity started to fade after about 30 minutes. Any help or advice on this issue would be appreciated. Thank you.

82	MS and second condition involving the brain?	At 23 I went to the dr because I had been lactating for several years. I was also experiencing balance problems, not severe, but didn't mention that. I was sent for an MRI for the lactating as he suspected tumor on pituitary gland. A few days later I was told I had MS. The next day the neurologist sent me for lumbar puncture and I was officially diagnosed with MS. The lactating problem was forgotten by drs. since focus was on MS. it's been 4 years and I have been on copaxone, tysabri, IVIG, rebif, Gilenya, and had stem cell treatment in Costa Rica. Nothing has had any affect. I am now bedridden. I went from balance problems to tremors to the point I cannot use my hands to feed myself or do anything else, I cannot walk at all, I cannot sit up on my own, my vision is almost 100% gone, my speech and thinking ability are impaired, I have no bowel or bladder control. No meds help, no treatment helps and I've not been able to find one case of MS that has progressed this quickly. I am wondering if the initial problem, the lactating, could be a sign of a second problem such as a brain tumor or something else. The Neurologist focuses only on my MS symptoms and wants me to go on chemo for it. I feel that something else could be going on since this has progressed so fast. I also have pain in all my joints. I know I have MS, or the MRI's certainly show lesions but I've had no new lesions in 2 years yet the progression continues. I am desperate. My swallowing has been affected so I am only on Ensure Plus and still have choking incidences. I am so scared.

83	Just got diagnosed with ms...what should i expect?	I am 5 months pregnant and have been told for the last five months that the numbness in my hands was pregnancy carpal tunnel. Finally 2 MRI's showed a lesion on my spine and several lesions in my brain. I have two young children and one on they way and am so scared and feeling guilty that I will not be able to care for them. The numbness in my hands has not subsided after a round of steroids and my whole body has begun tingling when I move a certain way. Is there anything that can be done for my hands now or are they permanently numb? Any information people can give would be great. Thank you.

84	Elderly With Dementia	Some people always ask the same questions repeatedly. They experience sudden mood swings frequently, and feel very agitated and anxious very easily. At times, they wander about aimlessly, yell, start crying, or display emotions of combativeness and aggression.

86	Severely winded and short of breath	Tonight I've been experiencing a significant amount of shortness of breath. I do have asthma, allergies, and anxiety all which I know can be contributing factors. These shortness of breath episodes I experience have been going on for around 11 days and onset every evening around 6 P.M. or later. I've been light-headed tonight to the point of unsure if I can get enough air to keep myself from seeing purple colors and stars when going from sitting to standing. I don't feel this is orthostatic hypotension, but I feel it is progressively getting worse day by day with no change to blood pressure medicines. I'm struck by chest pains around the left ribs some nights while laying on my left side and it is enough to wake me up at times if I am drifting off to sleep. The windedness gets significantly worse even after doing activities as simple as walking to class and back which is in total less than a mile. I am only 22 years old, but am trying to get into pulmonology but am extremely crammed with time and classes. I have had times recently where I've experienced lots of dizziness even while resting and an increased heart rate of up to 94+ beats per minute with frequent episodes of ringing ears throughout the day while at rest. I don't know what is going on, but whatever it is is being exacerbated by any use of synthetic testosterone, zoloft, dexedrine, blood pressure medication, caffeinated beverages or exercise. All of these factors seem to greatly increase the difficulty in breathing and I am unable to convey the severity of my situation to many people I know. I have had 2 times standing up in the past 11 days where I lost my balance slightly but was able to regain balance before falling which is a new symptom that I don't usually get. However, these symptoms and issues don't occur to the fullest extent until in the evenings. I've additionally had random incidencies of extreme cold intolerance to the point my hands, feet, and nose have turned a slight dark blue color after use of dexedrine, caffeine sources, androgel, or zoloft. I am taking high doses of multivitamin supplements, have been also taking DHEA 10 mg capsules and Wellbutrin occasionally and with little consistency.

88	Persistent cough	I am curious if the cough I have had since December 2015 (that is when I first really became aware of it)is related to asthma or something else. Any suggestions will be appreciated. I had a couple of asthma attacks when I was a child, the first one at age 7, then an attack in my twenties when I was expecting my first baby. As I was constantly breathless I was put on a preventer - Seretide and I have been on it since then, I am now in my seventies. I walk often. I feel well though sometimes breathless climbing stairs or walking up hills. (I stop for rests then continue) so I asked my Dr. if I should stop taking the preventer. I was referred to a lung Dr. who did tests (I'm afraid I can't remember the name I think it started with Spir) after I went off the preventer several days before hand. He said the results mean I still have asthma (mild I assume). I was on Prednisolene for a 2 weeks and antibiotics before that) I also use Avamys nasal spray. He changed my preventer to Fluxotide, then to Symbicort over about 6 weeks, I am now on Flutiform but I am still coughing, sometimes a little phlegm comes up and I more than often have to clear my throat as it feels like something is there. I hope I have supplied enough information for someone to be able to offer a suggestion.

89	Need some advice on breathing problems	Hello everyone, My name is Chris. I just want to start by saying sorry if this post is long, but I want to make sure to be as detailed as possible. I grew up with asthma since I was a baby but had it under control most of my life. I'm currently 30 now and for the last 5 years my health has been very bad and I'm trying to find answers. Any kind of help will be appreciated. I was diagnosed with breathing problems and asthma when I was 3. I was sent to the ER a number of times in the late 80s before the doctors had me purchase a nebulizer machine and got a rescue inhaler. I had the classic signs of asthma, wheezing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing in colder weather. After using medication though I would feel brand new and it would work well. One thing I want to mention and I'm not sure if this will be helpful, is even when I was diagnosed with this at a very young age, I would always, always get good numbers on my peak flow, and would be in green. This would give me a lot of trouble later on by other doctors or professionals thinking I didn't have any asthma related problems because I would do well with it. I never had much of a problem dealing with my health from then on until my mid 20's. Fast forward to about 5 years ago, and something started happening that I'm still searching for the answer. It's difficult for me to explain but I will try my best with what happens on a regular basis: When I wake up in the morning, my breathing is very shallow. If I try to breath in fully, my lungs will stop me. when I breath out completely, I will have faint wheezing. Using my albuterol inhaler opens up the airway slightly so I can breathe in completely but it doesn't' stop this feeling from going away. I will then cough up yellow mucus through out the morning, and tend to clear my throat a lot. Other symptoms are: coughing more, nose being stuffy, sneezing. All of this would still be tolerable to me if it wasn't for the worse thing, which is my lungs. When I try to do any physical activity (I have tested this) whether it's doing moderate exercise or just doing 1 set of push ups (so anything that seems to make my lungs work a little bit) my breathing gets significantly worse after about half an hour after I have exerted myself. I will have this incredible fatigue that continues to get worse every hour and will last for about a full day, and my breathing really hurts. I have tried using my inhaler before or after exercise, warming up properly, using a mask indoors to exercise, none of it helps. This will happen to me every single time I do it, no matter what physical activity it is as long as I use my lungs a little bit more than just walking around. I have been to two different regular physicians and two other pulmonologist during the last 5 years, and nobody can figure out why this is happening to me. Another thing I want to make a point of that is important, is during this 5 year period there are bouts of about 1 to 3 months where my breathing actually goes back to normal, and I can exercise with little to no effort, and I'm not on any medication. I have tried writing all of the times down this happens, but there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern if it's based on allergies or weather, time of year, etc. It just seems random. I also have acid reflux since I was in my early 20's, but I do eat properly and I never change my diet when my health is either fine or doing bad. Some of the medications I have tried are: Singulair, Advair, Flovent, Spiriva, over the counter allergy meds, and Omeperazole for the acid reflux. I have had the methacholine challenge done and the results say I don't have asthma anymore. It is strange because the feeling I get from difficulty breathing doesn't feel like the classic signs I had as a child. This year I was fine from January through March until I got the flu from work, and then afterwards it hasn't gone back to normal again. Here are some bullet points for reference: - My symptoms stay for months but have gone away a few times a year - breathing is aggravated more so by any physical activity that requires my lungs to work, something I never had a problem with in my early adulthood. fatigue will set in for a full day afterwards - I have had allergy testing done and I know I am allergic to only cats and dogs, but I don't own either and my house is very clean. - I grew up with asthma and medication did help me, but this current feeling of when I'm sick all the time doesn't feel like classic asthma anymore, and albuterol rarely helps. - My current doctor believes it could be a sign of allergies still or GERD, but has no explanation of why its fine a few times a year for a month or so, when I never changed my surroundings or eating habits. - I don't drink or smoke Thank you again everyone for any help that I can get, it means a lot to me. It has affected my quality of life to the point where I'm very depressed these days because I can't get an answer, and when I do feel better for a few months it is so hard to go back to this pattern where I can't exercise anymore and feel terrible. I have tried researching all of this myself online and in books but the main thing I cannot find anywhere is the feeling of my lungs being so fatigued and painful hours and hours after exercise, most reports or articles I've come across say asthmatics are fine after they've taken medication before or after.

90	new here, confused allergies and/or asthma?	Hi 30, smoked at least 10 years, with periods of on and off.... live in a VERY polluted city in latin America. 5 years. quit cigs in jan, smoked weed and then when started getting a tight chest the following day and/ or slight diff breathing in smoky environments quit and removed situations from life started wih increasing tight chest after exposure to smoke... this developed to include some slight mucus prod. went to the beach for 2 weeks and all symtoms pretty much went away, got bak to city and had some near immediate clues that my lungs weren't happy, slight small little pains or temp tightness.... saw an ENT and he said respiratory allergies without being specific and gave me a steroid inhaler and some asthma tabs. took those for a few days after a partic bad tightness episode, I went to see a pulmonologist and he checked me out and said I might have early COPD though without doing a PFT.... put me on celestone, took me off ENT's drugs, a powerful gargling mouth wash as I had a super sore throat esp on one side, an expectorant and antibiotics just in case. the expectorant cleared lungs in about 2 days but inflamed throat like crazy... left city again and some improvement in symptoms tho went to NY and Phila so although like mountain air compared to home I was still sensitive to irritants.. perfume I noted started getting me bad, tightness for an hour or two after slightly prolonged exposure. since back I'm now on Zenhale 200/5 2x2 day which I feel helps a bit but it's not a super help. some wheezing, maybe 2 or 3 times. mucus is a minor issue now, very minor. cough, none to speak of apart from once or twice every couple of days.... chest tightness for an hour or two following perfume is most noticeable thing.... no idea qwith smoke as I run a mile if someones smoking.... day I got back from NY phila trip woke up with some SOB and was a bit panicky, took inhaler and celestone and within an hour or so I was ok.... COPD forums have told me generally that allergies and/or asthma sounds most likely?? and told me to go away in nice terms... what do you think? any and all comments appreciated.

92	Child with asthma sick for weeks at a time	Hello, I am looking for input/experiences from other parents of children with the same type of things going on. My youngest daughter who just turned 3 has just recently had dr say she believes she has asthma as she has had a nighttime cough since she was little and it has now progressed to her always being sick with a cough, wheezing , you can hear the cackling in her chest when she breathes and exhales loudly at end of each breath when it's really bad . However we have some over and over the albuteral treatments with nebulizer machine and we do a round of liquid steroids every time and usually it gets better after couple weeks but few days later it starts again . She has now basically been sick for like 4 months at her last appt for this episode they again said start albuteral , take Zyrtec at night, round of steroids and also started her Week ago on a daily dose of singular .. This is being none of this has given her much relief and I am worried it's not even asthma at this point and maybe something more serious ?? I don't know , she has appt with a pulmonologist / allergist on June 18th but I am getting so frustrated and worried we are giving her these meds for no reason since they don't totally fix anything and she hardly gets a break .. If anyone has similar experiences etc please share with me if this is normal and she just had a bad case of asthma but I just feel like something isn't right not sure if meds are wrong or a whole other issue going on. Also she just recently had full blood work and blood allergy testing done and that all came back clear ..

93	Joint Pain, swollen and redness of joints	Since 17 years old the cartialidge around my rib cage has been on and off inflamed. At 22 this problem spread all over my body, including fatigue. My doctor was certain it was RA. Now 23, this sickness continues to get worse making life almost impossible to live and some days I have to be in bed most of the day because of some activity I did prior. I am on an NSAID, which has stopped helping me as much as it once did. I cannot do any activity with out feeling Pain, being swollen, and feeling tired! I was shocked when my blood results came back and my sed rate was normal. This left me feeling very confused. I can see the redness, see my joints swollen, and I can feel the pain. It is in my hands, wrists, knees, ankles, rib cage, spine and hips. This pain is something I feel every single day, and usually about 4 joints a day will hurt but they are somewhere different with each day. Also, with this usually when I feel fatigue, my eyes get hot and sometimes burn, my doctor couldn't help me with that one. I am wondering if somehow my immune system is invloved when I feel that way, when fatigued, I am often imobalized. My question is, since my sed rate came back normal, should I rule out arthirtis altogether? Some family members are insistent that it is fybro.

94	Arthritis Pain	When I am active my joint pain goes away. When I get up in the morning and after sitting for more than 30 minutes, I am very stiff and have pain in my ankles, knees and back. I can walk it off in about 10 minutes. If I do heavy work or some running with my dogs I am ok, but at night in bed my hips keep my awake. Alive or asperin help. I am 56 years old male. Is this some kind of arthritis ?

96	Pain in knees and I get swelling above my knees	Hi, looking for any advice if possible. I get swelling above my knees sometimes when my knees hurt but usually about an hour after I've been exercising. I also get a lot of sharp pains in both my knees shooting downwards in the morning and evening. There is not extreme swelling but there is plenty of liquid there. My knees stay slightly purple most of the time and my joints go stiff when sitting. I have actually been to the doctors but he didn't look at my legs... I was sat on a chair, he straightened my leg out and obviously it isn't the most comfortable position so he saw it was tender and referred me to physio. I start my physio in 2 weeks and I'm worried they're not going to see any issues or make it worse, because the swelling is not immediate. My nan, mum and sister all have arthritis, my mum and sisters are in the knees so I'm quite concerned this is never going to be addressed. Any advice on what I should do would be greatly appreciated.

97	Joint Pain with fever	My husband is suffering from Joint pain in his both feet with stiffness in neck from last 2 months. Firstly, there was swelling in his right foot with pain. We visited a rheumatologist and she recommended Diclofenac. The swelling vanished. But the pain was still there. By the time, he was also having continuous fevers. Doctor had done all type of tests for inflammatory arthritis and his HLA B27 test came positive. After some time when there was no improvement in pain, she recommended him Prednisone 40 mg. But that made my husband's condition even worse. After that he got swelling in his right knee. So we stopped taking prednisone afetr taking it for 3 days. Swelling got reduced. Doctor has done all type of tests but she is not able to get the reason for fever. She says fever doesn't occur in any inflammatory arthritis. My husband's father is also suffering from Ankylosing Spondilytis, so it makes us feel the same for my husband too but doctor rules out this option as she says fever doesn't occur in this condition. So, we are not able to understand whether its an Ankylosing Spondilytis or any type of inflammatory arthritis or not. He is not having any back pains. Is anybody having same kind of problems? We are not able to understand what to do next.

98	chronic back pain - tried everything and desperate for help	My wife has had chronic, sharp, burning upper back pain since giving birth ten months ago. It is in a very specific area a few inches to the right of her spine. It has gotten bad enough that on some days she can't even pick up our baby. Even a light touch to the area makes her wince in pain. She already has tried: - blood test for rheumatologic disorder (negative) - MRI (twice) - negative - Xray - negative - chiropractor (completed 12 visits, only made it worse) - physical therapist (completed 15 visits, only made it worse) - lidocaine injections - no help - lidocaine patches - no help - general practice doctor - said he gave up, no more ideas Can anyone make any suggestions?

99	Headache, Fatigue and ongoing upper left back ache?	Hey, This is my first time doing one of these health forums, but I thought it might help my own anxiety since I've already visited so many doctors in the past 6 months with multiple issues. I started to have health anxiety around July of last year, and since then I've done much better, but I still suffer from certain issues that I thought maybe asking other people could ease my worries and concerns. Starting with the more recent issues, I had a horrible headache the whole day yesterday that only slightly was relieved with advil. I thought it was stress or maybe I wasn't drinking enough water, but I woke up today with the same headache, a little less severe, but still frustrating and concerning. I don't really like taking too many advils or over the counter NSAIDS, and I don't want to keep taking them just to relieve some of the pressure. I did the worst thing you can do with health anxiety and looked online (ugh) and of course, that always makes every little symptom = cancer or some other disease. With the headaches I also have awful fatigue in the morning, even though I am getting 7-8 hours of sleep. I do have a bad habit of going to sleep around midnight, but I usually don't have problems falling asleep. The other issue that I've had since this past december is this weird, achey/strain I feel from my upper left ribcage (right below my breast) that fluctuates to the upper left back area right under the left shoulder blade. Some days its more worse than others, and it often comes and goes. Usually I feel it in the morning and not as often later in the day. I was quite concerned about it at first in December, but since then I've talked to my doctor about it, done blood tests (everything was fine), did an ultrasound (also fine) and it's still there. One thing I've noticed is that it hurts more after some sort of exercise, whether it be some sort of cardio or just yoga. I also noticed it really bothers me consistently the day after a night out of drinking (this is the worst it usually is since it stays the whole day). At this point, I'm more annoyed and frustrated with it more than anything, but unfortunately haven't gotten any answers from the multiple doctor visits I've had (cardiologist and primary doctor). The pain isn't severe, but it's almost as if I need to keep stretching because it feels like I pulled a muscle that just won't go away. Sorry for the long post...If you read all that I really appreciate it as I've been trying to reduce my health anxiety, but these constant symptoms, especially the upper back/upper abdominal strain doesn't help my worries. I do take Clonazepam (.5mg) and Prozoac (20 mg) and am a 22 year old female. Any advice is seriously appreciated! Thank you.

100	I Can't Sit due to left lower back pain (Page 1)	I have pain in my left lower back that is aggravated by sitting (this is a real problem as I have 4 hours of intense class for 4 hours every morning.). It is relieved by standing and lying down. While on my back if I try to stretch my right hamstring I get the pain. I can never seem to stretch the muscle and I don't get relief from muscle relaxers, nsaids, lidocaine patches, and only mild relief with vicodin. I am starting to do phsyioball and core exercises and have noticed that when I contract my glutes the pain is relieved. Sound familiar to anyone?

101	Skin discoloring, burning sensation and stabbing pain on my back	I have a large brown discoloration oon my mid back. Almost every day i experience some degree of stabbing pain (like being stabbed with needles), itchiness, and burning sensations. Sometimes bengay and rest can alleviate the symptoms, but it still comes back on an almost daily basis. I have a photo of the discoloration for reference.

103	Small but painful insect bite	I hope this is the right place for this question. I have been bitten/stung twice now while in my back yard. I have a cedar deck and was walking across it and something bit/stung me in my calf (both times). They also bit/stung a dog I was watching once. The bug is quite small and I didn't even see it when it bit/stung the dog, nor the second time I was hit. I can sometimes see them flying around when the sun hits just right and they appear to be reddish/brownish and maybe half the size of a house fly. The bite/sting is quite painful and swells reddish for a few inches in diameter with a smaller yellowish swelling of about 1 inch in diameter, then a small red dot in the middle. The pain gradually subsides over a few hours, along with the swelling. It does not itch at all. The question is, what bit me? The follow up question is, how to I get rid of them?

110	11 month old daughter had bacterial meningitis	I am lost as to what to do and could really use some advice. My oldest daughter contracted bacterial meningitis at 11 months old. Her pediatrician at the time was a family friend that I trusted. I was 18 and had no idea of what could be wrong. She was running a high fever for about two days and was lathargic didn't want to eat or drink. I called the Dr. and they squeezed her in at the end of the day with her Dr. We got there and they were just thinking that is was a urinary track infection so they wanted a urine sample. It took forever to get one since she did not want to drink and what they did get was not very much. They took it and came back and gave me a perscription for an antibiotic and sent us home. My husband worked nights so I took her home and had her lying in bed next to me when I realized that she was starting to have a seizure. I called 911 they rushed her to the hospital. The ER Dr instantly had a feeling that it was meningitis so instantly took a spinal. As she withdrew the fluid it came out almost milky white and on top of that she did not move or cry when they did the spinal tap. They admitted her to the picu and she got worse everyday! she became septic, her kidneys were shutting down and things were not looking good. Finally she took a turn for the better and slowly got moved out in the regular pediatric floor. She was there with a pic line for two weeks or so. When they figured out what strain it was and got her on the right antibiotic she was getting better. When the time came that they decided she was ok to come home they ran all the standard tests on her to see if there was any damage. She had lost her hearing (nerve) in her left ear, but the right seemed to be still normal. I know that the Dr. had misdiagnosed her and I was so upset with it, but because he was a family friend we did not file malpractice. Here we are 10 years later, we have found out that she had a stroke during that time. Her right ear has been fine but when I took her in for her annual hearing test they told me she was having some mild hearing loss in her good ear, and that it is probably going to start fading. I know we can put a hearing aid in that ear and there is this thing called the bone anchored hearing implant they can do for her left. I know this is what we have to do for her, but the costs are going to kill us and who knows what else we are going to have to pay out of pocket for. I am not a real believer in suing and because he was a family friend and I had grown up with his kids we did not file a malpractice claim. I am just having a hard time forgiving myself for not doing that for her so that she could have the means if needed. And I am told now that it is too late to do anything now. I am trying to be strong for her, but at the same time I am so angry and upset and sad. I just wish there was something we could still do to send a message to that Dr. that rushing us out of his office almost cost us our daughter. And he just walked away without a slap on the hand.

111	Just tell me, could I have meningitis?	I have been having the strangest symptoms for 8 week straight now: headaches, pressure in head when bending over (not when coughing/sneezing/lifting), headaches in one spot when standing up, dizziness, smell phantom smoke smells, nausea, fatigue, big white floaters in both eyes, ringing ears, strange sore throat. It all started when I accidentally had rain water (we are on a farm, its stored in tanks fed from a roof) forced up my nose. Its winter here btw. Now I know I am anxious about it being a form of meningitis. With these symptoms I can't help it. I've gathered its too long to be Naegleria fowleri but now I wonder what other form I could have. TB? But out of 4 doctors GPs, 4 visits to the ERs and a neuro I consulted there, none even contemplated my symptoms linked to the water, let alone it being meningitis, when I posed the question. Can someone smart tell me, is it possible to have any form of meningitis after 8 weeks of ongoing symptoms from water up the nose? OK, I know anything is possible but .... In my understanding I would be the first person recorded to get any form of meningitis from water this way after 8 weeks from exposure and constant symptoms. I should be dead by now. After so many tests done (MRI, CT, blood, eye exams) which are all clear, this must all be in my head, which is fine by me!!
