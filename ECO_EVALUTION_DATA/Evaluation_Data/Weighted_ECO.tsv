I went searching for the answer and found the following information: Ask Dr. Mark Babyatsky What 's the Difference Between Acid Reflux and GERD? Q: Is there a difference between acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)? I have been reading about GERD, and the term ``acid reflux '' comes up a lot. Are they the same thing? -- Janis, New York A: Acid reflux simply means that acid made by your stomach's cells backs up through the lower esophageal junction (where your esophagus and stomach meet). At low levels, acid reflux is a normal part of digestion and movement along the gastrointestinal tract. In normal patients, acid reflux can cause symptoms such as heartburn, but it is not considered to be a disease. Avoiding foods that trigger acid reflux, such as fatty foods, coffee, chocolate, etc, will help relieve any symptoms it causes. GERD, on the other hand, is characterized by an abnormal frequency or amount of reflux. It can result in heartburn, hoarseness, chest pain, and, rarely, asthma, and may be associated with Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. The bottom line: Acid reflux is the backing up of stomach acid, while GERD is a disease state of which acid reflux is part..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Acid Reflux

It is very commonly found in people who are 55 or older. Accidents, sports injuries, fractures are also common causes of osteoarthritis. Doctors always recommend NSAIDs instead of acetaninophen. These may include aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen. Some natural supplements are also there which include glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate.######No, that would be rheumatoid arthritis which is often accompanied by osteoarthritis; the wearing out or damage of a joint. Anyways, OptiMSM has worked well to relieve pain because it helps strengthen the joint.######Hi Cindy, One of the best things you can do for your knees is to keep a normal weight and to exercise and keep yourself strong. You should count yourself among the lucky ones that it took an xray to discover it and not daily increasing pain. It may never amount to much-your injury will heal and you will be fine. In the future, if your knees or other joints become painful, I would suggest you see a rheumatologist to manage your treatment instead of just your GP.

Carpal tunnel syndrome describes a condition generally known as a peripheral entrapment neuropathy. Specifically, the neurological pathology is caused because the median nerve (the peripheral nerve which goes from the hand to the arm) gets squeezed (â$ entrappedâ$) at the wrist. Among other things, the median nerve controls sensory information sensations from the palm side of the thumb and fingers (not the little finger). The nerve passes through the carpal tunnel. This is a canal formed between wrist bones and the ligaments that hold them together. The canal forms a passageway for the median nerve, the tendons of the flexor muscles of the hand. The entrapment occurs because sometimes the tendons and other tissues thicken. This narrows the carpal tunnel causing the median nerve to be compressed. The result of this squeezing is manifested differently in different people. It may result in pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, and sometimes these sensations radiate up the arm. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME? It is extremely rare for the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome to begin quickly. Instead, the symptoms generally start gradually. The person feels sensations like tingling, burning or itching numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers. It is especially pronounced in the thumb, index and middle fingers. Often, the fingers feel swollen, even though they are not. These sensations can occur in one or both hands simultaneously. It is most common for the symptoms to first appear at night. Many people report waking up and having to wring or â$ shake outâ$ their hands. If symptoms worsen, the sensations last into the day, generally with tingling. As the condition progress further, the person might feel a decrease in grip strength. It becomes difficult to make a fist or grasp small objects. In severe and chronic cases that re untreated, there is wasting of the muscles at the base of the thumb and people lose sensation of hot and cold. You can do 3 simple tests which are consistent with a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (but, for course, are not necessarily definitive tests). If you answer yes to any of these tests, then you may have carpal tunnel syndrome. 1. Phalen Maneuver Flex your wrist gently and as far as possible (i.e., bring your fingers as close to your wrist as you can). Then hold this position for 1 minute. Do your symptoms- especially numbness- appear or get worse? 2. Tinel Test With your hand straight, lightly tap the skin over the crease in your wrist. Does it result in a tingling or â$ pins-and-needlesâ$ in the hand? 3. Durkan Test With your hand straight, apply firm pressure to the wrist crease for 30 seconds. Relax for one minute, and then apply firm pressure to the palm (just past the wrist crease) for 30 seconds. Do either of these make your symptoms (especially numbness) appear or get worse? HOW IS CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME TREATED? Carpal tunnel syndrome is not something you just get rid of with drugs, shots, or surgery. You merely suppress the symptoms because the underlying cause is both anatomical and physiological. We do n't know why it rears its head when it does, although some believe repetitive strain brings it on, but more research is needed to be sure. The traditional treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome attempt to relieve pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. However, no single treatment choice is right for every person. The factors to consider for treatment depend on 1) How severe the symptoms are and what 's causing them, 2) How long the symptoms have been felt, and 3) How much the symptoms affect the personâ$ s life (at work and home). Once diagnosed, treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome should begin as early as possible, under a doctor's direction. The underlying causes (such as diabetes or arthritis) should be treated first. An initial treatment generally involves resting the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks. This means avoiding activities that may worsen symptoms, and immobilizing the wrist in a splint or brace to avoid further damage from twisting or bending. Cold packs are used if there is inflammation in order to help reduce swelling. Carpal tunnel syndrome treatments fall into two general categories: surgical and nonsurgical. Both have potential risks and benefits. NON-SURGICAL TREATMENTS Most people with carpal tunnel syndrome should at give nonsurgical treatments a try. These treatments work best below the age of 50 and if the symptoms are mild to moderate, not constant and began less than 10 months prior to evaluation. The great advantage of nonsurgical techniques for carpal tunnels syndrome it that they are less invasive than surgery and most people obtain at least short-term relief from one or a combination of nonsurgical treatments. The great disadvantage of nonsurgical techniques for carpal tunnels syndrome is that they usually are effective only in cases of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. They may not provide permanent symptomatic relief especially for advanced cases. Also, nonsurgical treatments may lead a person to postpone an operation that is inevitable. If too much time elapses before deciding on surgery, it may reduce the chance of a completely successful operation. Activity modification For most people, the position of the wrist position is vital to controlling the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. The more the wrist is bent, the more pressure is put on the median nerve. Therefore, precautions to take in order to protect oneâ$ s hands include: Reduce wrist bending. Avoid bending the wrist all the way up or down. Relaxing grip. Avoid gripping too hard when driving, writing or using hand tools. Most people use more force than necessary when doing hand tasks. Choose tools wisely. When writing, use a thick pen with an oversized, soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink. Modify hand tools such as going from a straight handle to a pistol grip. Avoid vibrating tools. Take breaks. When performing activities that require repetitive, forceful motion with wrists bent, stop every 15 to 20 minutes and gently stretch and bend the hands and fingers. Use proper posture. Poor posture causes the shoulders to roll forward, shortening the neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in the neck. Keep hands warm. Pain and stiffness are more likely to occur if hands are cold. Splints Splints (braces) are the most commonly used non-drug treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome. These immobilize the wrist in a neutral position and most people use them during sleep. They are generally effective to varying degrees Active medical devices The Carpal Therapist is a relatively new device and is unique in that it is an electrically powered massaging device. It combines the immobility features of the brace with active therapeutic massaging as from a physical therapist. Electrical motors in the brace massage the tendons of the wrist, stretching the tendons and reducing swelling in the carpal tunnel. The Carpal Solution is a device very much related to a brace in its concept and to some extent, its function. This reportedly causes stretching and re-shaping of the wristâ$ s anatomy using a three pronged tape system. WristTrac is another device targeted for carpal tunnel syndrome. This device is a brace with a built in stretching mechanism and reportedly results in stretching of the forearm tendons in a manner similar to traction. Physical therapy When the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are mild to moderate, physical therapy or special hand exercises can be used for relief. There are certain exercises that can be used which include gliding exercises to help relieve carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms, and when used in combination with other treatments, such as splinting, they appear to be more beneficial. Ultrasound and contrast baths are said to provide short term relief, but may not be very effective in more severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. Drugs The most common treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is symptomatic relief using drugs. Drugs can ease the associated pain and swelling, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen. Diuretic pills (``water pills '') can decrease swelling and may offer pain relief. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) or the lidocaine can be injected directly into the wrist or taken by mouth (in the case of prednisone) to relieve pressure on the median nerve and provide immediate, temporary relief to those with mild or intermittent symptoms. This is also true of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplements. However, persons with diabetes and those who may be predisposed to diabetes should note that prolonged use of corticosteroids can make it difficult to regulate insulin levels. Exercise In situations where symptoms are not too severe, stretching and strengthening exercises can be beneficial. These exercises should be supervised by a doctor or physical therapist. Additionally, an occupational therapist may be sought because they are trained in evaluating people with physical impairments and helping them build skills to improve their health and well-being. SURGICAL TREATMENTS One of the most common surgical procedures in the United States is carpal tunnel release. This is generally recommended if carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms last for 6 months. The surgery involves severing the band of tissue around the wrist to reduce pressure on the median nerve. The following are types of carpal tunnel release surgery: Open release surgery, is the traditional procedure used to correct carpal tunnel syndrome. This consists of making an incision up to 2 inches in the wrist and then cutting the carpal ligament to enlarge the carpal tunnel. Endoscopic surgery is far less traumatic and allows for faster functional recovery and less postoperative discomfort than traditional open release surgery. Either two or one (double portal or single portal carpal tunnel surgery, respectively) tiny incisions are made in the wrist and palm. A camera and surgical instruments are inserted in the incisions in order to cut the carpal ligament. Full recovery from carpal tunnel surgery can take days to months, although symptoms may be relieved immediately afterward. Additional results in some patients may be infection, nerve damage, stiffness, and pain at the scar. Occasionally the wrist loses strength because the carpal ligament is cut. Recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome following treatment is not uncommon. However, the majority of patients recover completely..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

I have a fair complexion and do not stay out in the sun. But I have had skin cancer before, years ago. I think this is the third time I have gotten it. My skin cancer is pink colored and perhaps a little flaky. It 's only a small one of about 3/16 '' round shaped and is on my forearm. I have read that there are basically three types of skin cancer. But there are other names under those three common types. According to what I saw from looking at various pictures of skin cancers, it looks like actinic keratoses. But a description of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) sounds like that could also be a possibility. But mine is real light colored and looks pinkish like the photo I saw of actinic keratoses. I hate to go to doctors and I think this can be treated with drugs since I have used them in the past for skin cancer. I do n't remember the name of the med I used then. It was prescription. I think it was like a white cream that you just rub into the skin. Has anyone used any natural remedies? Not sure if I would depend on something natural like. Maybe my primary care physician can identify it and give me a script, but I would rather avoid seeing a doctor unless it is absolutely necessary. Thanks. Bluehills######You may wish to go to the doctor. You did n't mention what kind of skin cancer you had in the past. In general, there is Basal Cell (harmless) Squamous Cell (can be fatal) Melanoma (always fatal if ignored). There is a rare pink skin cancer, Amelanotic Melanoma that is usually more agressive than the standard darker Melanoma. Efudex 5 &#37; is by rx and is a chemotherapy cream that has been shown to help with small basal cell or squamous cell or residual cancer cells after excission.######djoyv I remember a skin cancer I had probably 15-20 years ago that was about a half inch round, very crusty and it would bleed ocassionally. But I do n't remember the exact name of it. The doctor back then actually cut the thing off my arm. Maybe old technic these days. My second skin cancer I used a cream on it. And I bet it was Efudex 5%. Since I 'm not a doctor it would be premature for me to say it is actinic keratoses, but the pic I saw of it looks exactly like it in early stage. I have a few freckles on my arm and it almost looks like a big freckle but more pinkish in color. It 's almost hard to see really. Thanks for mentioning the Efudex 5% to me. For now I am not in any hurry to have anything done with it. I 'll be keeping an eye on it though to see if it changes in any way. I know some skin cancer can kill. I do see a doctor in 3 weeks. I might have them take a look at it. Thanks..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

The scar has healed, and my dermatologist prescribed Aldara cream to be applied daily for about 3 weeks to a large area on my scalp where there are several actinic keratoses visible (she biopsied them). After 8 hours I wash it off. My concern is about the side effects I keep reading about Aldara. I 've used it for 2 nights in a row now and am already feeling flu like symptoms and have noticed that my occipital lymph node is swollen and tender. Other than some slight itching, I 'm not having much reaction at the site of application. Could the other symptoms be related to the Aldara or have I just been reading too much on the internet?######Hi! Flu-like symptoms, together with headache and muscle pain, are rare side effects while using Aldara. More common are mild local skin reactions such as itching, peeling, burning, rush, pain, erosion and edema at the site of application or surrounding areas. If you experience a severe skin reaction like erosion, you should wash it off and notified your doctor. I 'll suggest you to inform your doctor and ask to decrease the application, because some trials showed that the side effects were more common and more intense with daily use rather than 3 times a week. All best to you!######Thanks for your response. My dermatologist did cut me back to 3 applications per week. I 'm still having the swollen lymph nodes in my neck, but they are worst the day after application. Anyway, she wanted me to continue and said that my body was responding as it should, so I 'll tough it out a couple more weeks!######Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) can be seen in 5% of patients during 6 weeks treatment with Aldara. This sign, together with flu-like symptoms, can be a enough reason to make an interruption of dosing. You should know that you can develop treatment site infection, which can be also reason for swollen lymph nodes. This, also, requires a rest period and antibiotics can be taken. After the interruption or rest period you can continue with your treatment and still have good results from the treatment. You can ask your doctor about the rest period. Please, write me back!######I did see my dermatologist 1 week ago and she seemed pleased with the way the aldara is working. There does n't seem to be any sign of infection at the site of application, (no real pain or swelling) and the flu-like symptoms do n't seem to be quite as severe since I 'm only applying the medication 3 times a week now. I have one week to go, so am hoping that it will all be over soon. I 'll see the doctor again on the 19th for a follow-up. Thanks again for your information! Amy######I had a biopsy yesterday. I was just wondering whaththe aldara is used for.######Aldara is used to treat Actinic Keratosis, Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma and External Genital and Perianal Warts. Have you been suspected for skin cancer? Did you receive your biopsy results?######I 'm happy your feeling much better. Hope you 'll have good results with the treatment. Please, keep me up dated about your condition! All best to you!######I 've been on Aldara for 4 weeks now, 5 days a week with a 2 day rest period. I have BCC on my left cheek and as soon as I start using the Aldara on the site the next morning my lymph node on my left side swells up like a grape and is like that for the duration of the 5 days treatment. Some days I am slightly feverish and achey and quite tired. My cheek looks like something out of a horror film and this skin has scabbed and shed twice, this is my third round of skin growing. The area is very red and swollen, I only hope it does n't leave a scar or that the redness fades away rather than looking like a baboons bottom during mating season. My face has a little indentation, like a crater, hope this heals up. I 'm really fair skinned and never go in the sun which surprises me how I got this in the first place, mind you I live in New Zealand where we have an extremely high rate of skin cancer. All I know is that I 'm glad to become cancer free without stitches and extensive scarring from surgery.######I 'm 44 and had my first skin cancer at 24. Mohs the first time and I HATE MOHS. It always leaves a scar. I 've had many different sites with skin cancer since, but none as bad as the first. I 'm using Aldara as a preventive on my face right now and efudex on my arms. Efudex on your face is really bad, but on the arms not a big deal. Stick with the Aldara. It ca n't be that bad. Plus Aldara and Efudex actually make your skin look better either way.######It IS that bad. I have been using Aldara on my face 2x/week for 8 weeks (plus two weeks off at the third and fifth week's end-- just could n't take it anymore). I look like a burn victim. I have bright red, crusty lesions on my forehead, all around my nose, and above my upper lip. The areas are painful, itchy, and stinging. I feel under the weather (mildly flu-ish) the entire time I 'm on this stuff. I hate Aldara, but I 'm sticking with it because my doctor assures me it is the best way to treat AK without scarring. This is the second time I 've used it, however, and one area near my nose continues to react, so I will need a biopsy there regardless..######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

Is anyone having some experience with that, and can you give me some advices?######Cowboy Jim, I had the Mohs procedure done a few weeks ago on my scalp. It was to remove a squamous cell carcinoma. My GP referred me to Dr. Christine Brown in Dallas. She is located right across from Baylor Hospital near downtown. I 've felt confident with her and am now following up with Aldara cream to treat the actinic keratoses that are also on my scalp. I was assured that the Mohs procedure was the best way to be sure all the cancer was removed since my SCC was considered deep tissue. Anyway, Dr. Brown has a website that is very imformative.

And the best prevention is knowledge. A proper knowledge about the ailment we discussing here is even more important. Skin cancer is categorized as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The malignant form of the cancer is particularly dangerous as it can proliferate into other parts of the body. Most forms of skin cancer are not fatal if treated early. Skin cancer is increasing at an alarming rate. Popularity of suntan and increased U-V radiation is the number one cause. Increased use of pesticides in agriculture, carcinogenic agents like Benzene, and junk foods all contribute in varying degree to this increase of skin cancer. Any further information about skin cancer will be appreciated.

Or, something else:! : i do not have acne on my face except for the rare pimple (which heals quickly), so its rather noticable when I have a new mark on my face. These unidentified ``sores '' on my face started out as what appeared to be little pimples filled with pus. They are not clustered together, but appear sparsely on my face. (about 8- 10 in total) they took a while to heal. Upon healing, they have left ever-so-slight scarring. On a fairly regular basis, on * exactly * the same spot as the scarring, they appear again, not usually all of them at once however. They first become a little red and slightly pronounced. If squeezed, a small amount of pus comes out. These little sores then dry-up and take longer than normal pimples to heal. There is a continuous slight peeling of the scar/skin on at least one of these healed sores. This entire process repeats itself. I very occasionally get what I know to be cold sores on the corners of my mouth. But since these little sores started six months ago I have n't had a cold sore on the corners of my mouth! I * think * these sores respond well to zovirax cream, which would indicate that they are cold sores, but I ca n't be sure. What on god's earth are they !? :? :######: oo ps hi nazz, you wo n't beleive it but I have been suffering from the exact same problem as you it seems. I have tried everything and to no avail. I had up to about a year ago blemish free skin, but noticed that I was starting to get random marks that flared up almost overnight on the right hand side of my mouth. Some would have a little pus, some would disappear quickly only to come back later with no apparent reason. The top of the pimple was flaky, and they have left light scars under the skin. I have not had pain with them, but if I touch (or pick!) one then the skin goes very red very quickly and the spot immediately gets bigger. . Almost like blood vessels have broken under the skin. They are not sore, but very unsightly and as soon as one seems to go another turns up... All around the mouth and chin area. I am going nuts about this as my diet is healthy, I have tried every cream known to man and no success... Please can anyone suggest anything? Ps I also have a very dry and cracked lower lip, but this may not be related######1. WHAT CAUSES SKIN CANCER? The association of sun exposure with skin cancer is well established. People with lighter skin (especially those who do n't tan) are more susceptible to skin cancer. Skin wrinkling and skin cancer relate to total sun exposure over one's entire life. 2. WO N'T I HAVE EARLY WARNING SIGNS? Even patients who never sunbathe receive thousands of hours of lifetime exposure. Unfortunately, when the total dosage reaches a critical point, patients start noticing precancerous and cancerous lesions. These may appear in large numbers and at frequent intervals. A patient may have had smooth skin until age 30, 40, or 50 and suddenly begins to develop precancerous or cancerous lesions several times a year. They can not undo the sun damage now. They can decrease further radiation damage by wearing sunscreen lotions regularly. This will not, however, keep radiation damage at zero. Patients will even develop lesions in winter. X-ray treatment in the past also predisposes to skin cancer. We should know of any such previous treatment. 3. WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF SKIN CANCER? Basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in the United States. Approximately 500,000 new cases occur each year. We treat this kind of skin cancer many times daily in our office. It usually appears as a pimple-like spot that does not seem to go away. Almost all patients thought it was a pimple at first. They tend to pick at it, believing this is the reason the lesion persists. Any pimple should be gone within 1-2 months. If a pimple is still on the face after a 2 month period, make sure we check it. This cancer does not usually metastasize (one study reported one in 3000 spread to other organs) and, therefore, it is rarely fatal, except in persons who neglect it. It does grow locally in the area in which it develops with the potential of destroying adjacent structures (for example nose, cheek, eyelid, etc.) and must, therefore, be treated to prevent this. 4. HOW IS BASAL CELL CARCINOMA TREATED? I use surgical excision with suturing, laser excision, or curettage and electrodesiccation (using a sharp surgical curette to remove the tumor and for biopsy while making sure the entire tumor is gone, and subsequent burning with an electric needle). I find cure rates with any of these methods to be well over 95%. The surgical procedures described above should be completely painless, with the patient feeling only the slightest prick with a local anesthetic. Another method reserved for the most difficult skin cancers, in my opinion, is called Moh's chemosurgery. This method may leave larger defects that can take a significant period of time to heal. It is, therefore, not usually my initial therapeutic choice. This method involves taking small pieces of skin and checking them to ensure complete removal of a large tumor or difficult recurrent tumors. We may occasionally use cryosurgery (freezing) or x-ray to treat some skin cancers. In some carcinomas, large size or difficult location may lead me to suggest that our plastic surgeon excise the cancer. This would be recommended if indicated; however, most lesions can be treated quite simply in the office. 5. WHAT IS APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-UP CARE FOR EARLY DETECTION AND TREATMENT? Patients who have had a skin cancer will be prone for life to develop others, just as a patient with cavities will be so predisposed. Studies have shown a 35-50% incidence of an additional skin cancer (basal and squa-mous cell types) within 3 years after treatment of the first cancer. A small percentage of cases may recur but are usually detected at an early stage when patients are followed routinely. Every 3 months (for 1 year) after removal of any cancer and every 6 months lifelong are current recommendations. Patients who follow this routine rarely have significant problems because lesions are found when they are small. Some areas, such as the forehead and nose, may develop several skin cancers. Former President Reagan developed one skin cancer on his nose and had another one develop on the nose shortly thereafter, and a recurrence, according to reports. This is another reason for frequent lifetime check-ups by any patient having basal cell carcinoma. 6. WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR? The face, neck, tops of the hands and arms are most frequently exposed to ultraviolet light from the sun. 90% of all skin cancers (except melanoma) occur in these areas. These are the areas that patients should watch most carefully, although all skin should be checked monthly at home. The following signs of skin cancer (basal and squamous cell) should be closely looked for: 1. An open sore or pimple that bleeds, oozes or crusts and remains for one month or more. A persistent nonhealing pimple should be checked. Almost all patients (including former President Reagan) call skin cancer a pimple that they usually pick at. They invariably think this is the reason it is still present. 2. A reddish patch or irritated area, especially on sun exposed skin. It may or may not be symptomatic. Most skin cancers do not cause the patient any discomfort. Many skin cancers will also never bleed. 3. A shiny bump that can be a pearly color or pinkish-red color. 7. WHAT ARE PRE-CANCERS AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA? Actinic keratoses (pre-cancers) usually present as small reddish patches that may have a slight brownish tinge. They may be slightly scaly and occasionally bleed. One usually notices it as a small patch that will scale or is rough and looks slightly different than the surrounding skin. One key in differentiating this from a benign area is that these areas will still be there one or two months later. Any persistently different area of skin should be checked by a dermatologist. These keratoses will lead to a somewhat more difficult skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, if not treated. They usually grow slowly and may take several years before turning into a squamous cell carcinoma; however, patients should not delay in treatment, as some may develop into squamous cell carcinoma rather rapidly. Although squamous cell carcinoma of the sun-exposed skin does not frequently spread to other organs (metastasize), this is possible (approximately 5-10% reported in different studies) and, therefore, should be treated early. As these develop into squamous cell carcinoma, the scale may become thicker and the lesion may grow deeper. These premalignant keratoses can be easily treated with superficial therapy, such as freezing with liquid nitrogen. This causes a scab or blister and heals usually within 1 or 2 weeks. This method removes the diseased top layer of the skin. Presidents Clinton and Bush have had several actinic keratoses treated with this method. A topical chemical, 5-fluorouracil, may be used, but may cause too much irritation of the skin for some patients. It is used mostly for patients with large numbers of actinic keratoses. Although actinic keratoses are precursors of squa-mous cell carcinoma and therefore can be detected in a premalignant phase, basal cell carcinoma does not have any precursor lesion. Basal cell carcinoma develops from the very beginning as a basal cell carcinoma.######I have had the same issue for about 6 months also! Never had blemishes before this, scares the hell out of me and makes me feel very alone and confused... I also have had a dry and cracked lower lip######did psoriasin ointment. worked!######Its a fungal infection. Try an over the counter anti fungal ringworm cream will do. Should respond ASAP######Sounds like Millia to me... I had something similar. I read this blog and it usually is SUPER informative. Plus, if you ca n't find the answer on the site, the dermatologist will answer your questions if you submit them. Good luck!######Hi there! My suggestion is to talk to your pharmacist, that is what I do when I have problems such as this and they are very helpful! Good luck!######I have the same scourge on my face as you both described. When one area clears, another pops up. I get really stressed about it. I never had pimples as a young woman. Now i 'm aging and should be worried about wrinkles but I have these sores, usually one, sometimes two but they are gross, larger than a pimple, and take a long time to heal. I suppose they could be cold sores... I 've even had one on my forehead. They are red and angry looking. When I attempt to pick one of the plugs out, it bleeds a lot. I try not to touch them b/c i 'm sure it makes them worse but sometimes I take off the dead skin and even that will sometimes draw blood, just a small pin point area that will bleed a long time. I 've seen many dermatologists about it, they all give me the ``drive-through '' visit, and put me on antibiotics which do n't help. I even saw 2 dermatologists at johns hopkins who did nothing but say I was self inflicting. I would never pick my face like this, I even asked them to do a scraping and they refused. They could n't get me out of their office fast enough. If you get a proper diagnosis, please share it and I will do the same.######I 'm 31 and all my life my skin has been ok. I 'd occassionally get a pimple, but nothing like this. Mine are mainly on my chin, but i 've had them other places. They are so hard! Sometimes there will be a little yellow head, but if I do try to pop it it just bleeds and a little pus comes out. Have any of you had them on your chin or around your mouth? It seems if I push my tounge inside my mouth behind where the bump is, it feels inflamed on the inside. I am so frustrated!############But unlike a cold sore they are smaller (pimple like) and do n't blister like a cold sore. They also dont pop like a normal pimple and although it looks like you could squeeze the white out of the middle, very little comes out and they just turn very red like you 've broken a blood vessle trying to sqeeze them... Very bizarre and I have been freaking out trying to figure out if it 's herpes or not that is crawling down my chin and above my upper lip. I recently had oral sex with a girl i 've been dating briefly so I wonder what else it could be ?? yeast? a rash? Any thoughts would be appreciated.######I think its called Millia, I had the same thing and couldnt figure it out for the life of me. . but checked out this blogand it helped A TON. It 's a blog run by a dermatologist who definately knows what she is talking about.######Last week I noticed I had a pimple on my chin, about 1/2 an inch from my lip. Well a head formed and I popped it and it seemed like a normal pimple. Just a few days ago, the spot started becoming more enflamed and skin started peeling away around the edges of it. After I wash my face everyday liquid starts coming out of it and eventually forms a crusty-ish looking/feeling scab. I 've never had a cold sore so I do n't know if I have a cold sore or not. I 'm 18, and have mild acne, so I do n't know if this has anything to do with it. My mom suggested I put Releev on it in case it is a cold sore. Anyone know what this could be?######same happening 2 me nover had acne now 31 its been 6 months. now today after a week free of the acne noticed about 7 small ones on my neck i think its migrating. help!######Same exact thing. Mine have turned into larger sores, (maybe 3-4 mm in diameter, but oblong), probably because i pick them excessively. (I am determined!) These sores contain clusters of what look like tiny whiteheads or plugs or watever. I ca n't usually squeeze them out, (THOUGH I Try), and light prodding procures blood from around them. They almost remind me of this planters wart I had one time on my foot. Little tendrils sparsely clustered in a sore that have really deep roots and dont go away or keep coming back. Help! ... I think Im going to see a dermetologist######THAT IS EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN GETTING !!!!! AHHHHHH I have cystic acne that gets pretty bad but these are different. Its just exactlythe way you described it. I was led to this page because I searched ``acne that looks like a plantar wart '' lol! With the tiny cluster of white dots and I ca n't help but poke and prod because I swear it looks like if I can just pick it out or squeeze hard enough it will all just unclog! But it wo n't! I hate this! If I find any information I 'll let you know.######I HAVE THIS EXACT PROBLEM TO THE TEE !!!!!! PLEASE PLEASE UPDATE IF YOU FIND ANYTHING!######I have had this problem for a long time. I read a post regarding the possibility of this being a fungal infection, i.e. ringworm of the face (tinnea faciei.) So I tried lotrimin cream, antifungal. Slowly, the fungus is receding and I 'm getting my face back. I have been using the cream for 3 weeks and my skin is not completely clear, but fungus is stubborn. By 4 weeks, things should be looking good, but the cream must be used for an additional week or two to make sure there 's no recurrence. I too saw a dermatologist twice and was prescribed an antibiotic. That and hydrocortisone cream make fungal infections WORSE! I too tried everything under the sun to rid myself of this awful skin affliction. I too began to feel so self conscious about my skin that I did n't want to go out any more. I did not feel comfortable without make-up. I can not believe this was a fungus! I wasted so much time and energy on this affliction. I was infected by a micro-organism. A simple fungus cream would have cleared it up and saved me a lot of physical and emotional harm! Use the cream on any itchy bump and be vigilant. The fungus does not want to go away easily, but it will go away. I had all but forgotten what having normal skin was like. I will keep an antifungal cream in the house in case of a future outbreak. I hope this information helps. This has been an unbelievable experience!######I have had a facial issue for over three years, and the spot is now about 4 times larger than when it started. Your answer is the FIRST plausible expanation and remedy that I have read in the time that I have been researching. Thank you !! I will try what you have suggested. Wish me luck!######I 'm just yelling this! Psoriasin Ointment healed my sores in 2 days! I am here to share because I have experienced all of the same symptoms for years now and this is the first thing that has knocked it down. Tried ACV, Antibiotics, steroidal and acne cream.

Give it a try. let me know if it works for you.######I have this same thing going on and I tried a aspirin and honey mask and after that is when I started getting the same red rised bumps/blisters. I wish I had never er done that stupid mask bc I think that 's what started it off. It 's around my lower chin on under the corners of my mouth and the bottom corners of my nose. It makes perfect scene now that it 's a fungus became honey has spores. I am going to the store tomorrow and getting the psoriasin ointment and trying that and hopefully getting rid of this for good or at least contain it better.

I use needle nose tweezer... which I should n't do... but I just want them gone... I have tried leaveing them alone... that does n't seem to help either... I have also tried every over the counter thing I could think of or was recommended... still searching for a mircle cure... anybody have any new ideas ??? Jules######Hi guys, I have just what you all are talking about, and it is so frustrating when I wash my face and I mask and I spot treat them, and nothing has worked. They are sometimes painful because I try to pop them. I only have 2 bad ones, one on my cheek and one on my nose but I spot treat them everyday with alcohol to try and dry them up. I think it seems to be working, or at least causing them to be less irritating. If they continue, I 'm definitely going to see my dermatologist!######hello everyone ive got them too and i cant find a solution any where it started off at first with one on my cheek i picked it a little pus came out but the spot didnt go away its just got bigger and now i have more little pimples in the same form around my mouth and chin i try to squeeze them but nothing comes out and they wont go away ive tried everything i clean my face very well in the morning and at night i dont know what else to do: (######WOW i did n't think anyone else suffered from the same thing. Mine are all around my nose, chin and cheeks. They come back in the same exact spots, over the existing scaring. I have been to dermatologists in DC, CT, PA, and NY and no one has been able to help me. I was diagnosed once with impetigo. I was given an antibiotic that worked but then it came back after a few months. It was gone for a while but started back up again recently but not it is worse. Does anyone else have the oozing/ weeping problem as well? I ca n't find anything online but this post. Someone PLEASE HELP!######My bio showed prurigo nodularis... capsaican cream and inject steroids is helping alot######For the past six months I 've had the same exact thing. Why is it that no one, including dermitologists, has any idea what this is.######I have this same problem. I started getting these sores on my chin when I was younger. For the longest time I did ' t get them on the chin and I started getting something similiar on my lip. The doctor said it was a cold sore and prescribed me Zovirax. It worked great and when I felt one coming up I just dabbed a little on and it went away quickly. Yesterday I thought I had a pimple coming in on my chin and did n't realize that it is what I used to get on my chin. I have tried the Zovirax on it. It seems to make it ooze a lot more and I think that it is helping but not as well as it did with what was on my lip. I would say to try cold sore medicine and see if it helps. I know from the past that I used to just pick it and get all the soft stuff off and it seemed to heal quicker but this still took several days to a week. I 'm hoping this Zovirax clears it up sooner.######i had this same thing and had no idea what it was. turns out it was millia. this blog that i found is run by a dermatologist and had a ton of info on it about everything skin and really helped me figure out what it was. good luck!######well... i think you should all put aloe vera oil on them. i had them and treated them as i stated and they are now gone. the scarring was there for about a month afterwards but it has now vanished. hope this helps.######I HAVE HAD THESE SORES THAT BLEED ALOT IF PICDED.I HAVE FOUND THAT PUTTING ANTI FUNGAL CREAM ON THEN SEEMS TO HEAL THEM AND WHAT I DO IS TO PICK IT TO MAKE IT BLEED AND THEN PUT SMALL AMOUNT OF CREAM ON IT, WHICH WILL MAKE IT BLEED MORE, KEEP PLOTTING UNTIL BLEEDING STOPS AND YOU WILL SEE SORE DISAPEAR IN COUPLE OF DAYS.MAKE SURE NOT TO SPREAD, WASH AREA AFTER BLOTTING.IT WILL SPREAD######While I find it comforting that others share my problem, I 'm disturbed that no one has found a solution. I have had these weeping sores on my chin (in the soul patch area) for 9 months now. I have gone to the doctor, thinking it was herpes, who informed me it was foliculitus (sp) that was continued by my shaving, and prescribed me an oral antibiotic. W/in 48 of STARTING the antibiotic, it goes away! But within 1 week of finishing, it comes right back. I have gone through 4 cycles of antibiotics... stopped shaving, used various creams... etc.. I am 37, and suffered from acnes as a teen, but acutane took care of that. These are different. They see ooze, and get crusty... if one small one starts in the morning, it can be 10 times bigger in the afternoon, and trying to pop or drain just makes it worse. The only thing that I have found is Desitin (40%) at night, then the creamy (h20 based) during the day (it 's not as obvious, blends a bit better). If I do this, without fail, it will keep it at bay, but if I miss ONE treatment, it comes back with a vengeance. I 'll try the aloe vera oil (?) recommended by the prev. poster. Good luck all.######Hello JCPowder. I have a similar condition, but only on one side of my face. I get spots/lumps which sometimes appear quite aggressively, pop on their own accord and then weep for anything upto 2 days. I have been suffering with this problem for about 3 years now and it is more than just frustrating. I am wondering if it is a food allergy. Do you have an update?

I have not noticed any change in colour since it changed light brown and there are no bumps, it seems flat. The Doctor has said not to worry about it. Iâ$ ve attached several photos of the blemish, one as it is with wrinkles and the other with the skin stretched flat to show the shape. I wonder if anybody can give a name to this type of blemish and if itâ$ s normal for it to spread over the years. http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff326/c rismyphotos/P6060019a. jpg http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff326/c rismyphotos/P9270018. jpg Thank you######IT looks like your skin is pretty fair, eh? From a little bit of research, it seems that you might be experiencing actinic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses. During this skin condition, small rough or scaly areas of skin appear due to damage from sun exposure. Some actinic keratoses can turn into squamous cell skin cancer, so it is important to perform self-examinations often and catch them early. You might also want to insist on seeing a skin specialist. A dermatologist is better qualified to diagnose the lesion and to decide if a lesion should be biopsied or treated.######I have recently started to collect information about this blemish and inevitable skin cancer keeps cropping up. Iâ$ ve looked at actinic keratoses; I donâ$ t think my blemish is scaly, it may look like that because of the deep wrinkles and it doesnâ$ t feel rough (as sandpaper) but is quite smooth like the surrounding skin when I stretch the skin. I agree the advice to regular monitor the blemish; during my reading the idea of taking digital photos is also good. The doctor did look closely and didnâ$ t see cause for concern; but I think later I will press for a dermatologist to have a look. I may even arrange to see a local clinic about non surgical cosmetic applications to temporary hide the blemish, itâ$ s in rather a prominent place and their dermatologist may also be able to give me a definite name for the blemish.######Sounds like a plan. Please let us know what the dermatologist says. I 'd be interested to see if s/he can help you with temporary cover up and longer term diagnosis..######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

I had a bcc removed several years ago and went to the doc last May and this was n't even there. The doc said this could double in size every month. I had this removed last week and waiting for the results to whether it was all removed. The doc said I have a 94% survival rate with this. Sounds good be when its you it rocks your world. I will go back next week to have the stitches removed and wondering what should I do to verify it has not spread into the blood system. If nothing is found around the tissue that was removed should I still have a scan and blood work? Also, what are the chances of the melanoma coming back? Thanks, Barry######According to survival rates you were told, I guess you are having an early stage of melanoma. Lymph nodes biopsy of the regional lymph nodes is usually performed to check for local metastases. You should ask to get checked for melanoma metastasis, cause there are cases when thin melanoma has spread distantly. You dermatologist is probably familiar with serological, immunohystochemical and histological prognostic markers. The annual risk of recurrence for tumors < 1.5 mm thick remains < 6% for the first five years dropping to under 1% for the next five years.######I have an appt next week to go back to have follow-up and just talked to nurse. She says that the tissue around the melanoma was free from any cancer and I also asked about the depth and stage etc.. She said it was superficial and lever 3 and the size was 0.51.

I can say maybe 2-3 days per year I am capable of being normal and its so great to feel good but it never lasts.######Hello, and thanks for your medical question on eHealth forum! I am not sure what allergy shots you were getting or why they were stopped. Chronic sinusitis is often allergic and can be due to mold infection too. A damp wall in the house, carpets, and ACs are all potential sources of mold. Please consult an allergy specialist. You may need to take the allergy test. Chronic sinusitis can also be due to EBV infection. The other possibility is deviated nasal septum (this was corrected in your case). Nasal polyps and tumors, worms in stool causing high eosinophil counts, gastric reflux are the other causes. The treatment will be complete only on removing the cause. Hence please consult an ENT specialist (you must already be under one) and discuss these possibilities. Depending on the cause treatment will be prescribed. Hope this helps. Take care!######Ime told i have alergies to mold,, i will contact my dr asap and try it again. Whene i was a kid i had allergies to dogs-cats-dust-drass-oak trees- you name it. Ive been tested later on in life and allot of those went away? This simply stinks to have to live like this every day! Thank You !!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Sinusitis

It started right after what my doctor told me was a bronchitis. Since then I cough up green chunks every morning. The green chunks are annoying because they get stuck at the back of my throat and sometimes makes breathing annoying when lying down. While I sleep some chunks get stuck on the top of my tonsils. It does n't completely stop during the day, it keeps me coughing to clear up my throat. What alarms me the most about it is that my doctor has no idea what it is and has given me all kinds of nasal sprays, medications and antibiotics that did n't improve anything at all. I put this post under sinusitis since I was falsely diagnosed with chronic sinusitis by my doctor for a long time even though the x-rays she made me take were negative. The hospital and an ENT specialist also told me I did n't had chronic sinusitis. The ENT says it is not sinus related. The problem is that my immune system is low since then and that I 've been having recurring cases of strep throat or laryngitis. The green phlegm however is not clearing up after the strep throat gets treated or the laryngitis clears up. Other then the phlegm, I do n't have any other constant symptoms, though at first I had chest pains in the upper middle of my chest but they were n't very frequent. Since I now consider my family doctor almost incompetent, is there a direction I should point her to? Should I go somewhere else? My next step I asked her for is to see an allergist, even though I have not noticed any allergies and even if I change my routine completely or live somewhere else for a while, nothing changes. Can it be stomach related? Can it be lung related? Can it be mold related?######Hello! Welcome on eHealth forum and hope you find a satisfactory answer to your query! A cough is generally a result of an irritant such as stomach acid (gastric reflux), mucus (asthma), hair spray, perfume, dust, pollen, mold, even spicy food, post nasal drip, or infection. It could also be due to infection such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Chronic sore throats can be allergic, viral or bacterial in origin. Many viral conditions like EBV (glandular fever) behave in this way with recurrent respiratory infections. Many parasitic infestations and worms increase the eosinophil counts in the blood and thus cause an increased risk of upper respiratory infections. Conditions like tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, asbestosis and silicosis along with pulmonary fibrosis should be ruled out. If there is no fever then chances of allergic reaction, asthma, acidity and reflux and high eosinophil count are more. Common allergens causing these symptoms are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander. Streptoccocal infection is the most common bacterial infection and can cause nasal symptoms too. Indoor exposure to black mold can cause upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sore throat and cough with or without wheeze in otherwise healthy people. Ideally you should consult a chest specialist. A comprehensive investigation including CBC, throat swab, allergic tests, X-rays, examination with a scope in throat, spirometry etc is required keeping all the points in mind. Taking antibiotics without knowing what is the cause of persistent cough will not help much. A throat swab and the phlegm should be given for culture and sensitivity to see what organism is causing the cough and what antibiotic may act against it. If it is viral or allergic then no culture will be formed. If it is due to air conditioning, you will have to use a humidifier. If it is due to asthma, then proper treatment will have to be done. If mold is the culprit, then you will have to get your house checked for the source and treated. Gastric reflux too could be the cause. The treating reflux with drugs and lifestyle changes with decreasing coffee, alcohol, smoking and spicy food will help. Meanwhile try deep breathing exercise and steam inhalation. Over the counter antihistamines, and decongestants and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs may all help. However please take with prescription. Steam inhalation, drinking hot fluids and soups, warm lemonade, gargling with warm saline water are all very helpful. Do discuss with your doctor and first try and find the cause. Take care!######Thank you so much for the reply and the question.

The diagnosis suprised me as the intent of the MRI was to look for Tumors due to neck problems. I had no idea as to my knowledge I had not experienced any real symptoms. I do n't have post nasal drip. All I get is Phlegm collecting in the back of my throat (It 's greenish yellow but more yellow than green) which I have been hacking up for 10 years. I hack up more in the morning, but also hack it up a couple times a day. I notice no brown in this green/yellowish icky stuff. Once in a great while a little bit of mucousy blood. I used to live in the Northwest in an apartment with black mold growing on the bathroom walls and in the garage. The complex was huge but built on essentially wetlands. I lived there about a year, then finally when a huge chunk of the garage ceiling caved in. It got to the point that I had to wipe the mold off the bathroom wall every couple of days so I figured enough and moved. The complex was only a couple of years old too. As a teen I was prescribed Tetracycline for Acne and took this daily (1 pill- I do n't know the amount per capsule) for about a year. It never helped so I quit the pills. But that was more than 10 years ago. As of yesterday I read about the ``spit test '' for Candida. I had arms growing from the top of the water to the bottom of the glass in minutes and in about 15 mintues just a cloud of saliva at the bottom of the glass. I am male, but I think that I may have intenstinal imbalances effeting my body. I have normal bowel movements almost like clockwork. One in the morning, and smaller one at night. I seem to digest food fine, but I may actually have a problem, I do n't know what to look for as I do n't get indegestion or stomach aches or constipation. My stools are not soft or hard, just normal to me. I eat no dairy (even quit yogurt- stonyfield farms brand- which I like, and Helios Nutrion Keifer). So totally dairy free for about 2 months. I do not drink Soda. I recently quit whole grain bread and cereals. I gave up white bread about 2 years ago for not particular reason other than it has no nutrition. I drink bottled water, I eat almost no packaged foods. I do what I can to get 5 servings of fruits and vegetables. I just stopped dried fruits (raisons and cranberries). So now I basically eat Coleman Beef, Free Range Chicken, and vegetables. I have lost 25 to 30lbs in the past year (and I am getting way too thin 6 ' 4 '' and 183lbs as weighed at the doctors office 2 weeks ago). I try to eat every time I get up just to make sure I am consuming calories. But I ca n't seem to gain weight. I also like to eat whole wheat pasta and organic pasta sause (which does have some organic cheese). It 's tough finding things I can eat that have enough calories to keep me at a stable weight. Anyways now for the questions: 1. Anyone have Chronic Sinusitis without post nasal drip and without headaches in the front of your sinuses? 2. I get headaches in the center back of my neck to the base of my head, I feel constant pressure in this area and it causes nausea, constant nausea but I do not throw up. 3. I went to a Naturopathic Physicain this past week (I am trying lots of doctors and trying an ENT next) and he put ``essential oils '' (almond, oregeno, etc.) into my nose with long sticks. He twisted the stick into my right nostril about 2 inches with no problems. About 1 inch into my left nostril he hit tissue, and I felt extreme pain and my eyes immediately teared like crazy. He stopped and tried to push it in another half inch and just too much pain to tolerate. So obviously I have swelling or a polyp or some kind of structural problem in the left nostril. This is also the nostril that I get nosebleeds in every winter. 4. I can create a very faint cracking sound when I pop my jaw 5. I use a saline/backing soda nasal rinse with a waterpik and nose attachement. After about 8 ounces (4 ounces on each side) I gentley blow my nose. I feel a popping sensation in the right ear, but not the left. You know the kind of popping you get when you are driving from low altitude to high altitude or as an airplane asends or desends. 6. I do n't feel pressure or fullness or any kind of pain in my ears, and my hearing seems to be okay from what I can tell. So any ideas? I have herniated discs in my neck, seen the neurologists, the neurosurgeon (no surgery), the physiatrist, NUCCA Chrio, Sports Chiro, and I now belive my constant nausea and imbalance is not my neck but an infection. The Naturopath suggested an inner ear virus (but it will be a whole year of symptoms this coming August 16, 2005). I read most of those (viral ear infections) resolve in weeks and months not years. Who knows? I have read sinus problems can cause neck pain and aches. I know very little about Candida but do know it can morph into fungus with rhizoids and cause problems in the intestinal wall. Do these rhizoids do the same in the Nasal Cavities? I have read the Summary of the tests at the Mayo Clinic in 1999 that suggest up to 95% of chronic sinusitis is caused in the mucus by an autoimmune response to the fungus. And Candida can turn into fungus, and I did take tetracycline so maybe an opportune virus jumped on board after just too much Candida? I never paid much attention to my carb consumption until this illness but it was probably quite high as I consumed a lot of grains in the form of whole wheat bread, oatmeal and boxed cereals. I used to eat cereal like Sinefield, raison bran was my preferred snack. I also used to eat a lot of Mild Cheddar Cheese and 2% milk. I am not so much looking for answers (I wish someone really could diagnose me) as much as ``paths '' to try, suggestions, and experiences of others. I have yet to read about anyone with ``neck pressure '' and all I do is read forums and research studies all day. Honeslty I 've read 1,000's but I learn something new each day. I am currently (as of yesterday) supplementing Capryl and will cut my sugar (except for the berries in my morning shake) and grains to nill. Maybe I will need to cut the berries too. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated. I should also mention that I am tired all the time, I sleep maybe 1 to 3 hours at a time and wake for reasons I can not figure out, I get night sweats but not all the time, but usually not when I am first trying to sleep but after the 2nd or 3rd attempt (like 3 am), but they clear when I awake in the morning. My arms feel much more weak than my legs. I supplement a lot of Vitamin C, and 1000mg/500mg Calcium Magnesium Citrate. I feel as if I would be ``fine '' if I could only shake this constant pressure and nausea. Everything refers to my mid back neck area (where there is disc herniation) but who knows where it starts. I am usually achey, but only in my arm joints not my legs or my fingers, of course in my neck. The cliche of ``flu like symptoms '' does apply. And to throw in one last thing, but not to throw you off, I have had all my amalgams replaced in Feb-March 2005, but I had all these symptoms before then and did n't notice a big change in them after the replacement. Thanks######I have had chronic sinusitis and post frequently on the allergy board. First of all, I would not say your sinus infection is asymptomatic. Rather you show many symptoms, albeit rather mild. Your yellow/green mucus is not normal. It is a symptom of your sinusitis. Normal mucus is clear or white. Infected mucus dripping into your stomach can cause nausea. It is also very possible that the sinusitis is causing your neck pains. For me, neck pains ususally accompany a headache, though. However, it is not unusal for you not to have sinus pain. My headaches were always near the temples, despite the frontal sinuses being infected. Also, a mild, chronic, untreated infection can give you the flu-like symptoms you describe. For me, I always can tell now when I am getting a sinus infection because well before the sinus pain starts, I feel achy all over, like I have the flu. I also get night sweats when I am fighting off an infection. While I do believe Candida is a valid condition and a concern, I also believe that it is easily mistaken for other things. It is important with Candida to rule out other causes of your symptoms first. It is also important to realize Candida is an opportunistic infection, meaning if your immunity is compromised by another disease (in your case a chronic sinus infection) it can more easily take hold in your body. My question for you is, have you had the sinus infection treated at all? You really need to see an ENT right away, and you need to bring that CT scan with you. This is one instance where I think antibiotics are neccessary. In the meantime, continue doing your nasal irrigations. A mucus thinner like Mucinex might also help, though I would wait to see the ENT before taking it. I have found NAC to be a helpful anti-oxidant in helping fight infections, as well as vitamin E and vitamin C. Good luck and let us know how it goes.######Thank you. I supplement Ester C between 1500 and 3000mg daily. I may up this as I have taken as much as 10,000 to 15,000 in the past and have not had problems. I know when you are ill, at least for me more vitamin c seems to be tolerated. I 've never even come close to bowel titration. I started taking Capryl yesterday the Solray brand- magensium, calcium, zinc. I do n't know what the Caprylate form means, I also supplement the citrate form which I understand. I read there were virtually no side effects so I thought I would give it a run. My choice of the term Asymptomatic was a POOR one. I should have said I do n't realize I have symptoms, I 'm sure the symptoms are there. I also did n't take into account that I could have the crud in my stomach yet it should have dawned on me. I have little discharge and can not taste the phlegm and do n't seem to get bad breath (at least that my friends would notice) but it is definitely greenish/yellowish. I wonder if another disease did n't piggyback onto this one. Meaning my immune system was suppressed (I am sure it still is) and cause me even more trouble. Perhaps an ear problem, and my body is simply too weak to fight it. I was on tetracycline for more than a year but that was a long ways back, but who knows it could have damaged me enough so the when my immune system got weak enough another problem could present. Antibotics scare me, but if they can get me to the point that these sysmptoms subside then I can work more on diet (I do a lot already) and rebuilding my gastrointestinal flora with the help of a nutritioinist or naturopath. I am very frustrated with compartmentalize Allopathic physicans. You would have thought that one of them would have referred me to an ENT. But NO! And they all knew I had sinusitis. One even gave me free samples of nasonex and allegra. I tried to book my own appointment with and ENT about 5 months ago but they will not take you without a referral and because of my neck problems the doctors kept sending me to neurologits and thats the story. I have a prescription from my Natropath and got blown off by the local University Hospital (I guess they do n't believe he is a doctor even though the State I live in Licenses them, and he has a very good reputation). So I am going to plant myself at the local Hospital Owned Dizziness Clinic tommorrow with prescription in hand until I can get an appointment. I took the ``spit test '' for candida and will post another note about that. But within minutes I had legs from the top of the glass to the bottom. I had my parents do the same thing, and nothing at all. So I am sure I am infected, and probably with more than one kind of pathogen. That would certainly explain the flu like weakness. I have had an MRI but not a CT Scan. I understand the CT scan shows the bony mass much better. I will probably need to have that too. Man I feel like I am finally onto something which can help and I owe this new lead to the many postings on this board and the open minded thinking of the Naturopath. Because my Sinusitis does n't give me headaches in the front of my head I had continued to work the neck problem angle. I hope this does work and I will be very happy for the relief and very frustrated that among all the physicians I have seen including Dentists, Endodontists, etc etc and their full knowledge that I have Chronic Sinusitis not one has referred me to an ENT. I have told each of them I am constantly Nauseas and Dizzy. I did get a referral to a Gastroenterologist but that was a dead end. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply. I will post my spit test question to alternative health. I AM AMAZED THAT WITH THE PREVELANCE OF SINUSITIS THERE IS N'T A BOARD HERE TO DISCUSS JUST THAT TOPIC.######That is so interesting that you had your parents do the spit test. I too, have passed the spit test, I and never thought to have my husband try it to test it 's validity. But I am convinced that even though I have it, it is not the ONLY cause of my problems, but rather a contributing factor. I feel you frustration. I have horrible allergies, and was under the care of an allergist, and I still could n't get an ENT referral from my primary care doctor either. He said I did n't need one! My allergist was the one who ordered my CT scan, and when the results came in, my primary doctor had no choice but to refer me, and I ended up needing sinus surgery! I do n't know why primary care doctors are so stupid when it comes to sinusitis. You should check out the allergy board. We discuss sinusitis there all the time..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

I used to get at least 1 per year. Well this one never went away. I have been experiencing complete swelling of my sinuses, sever post nasal drip, coughing up mucus, developed asthma as a result of that, nasal polyps. After going to several different docs, their final diagnosis was the polyps and deviated septum. I had surgery to repair that and remove the polyps. 4 weeks later the sympoms returned. Complete and total congestion. I can not breathe through my nose at all. Tests show I get staph infections in my nose, no allergies, have been on every allergy medicine, antibiotic and nasal inhaler known to mankind. Nothing works. My post nasal drip was so severe in february that I ended up with pneumonia. Docs are perplexed and have no idea what else to do for me. Prednisone is the only thing that completely clears me up and helps me feel semi normal again but you cant take that long term. It 's a catch 22. I either suffer the consequencs of long term prednisone or I get pneumonia and possbily die from it someday. Does anyone have any suggestions or other things to try? Ive tried home remedies, Ive tried everything. I am at a loss and my quality of life has gone down the drain. Help ??######I really ca n't tell you anything. I had the same problem but the surgery cleared it up for me. Have they taken a ct of your head to see if you have chronic sinusitis?######Hi there i 'm a 33 yr old female, i too have severe nasal problems, it started 5 yrs ago with hayfever, then it developed into asthma, then i started to grow nasal polyps and have had three op's now, my asthma is called Samter's Syndrome i 'm allergic to most pain relief and have to follow a Salicylate free diet. My second operation the surgeon drilled into my sinuses, thus helping me to breathe more easily, that has worked quite well but i seem to grow the polyps at a fast rate, and i 'm on flixonase steroid drops and when asthma gets bad i take prednislone, it is a hellish thing to go through and i feel that people do n't really understand how painfull it all is as i 'm sure you know, I live in Scotland in a city but i hopefully will move to a coastal location and i truly wish this will help, fresher air etc, right now im waiting to get another op, and it ca n't come quick enough as it really interferes with the asthma, i hope this has helped you in some way######Hi there, I am also a Scot from Glasgow, living in Dundee, and am 23 years old. I 've had the same symptoms as you constantly since I was 14 years old and, as I 'm sure you 'll be familiar with, it has a bad impact on every aspect of my life. I had grown to accept that I may have this permanently, but recently I 've discovered that stress really exacerbates the symptoms. I have tried a few relaxation-based therapies and found them to help. I find reiki and neck, back, shoulder and face massage very beneficial and you might too. It may not work for you but I know how severely crap this condition is so it would be worth a try Emily. P.s.- They tried me on all the diets (inc. salicylate-free), operations, nasal sprays, washes, antibiotics... The drugs are absolutely hopeless and having tried them all to no avail, I really think natural therapies are much better. It does n't seem right to pump the body full of medication when it does n't really do anything.######Gosh, luvyadoofy, I had to read that twice to make sure it was n't me! I even live in the same part of the world as you- maybe even the same city, who knows! The only difference is that you have had three ops and I have had- none. I am on a huge waiting list and meantime I am chronically stuffed up and it makes my asthma really bad at this time of year. I think I want to move to a nice hot climate.######hello nallen 06, iread your letter even though its from a long time ago, and i have just jioned ehealth.I have had nasal polyps for 22 years.I have tried everthing ,3 ops, naturopathy, homeopathy.I have done extensive research and belive nasal plyps are an allergic reaction to fungas.its called allergic Fungal sinisitus.try changing your diet, avoiding refined Carbohydrates, sugars, dairy and wheat and see how you feel, good luck######Have you ever been checked for acid reflux? Your story sounds a lot like mine. I went to the regional health university and the Mayo Clinic and they all missed that I had acid reflux. I had the surgery to fix that a couple of years ago and it greatly enhanced my symptoms but I still have some problems (I think due to the fact the surgeon did not make the stomach wrap as tight as it should be). Do you have problems of getting really congested overnight or going to bed feeling fine and waking up the next morning totally infected? My problems also tended to be more seasonal (wintertime) to start with and then became year-round. I think that 's because I went to bed earlier in the winter months and slept more, causing more reflux problems.######I have nasal polyps and excessive mucus in the throat and mouth it clings to my teeth and under my gums, causing food to stick in between my teeth the pain is terrible with earache and headaches, I constantly clean my teeth but it will not remove, even the hygienist is unable to remove it as it is constant, any suggestions? will it improve when the polyps shrink? . The gastro resistant capsules dont seem to relieve or will they take time? Look forward to some answers######Has anyone had a leak into their mouth from nasal polyps, my teeth are always covered in mucas which is impossible to remove especially the teeth directly below my nostrils. Appreciate some feedback (hmblower######I have experienced this & more but i chose to not have any sergery & have educated myself & am currently having success with nutritional direction & thyroid dysfunction as well as adrenal fatigue it is too detailed but i can help any one willing to research for them selves by giving you info of what worked for me & where to go to find the information. Email me through this subject logo (avatar). Please be patient & i will reply eventually! Good health!######I am looking forward to any research you have on my symptoms, as for 2 years I have been told by oral medicine that it is my own poorly produced saliva sticky like glue as the saliva glands are not producing healthy liquid. But recently a nose specialist has a diagnosis of polyps and acid and since taking the sprays and gastro capsules have noticed some changes, I can now feel my teeth and gums at times now and am spitting out some horrible matter from the back of my throat, I just hope it cures it as I have 2 more months to go, even the headaches and earaches and neck problems are less seldom, any comments######click on thr logo (avatar) beside my user name, on the new page select send a message. from there we can email each other via this site without either risking security this will teach you how you can learn nutritional management & balance for all good health.######I just had my first polypectomy, with a septoplasty and turbinate reduction thrown in to help reduce the chance of recurrent polyps. My father had polyps a few years back and his surgery made his life so much better- never gets sinus infections anymore, and allergies are more tolerable. I figured mine would go the same way, but at my two week post-op appointment, my surgeon/ENT saw polyps again! Only two weeks later. I was put on prednisone and antibiotics for a staph infection from the culture taken at the surgery, and now I do n't go back for another 5 weeks. However, I can still smell the infection and am still very congested. I do n't think the steroids or antibiotics did anything! I am afraid of having to go through surgery again, especially since I have n't read of any single person going through surgery twice and having it work. Its like it works the first time or it never seems to fix the problem. My polyps were n't malignant, and I have been on nasal steroids for a decade, so there 's no chance that those will work alone to control the polyps. I ca n't escape my allergies, and follow my Dr's orders to the T. Any suggestions to keep the inflammation from coming back? Has anyone had a successful second surgery that has n't regrown polyps? I just do n't want to waste the money if I will lose my ability to smell/taste/breathe anyway. Thanks!######I read that overuse of antibiotics for sinusitis can cause candidiasis, which can cause the sinusitis to get worse.######My experience with the sinus and polyps is the pain and pressure in my gums, I have been using the steroid spray and it relieved but now finishing as it was prescibed for 3 months its returned but more focal to a sore nostril and the gum on the same side with ear pain. I am hoping that removal will be the answer. Any comments Cathy77############the diet for treating sinusitis is unfortunately quite severe, you basically can hardly eat anything. But yes, as this person says, you need to avoid eating sugar, dairy and wheat.######I have nasal polyps/asthma and an allergy to ASA and have had FIVE operations over the past 16 years. Between op 4 and 5 (five years apart- first 4 were every 2-3 years) I discovered the best thing to do is flush every morning with salt water (or Hydrasense). This flushes the mucus out to relieve sinus pressure and post nasal drip. I have tried every herbal/medical remedy and nothing keeps them from growing back.######Hi!I have also nasal polyps. I want to know better foods to eat. . i read the suggestion of you ADVENTURER, what are those foods that you can suggest... i dont want to undergo again on operation...######Hi ghel, in response to your reply, from what I, ve gathered Dairy, wheat and salicylates in food tend to promote Nasal polyp growth.Saliclates foods are most berries, and frits which have Aspirin in them.The hard part of the nasal polyp cure is to stay on the restrictive diet for a while.Operations are good for three months or so, andpredisolone has major side affects.######I go to ENT next week after 5 weeks on steroid spray, the surgeon said he thinks the mucus in my mouth is coming from tha sinus's, meanwhile I had a MRI scan and am hoping he can remove the polyps and somehow clear rhe sinus's. The matter on my teeth and gums now moves around but I cant shift it all the brushing seems to spread it. best wishes H Blower######I found I had nasal polyps in 2005 had operation in 2006 and 4 months later they were back, with the same symptoms, sneezing, runny nose, asthma like symptoms due to post nasal drip. My sinuses all inflammed most of the time. Now I am looking into food allergies, milk is one thing I know does n't help at all. Now I 'm trying accupuncture for relieve the inflammation. Having polyps is not a big deal but its the inflammation that really bothers me. my sinuses open up when I play sports or move around walking here to there. Once I sit down, either one or both sides get blocked, ca n't breather through the nose. Remember doctors only cure the symptoms not the problem. I am taking Claritin (allergy 24 hours, extra strength) on a regular basis, which is helping subside the symptoms until I find something more concrete of a solution. My ENT did n't tell me to take claritin he gave me spray which didnt work because how is it suppose to get where it needs to go if its inflammed, salin rinses I think are only good if you have air borne allergies, but rinse wo n't hurt for sure. I would do it if I could find the time when both nostrils are open at the same time.######Hi all. . I had surgery to remove polyps about 5 years ago. I was told they would return. . I crossed my fingers and toes and hoped it was n't going to happen to me. They 're back. Before my surgery, one of three doctors I had, was certain that it had a fungal connection. We tested and it came back negative. A month or so ago, I was given a antibiotic. . ca n't remember the name now, but it cleared me up and it even gave me my smell back for about two weeks. Oh those who can smell do n't know how lucky they are. anyway. . has anyone gone through a particular antibiotic that has helped them? I 've seen some research that suggests we are n't taking the antibiotics long enough. . instead of 2 weeks we should tkae them for 6 months. Your thoughts?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Sinusitis

Last year I started with a blocked feeling in my left ear, it also went into my left cheek and side of the head like a sinus pain, it went on and on for months. I saw my GP who refered me to ENT, they did a CT scan and all was perfectly normal so sent me on my way and said I had TMJ or Neuralgia. In March this year it came back on me, it had got better for a little while but I got sinusitis in feb and then I suffered with a blocked ear again for months and months, I saw the ENT man again in June and he did an ear pressure test and said all was perfect and not to worry. I suffer almost daily with one of the ears/cheeks feeling full and often have a drip down back of my throat. It can be quite painful/uncomfortable and the side I get the discomfort in that nostril will feel blocked but the next day it could swap sides, does that make sense?lol! Last week I started with a swollen throat feeling, I had white spots on my right tonsil so im taking penicillin from my doctor. I am worrying its because ive chronic sinusitis, GP and ENT say im fine but I find it hard to believe it had n't developed this year. I also had bronchitis in August, something ive never had and im getting myself all worried. Does it sound like chronic sinsuitis? my gp says its just alergies and the way I am, I get worse in the dry heat or damp weather, he says im little with delicate linings, grrrrrrrrr.######I 'm not sure what 's going on with you but a couple of thoughts- first of all, have you had allergy tests? If not, you should get tested to identify what you 're allergic to or rule out allergies completely. The other thing you might think about is whether you get heartburn very frequently- acid reflux can actually create symptoms similar to chronic sinusitis if the stomach acid irritates the membranes in your throat. If the ENT does n't think you have chronic sinusitis you probably do n't have to worry about that- it 's more important to figure out what else might be causing your symptoms.######HI, I sufer with awful heartburn at times, since childhood I recall having a snotty nose & bad wind pain in my tummy and chest. I always had them. The thing is why would i get proper sinus and ear pain if I didnt have a sinus problem? My arguement with my dr is that just because my CT scan was clear last year surely that does n't mean I ca n't have chronic sinusitis now but he just laughs at me ?????######PS Here they do not do allergy testing anymore, the dr refused it.############Thanks My GP says they do not do it on the NHS anymore and that im probably allergic to a number of things including dust mites, chemicals in household cleaners etc.... Today I have a wierd symptom, my right ear feels abit warm and itchy and my nose and throat do too, very odd, lol! If I had chronic sinusitis is it true that id more than likely have a fever and constant pain over the infected sinus? Any reassurance appreicated.######Hello Essica, I have chronic sinusitis maxillaris, but there is no fever at all. In contrary I have never fever (normally from 35,5- 36 degrees). What makes me so is my Thyroid. I have hypotireosis. My sinusitis is totally dry. My face is swollen and I have eyes pains (it is normally by sinusitis maxillaris, in the face). There is possibility that your sinusitis is from neck muscles (so told me more doctors for my case); could be from teeth as well. On your place I would make CT of NECK as also CT of SINUSITIS (CT shows all). If you can do that, do it. Beside that go to dentist and tell him your problems. Maybe some of teeth are sick and you do n't feel it? healthy333######Thanks, My GP does think im very tense so its muscle tension alot of it. I would of thought that if i had chronic sinusitis id be unwell ????? my gp said its an infection so I would have a fever, green mucus from nose, headaches and he said it would not jump sides every other day ??? I am just fed up of it.######If you 've had consistent heartburn you should definitely consider the possibility that acid reflux is behind some of your symptoms. Below is a quote from research being done at the University of Wisconsin- if you go to Googl \* and search for ``Acid Reflux '' and ``Sinusitis '' you 'll find a lot more information. ``In patients with chronic sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), a large number of acid reflux events reach the top of the esophagus near the sinuses compared to a control group. While acid reflux probably does not reach all the way to the sinuses, it could induce inflammation of nasal mucous, blocking the sinuses. '' I do n't know if Zantac is available over the counter in the UK but if it is, you could try taking Zantac for a couple of weeks to see if it addresses your heartburn symptoms and helps improve your sinuses- when my doctor recommended this to me I noticed an improvement in my sinus and asthma symptoms about 5 days after I started the meds..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

I 've read that it 's caused by allergies, infections etc., but just had an allergy test and according to the test I only have seasonal allergy. I have pretty much suffer from pnd my whole life. Also I have to constantly spit into a tissue which is very annoying, because mucus almost never comes out of the nose. I had a CT-Scan and according to the ENT specialist there 's no infection. Though I 'm not really sure if CT-scans are 100% reliable. I did have a deviated septum, but I 've had a surgery to fix this, but it did n't stop the post nasal drip. This is getting really frustrating because it 's also causing me to have bad breath and I do n't have any contact with anyone. Plz help, I 'm really going crazy... Do n't want the rest of my life to be like this######Seasonal allergies can keep post nasal drip going year round. Have you tried taking an antihistamine? There are some over the counter that are plain antihistamine without deconjestants and some with. For me there is something all the time that keeps my seasonal allergy in high gear.######In my case, my turbinates were enlarged at random times during the day (usualy when I was going out) blocking my nose a little (I could still breath after swallowing the mucus) and causing me horrible pnd. During the deviated septum surgery I had a few days back, they also cauterize the turbinates preventing them from expanding. I guess that was an allergic reaction? So, Im on day two after having everything removed from my nose and I can say I probably have no post nasal drip any more. Maybe a little bit but that will probably go away too.######I had my septum surgery a month ago, but it did n't really stop the pnd. I still have to spit all that white mucus out. i ca n't blow it out because it gets stuck in my nose. I did n't have the turbinates expand prevention thing, but the ENT's here are not really willing to help me. They 're just like take the nasal spray and beat it. I 'm really sick of my life to be honest.######Are you doing nasal irrigations? It 's not going to eliminate PND entirely but may help in thinning out the mucuos and allowing it to drain properly.######and unfortunately the only product that helps me is Sudafed 12 hr release; and they 're going to make it even harder for us to buy; hey thanks addicts!######Noptical, can you tell me how you are doing now after your septum surgery + turbinates reduction. Do you still suffer from bad breath ?? I feel like my septum surgery has n't even helped me one bit: S######Almost no change altough now I can sometimes blow my nose. Dunno what causes it but my nostrils get blocked (turbinates?) alternately during the day (70% of the time is the left one which led me to think that maybe they didnt cauterize the turbinates enough?) . This makes the mucus going down my throat (bb cause 1) and especially when I go outside there 's SO much mucus i just cant breath (sorry for the graphic description). Now, only causes left are, chronic sinusitis (due to mucus build up in sinuses) and allergies which cause my turbinates to expand. First one treated with surgergy (search for posts of user ``chuckwho '') the other one with drugs and turbinate reduction (prevents turbinates from blocking your nose). Go to an ENT, the biggest of most bb sufferers in this forum is that they 're too shy to tell a doc. Overcome this fear and tell him everything. The trick is to find the right doc who 's willing to help and has the proper knowledge which is hard (I know because my 5th ENT was the only one who seemed to know what he was doing, but most docs where I live lousy here anyway). I 'm pretty positive that I will solve this problem and I 'm not going to stop looking for the solution until I find it. GO TO AN ENT AND TELL HIM YOU HAVE BAD BREATH AND WANT IT TO GO AWAY NO MATTER WHAT.######I 've been to 3 different ENT's, two in this country and one outside. None of them have been able to figure out what 's wrong with me. I 've told them everything, I do admit I was a little shy in the beginning when I told them but now I realize it is n't my fault. Two of the ENT's even said post nasal drip ca n't cause bad breath, but I 've read somewhere on the site that the ENT's have lack of knowledge on this problem and they say bad breath will be coming from your stomach. If an ENT tells you this you should visit another one. I had one that did say it was possible pnd causes bad breath but he has n't been able to help me either. I 've done an CT Scan but it did n't show an infection. What I do n't understand is that there are some people who have constant post nasal drip but do n't suffer from bad breath at all. There moust be something wrong with the mucous. This is crazy now because of the fact I visited three ENT's and none of them has been able to help me, My family think it 's a psychological problem. But I get reactions all the time when I talk to them face to face, that 's why I try to avoid that all the time. I 've kinda lost my trust in every ENT here on this planet. I think it 's better to look for a solution yourself since I 'm pretty sure that the chances of someone having this problem are very small, like a 0,001% chance. That 's why most of the ENT's wo n't be able to figure out what 's wrong with you or wo n't believe you. Is your mucous also like clear or sometimes white colored and very thick and hard to swallow ??? The ENT's I visited say it 's only possible that you have a sinus infection if the mucous is yellow- or green-coloured, but another member on this forum ``chuckwho '' who got cured from the infection said his mucous was very gluey and clear too.######What I learned: if one doc ca n't help, go to another one until you find the solution even if it takes to visit 15 or 20 docs. That 's better than living with this problem for your whole life right? My mucus BEFORE the surgery was almost always (if not just always) completely clear, like water only slimy. Or maybe sometimes it was milky white (not a clear white fluid, but a white fluid with bubbles or something like that). Now after the surgery mucus wo n't just run through the nose, I have to blow it (sometimes impossible but I think nasal irrigation helps). And it is sometimes white (the one I mentioned before) or sometimes (maybe most of the times) green. For the first 2-3 weeks after the surgery (now its 4 weeks and a few days, since march 21st) it was green/brown or just pure brown (blood?) . Yes post nasal drip CAN cause bad breath, the ENT who denies it automatically accepts that he 's an idiot. 2 reasons: 1. The bacteria on your tongue feed on your mucus and produce that nasty white stuff (probably related to No2) 2. The mucus caries pus to the back of your tongue and throat (not sure if it is pus, but I read somewhere that it is the pus that the mucus contains because of the infection, causes the bad breath). Things you have to do: 1. Get tested for allergies (IMPORTANT) 2. Find another ENT I also read somewhere that a sinus infection can be fungal or viral and the one that causes bb is the fungal one while viral is the one most people get. I 'm going to test myself for allergies and go back to my last ENT (which is pretty good it seems) and if I 'm lucky enough I 'm going to have a chronic sinusitis surgery and get rid of this thing forever. I 'll keep you updated.######Yea I kinda agree with you on that. The ENT I visisted outside this country said that I had two seperated problems, which was post nasal drip and Bad breath. I kinda told them that there was a connection between the two problems: The post nasal drip causes the bad breath, but he was like ``believe me, the smell is coming from the stomach ''. I have to be a real idiot to actually believe what he says. I feel like I got more knowledge than them but whatever. Maybe I should go back to my old ENT, at least he said it was the mucus causing the smell. unfortenately he has n't been able to help me. I did the allergy test a few months ago. I only have seasonal allergy (not hayfever though), so have absolutely no idea why I got post nasal drip 365 days a year. That 's actually why I created this topic. Maybe there 's no cause, that kinda means I 'm screwed for the rest of my life. Getting yourself tested for allergies is n't really goin to help much because sometimes the things you 're allergic to is in your daily environment. It is impossible to avoid it. Just wondering how are you planning on getting him to do a chronic sinisitus surgery if u do n't have one ??######That ENT ordered an xray of my sinuses in one of my visits. I did it and it showed mucus thickening in my sinuses (not sure if I translated right, English is not my main language) and he said that this results in frequent sinus infections. But normally this would result in ups and downs in my bb, post nasal drip, pharyngitis (chronic as well) and all the other symptoms but since its always the same (just getting worse very slowly) I guess it 's just one infection that doesnt go away (= chronic). All I need to do is to visit him and have a CT scan to get a detailed image of the problem. I 'm pretty positive because this ENT is the most talkative and helpful person I ever met Not something you see on a doc every day The fact that you can be allergic to your every day environment doesnt mean anything. You can still take some medication that will reduce the problem and also you can cauterize your turbinates so they dont block your nose (if they do) so the mucus runs through your nose and not down your throat. I remember an ENT told me that it 's an allergic reaction that makes your turbinates to swell so they cauterize them to prevent them to swell. Also, make sure to have a full check up. Sometimes health problems come from where you dont expect them. Have a blood test, urine/stool test whatever is needed. Have your colon checked and have colon cleanses. Do you ever have problems with bowel movements? Abdominal pains? Intestinal pains? Go to a gastroenterologist and have yourself checked. Sounds too much of work to do, but do you wish to stay with this problem forever? Personally, I would do whatever it takes to get rid of it. Btw, how old are you?######No other problems, just post nasal drip and always a bad taste in my mouth and throat that makes me want to vomit. I can really taste it when I breath through my mouth with my mouth closed. I 'm still a teenager, I 've tried every possible anti-allergy medicine out there, but none reduced the problem. I do n't think it 's allergies causing post nasal drip and according to the CT-Scan there is n't an infection either. Btw I pretty much know a lot about BB and post nasal drip. I 've seen in some post you explained everything in detail, I thought I 'd maybe save you some time in the future with typing by telling you this, unless you do n't mind explaining it in detail.######Busted2- There are two other things that could cause post nasal drip/bad breath: 1- food intolerance and 2- candida. If you are intolerant to wheat for instance and you 're eating it every day, you 'd have constant post nasal drip and sinus infections. If you have candida, you 'd have a lot of congestion, sinus trouble and post nasal drip. I 've read of a case where a girl had horrific breath, the kind that could be smelled across a room. Turns out she was lactose intolerant and once dairy was removed from her diet, her breath cleared 100%. I read of another case where a woman's breath was like rotting corpses. They treated her with anticandida diet and supplements and within 3 months her breath cleared. If ENT's and xrays indicate no trouble in your nasal or oral areas, you might look at these as potential causes.######But I hardly eat any dairy products or sugar products. I hardly eat eggs, never drink milk, never eat yoghurt, no ice cream, no cookies, no cakes... This whole thing is extremely frustrating... Especially when you 're in public or at school you see everyone having conversations without worrying about having BB, you do n't feel normal. I 'm really depressed about this whole thing.######Busted- My ENT, the best in my city, said to avoid sinus surgery since candida/fungus is the root cause of sinus/post nasal drip/bad breath. This has been scientifically proven recently by researchers, check the web.) He suggested reading The Yeast Connection. Good luck.######You mean candida/fungus on tongue? That 's very rare among bad breath sufferers. Most of them have nothing but sinus problems. I had a saliva test and they found no candida nor nothing else.######Noptical- You said this is your 5th ENT. Did the other ENT's you visisted say there was something wrong with your sinuses when they looked into your nose with that scope thing ?? Your 5th ENT did say you might have chronic sinusitus after you done the X-ray. I 'm guessing the other 4 you visited said your sinuses were clean and ok and did n't even send you out to do a X-ray ??######1 & 2 said I have nothing (did n't do any tests at all to check for sinusitis just looked into my nostrils) and said that I should change my diet (they pretty much told me not to do what I already do n't do) like I 'm 60yo or something... (I 'm only 18 and on a pretty good diet). 3rd said that post nasal drip is caused by my deviated septum but told me that I should n't be operated unless it really annoys me. I told me it causes me bb but he said no, its just your stress/anxiety little did he know that bb is what causes me all the problems... 4th said again that PND is caused by my deviated septum and that we should fix it. He just looked into my nose with some light or something, never done any CT scans to see how deviated it is... So he fixed my septum (surgery was on 21st march 2006) but still nothing. He did n't seem to know anything about bb and he said that I probably do n't have anything with my sinuses since I do n't have the usual symptoms (constant headache etc). My nose gets blocked from time to time and when I go out the mucus flow gets like 10x more than usual for a few minutes (so much that sometimes I can hardly breath. I 'll be having allergy tests soon. 5th ENT seemed to be the most knowledgable about my issues and we had a few tests done (xray, saliva test, checked my sinuses with an endoscopic camera etc) and I was also on antibiotics for a while. So after doing the allergy test I 'm going to visit him again and see what happens. Will keep you updated of course.######Well you seem to have the same symptoms as me. I also only have pnd and bb, no headaches or anything. The mucous I usually spit out is white colored like milk and I can hardly blow my nose either. I 'm 18 too, had my septum fixed too on February 9th 2006, but it did n't change anythin. The ENT told me this before the surgery, but I had to try it anyways. I live in Belgium and it looks like no ENT has the real knowledge here to deal with my situation.######Well then you need to find the source of your PND. You need to have a full health check up since you have ruled out sinus infections and allergies. Sometimes health problems come from where you do n't expect them. Ever heard of iridoscopy/iridology? I recently was told about this and I 'm considering doing an iridoscopy too. In a few words, they say that the iris represents the whole body's health and with an iridoscopy they can determine which part's of your body ``malfunction ''. Search the net for it, it may help you.######Hi, I thought I would jump in. I too suffer from chronic post nasal drip (15 years now), bad breath and chronic sore throat from all the mucus running down my throat all day long. I went to the ENT twice in the last 9 months.He scoped up my nose and down my throat to my vocal cords twice.Says everything looks fine, but my turbinates are inflamed, thus causing the PND. I am a smoker who quit a few weeks ago, but then again there are smokers who have no PND, so I dont know if it was the cause.Just wanted to let you know your not alone.There are lots of sufferers out there.My father has it, my mother has it, my brother has it and now I have it.Could it be genetic?######Could be genetic, but I doubt it cause I 'm the youngest kid in the family and I 'm the only unlucky one. Actually I do not really mind the pnd, but there are people out there who have pnd and do n't suffer from bb at all. And i doubt there are millions who suffer from the same problem, cause I would at least have met one so far. I noticed there is a smell coming from my nose too cause in class everyone around me starts coughing. This is madness, if I ca n't even breath through my nose, I die for sure.######Yeah me too, I 'm the youngest in the familty (18) and the only one who has all these problems. Yes there 's usually a smell from the nose (have your sinuses checked again by another ENT, did you have a CT scan?) . And yes, many people who have PND do n't have bb. I read somewhere that when you have a sinus infection, mucous gets mixed with pus and runs down your throat and mouth and thus causing you bb.######Yes done the ct-scan, only showed that I had a small deviuated septum. I kinda had to ask my ENT if I could do one, he kept saying it was n't neccesary and I do n't have an infection. I doubt that CT-scans are 100% reliable. But yeah I ca n't seem to convince any ENT that there 's something wrong with my post nasal drip. He does n't really want to help me cause the last time I visited him he wanted me to go away and he was \*\*\*\*\*\* that I asked him to do a CT-scan and the results did n't show any infection.######Screw him, he 's clueless. Go find another one.######I completely know what you mean and how you are feeling. Gosh I mean when I walk by people in the hallway or when I get close to someone I have to hold my breath. Post nasal drip is so lame. I know it 's my problem and causing my bad breath and so far I have n't had much luck... I 'm getting tested for allergies soon (I hope). There 's no way I 'm going to go another year like this... I wo n't do it. I will definetly die if not from being deprived of oxygen. lol.######Yea i wish there was someone I could talk that understands what I 'm goin through. I do n't mean someone on the internet but just in real life. I do n't get any support at all. I ca n't stand the fact that everyone around me is having a normal life and I have to keep my mouth shut all day. I know they just do n't give a \*\*\*\* about me. I 'll definately go crazy if this keeps goin on for another month or two.######It will keep going if YOU let it keep going. Instead of reading this post you should be looking for a new ENT######Yeah same here I wish there was someone around here I could talk to. I wish I had just about anything but this. My ENT doctor has helped me but we have n't found any solution. I do n't think my family takes this seriously my dad knows everything, why he does n't seem to help me, support me, I do n't know but this is all very deppressing maybe he does n't know how severe it is. I 'm changing my diet completely. I do n't think it will help but I 'm going to have faith. I 'm going to trust God is going to help me with this.######What are you goin to do if the CT-scan shows u have no infection in your sinuses at all? Visit another ENT who will let you do the CT-scan again with the same result? I 'm telling you there 's no way he will do the Chronic sinisitus surgery. I know that CT-Scans are n't 100% reliable. Maybe you can wait another 10 years till the infection is bad enough for them to notice. That 's what chuckwho did. Or you could fight the infection yourself without any help of an ENT and that 's exactly what I have in mind.######The xray showed mucosal thickening and sinus infection and he also said that I 'm very prone to sinus infections because of my situation. He said the only way to get rid of this is to clean my sinuses and since fixing my septum didnt fix this problem, the only way to do it is to clean it manually (= sinus surgery). Now even if sinusitis & PND arent the reasons (which I 'm pretty certain they are) I do n't know, but I 'm going to visit every doc on this planet, be it a gastroenterologist or pope of rome. I 'm fed up with this and I 'm going to do everything that 's humanly possible to get rid of it. I 'm not planning to live with this my whole life. Have you ever though what 's so special with us, bb sufferers? Why we have to brush x10 times our teeth/ day? Why do we have to watch our diet? Why do we have to use special products for our breath that do n't help anyway? Why do we have to chew gum all the time (same as previous)? Why should we watch this and that? I 'm still 18 dam it and most old people with$$ & \*$ & rotten teeth have no bb. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS NOT NORMAL. Most people in this hopeless world can brush their teeth once in a few days and still have 5x better breath than we! I do n't really understand why you give up so easy anyway... It 's like you take your illness (yes its an illness) for granted. Like, this is how you was born and your condemned to live like that for you whole life? I did n't tell you to go to a different ENT to have another CT scan but to look for another solution since your previous and current docs were unable to do so.######Yeah I know this is not a normal situation especially when you just see everyone around u talk without havin to worry about there breath at all. That 's actually why I 'm so \*\*\*\*\*\* every day. My parents are like: ``Stop actin like u got a serious problam, you do n't have one ''. It drives me nuts. I know I 'm not in a normal situation. Otherwise I could just go talk to ppl and make friends. There 's no doubt that I have pnd. I never noticed this untill someone here told me. I spit out a lot of white colored mucous. I 'm pretty sure your mucous is also white colored and so is crossmyheart's. So my ENT's are definately wrong if they think the mucous has to be green, yellow colored if there 's an infection. You 're lucky you 've found an ENT who 's willin to help you. Even if there 's no infection found in your sinuses, I would ask him to think about the result. Maybe it 's an infection the CT-scan can not detect. So during the surgery the ENT will see that you were right and CT-scans are n't 100% reliable. What country do you live in? Do they have a lot of modern stuff over there like the USA and Canada. I kinda feel like the ENT's in this country just wo n't be able to help me since they lack the knowledge. Maybe I 'll visit one somewhere over there one day, maybe they can help me. These ENT's just refuse to believe me that there 's connection between pnd and bb.######I live in a small city in Greece and trust me, its not like we have the most advanced equipment here :P It 's all about finding a GOOD DOC, it does n't matter if it is in USA, Germany or Zibabwe. I 'm going to say again that this is the 5th ENT that I visited the previous looked at me strangely when I told them about bb and PND. It just happens that the last one is VERY talkative and you do n't need to ``squeeze '' out every bit of information off of him (if you know what I mean). Most of people think the same about the docs in their country. Check the ``bb has changed my personality '' threads. Most of sufferers are from US and Canada and still looking for a solution. So its not about the country you live in, its all about THE DOC. All you have to do is to go to another doc and tell him your problem. Change docs until you find the right one. A little talk with him about your problem will give you an idea about his knowledge regarding this issue. Also, as a last resort, I heard there is a ``bad breath '' department in one of the public hospitals in thessaloniki (the 2nd biggest city in greece, kind of... unusual for a public hospital to have such departments). For now I have to wait for the allergy test and then I 'll visit my ENT.######You 're right noptical, you 've really encouraged me to fight this problem and get rid of it once and for all. Thanks a lot. They have got one of those departments here too. My ENT was goin to sent me there because he says he ca n't help me with the BB problem. Maybe they will be able to help me. I had a fight with my parents today. They were very mad at me. Maybe I should explain it. I usually avoid having contact with anyone, cause I 'm afraid they will know I have got BB. So usually when someone asks me somethin I just nod my head (yes or no) or I say it with one hand in front of my mouth. My parents want me to talk to people face to face just like the people who do n't suffer from bb. I know I ca n't do this, but now it looks like I have no other choice. They even said somethin about me bein the worst son ever and stuff. Well i do understand why they are sayin this, cause they must be very disappointed at me. Man I really wish I never had pnd and bb. I 've already told them about my bb problem but they refuse to believe that this thing has changed me personality completely. What would you do in these kind of situations ?? I 'm really afraid to make friends cause I 'm afraid they will make fun of me. Back in the days I did n't know I had this problem yet, my friends did make fun of me, well some of them. Ever since I moved to Belgium I stopped makin friends. Do your friends make fun of you or ignore or hate you ??######Well luckily (since I live in the same area since I was pretty much a kid), no, I have enough friends and no, they are n't making fun of me although they seem to be throwing (just a couple of them) ``innuendos '' about my bb every now and then, but overall, no they have no problem with that and that 's maybe because I also do n't speak very closely to them and try to cover it as much as I can (frequent brushing- both teeth and tongue-, therabreath- helps a little-, drinking lots of water and chewing gum all the time). People tend to accuse people suffering from bb because they think it 's our fault (bad hygiene etc) but as they find out the real reason (I was throwing... uhm lets say very light innuendos to some of my friends so they know that its a health problem and not a hygiene issue since its kind of embarassing to talk about directly, and they seem to understand it) they become more tolerate and more understanding. This problem really affected me psychologically. As I discovered over they years that I have this problem, I have become more and more isolated. I prefer to stay at home, alone, and mind my own business instead of going out and socializing. And, believe me, that 's not how I really am. Its just sometimes I think how cool it would be to go out and hang out etc and then I remember my bb... so I say, nah%$ &$ it... another time. However I try to be as sociable as possible. I 'm not going to let this illness drive me crazy. Parents are a lost case, trust me. Sometimes I think that if I do n't have a terminal disease, they 're not going to take me to a doctor. Thankfully, I am 18 now and I can decide myself but since I am not economically indipendent yet, they have to help me. Since I very well know my parent's character and way of thinking, having numerous similar encounters with them about similar issues (not necessarily health issues), I did n't risk it this time. I did n't tell them about bb. Remember, since most people do n't understand you problem- not even ENTs- how will your parents who are prejudiced about everything that relates to their son? (not sure if you understand what I mean). I had to think a smarter solution... So I told it them about PND and sinus infections. Basically what I told them about PND is that it makes me sick in my stomach by irritating it (I have a little sensitive stomach to some foods)- that may also be true-. I also told them that all that mucus makes it hard to breath (sometimes true) and it gives me a weird taste in my mouth (sometimes true although I do n't know if pnd is the cause). About sinus infections I told them basically what I read somewhere on the net (if chronic sinusitis is left untreated it can lead to meningitis etc). So in other words, what you need to do is to OVERREACT a little bit. You know you are right and do n't let your parents to stop you from being cured. It 's not their life. It YOUR's. Be more aggressive. Do n't give your parents much freedom. Do n't say ``ma! I think that pnd causes me problems, maybe I should go to the doctor? '' . Say instead ``Mom! I have problem, I will go to a doctor and I need money '' or something like that. This is what I do. And yes, they told me ``you 're the worst son '' many many times. Yet I help them and support much more than my brother and sister. This is how parents are and do n't try to change them. Been there, done that, failed. I 've fought with them many times because instead of going out, I prefered sitting home surfing the net or watching tv. They say that I 'm becoming unsociable and all that cr \* p. If they only knew... If you work and are somehow economically independent. Do n't say a word. Go to any doc you want. It 's your health, not theirs. And since you have such a department, I say visit it right away. You have nothing to lose. Do n't give a da \* n about everything anyone says. I know, I 'm going through all this too. Take care.######We totally know what your going through so hang in there. We 're going to figure this out. There is doubt about it. We are going to find our solution ~ cure than later. I 'm just trying to keep a positive attitude (which is hard of course) and I 'm continuing to find out what 's causing my pnd.######It 's no doubt a sinus infection. I heard that if post nasal drip is caused by allergies it contributes really only little to the smell. The problem most of us have is that our sinus infections are very mild and not serious enough for ENT's to care about or for CT-scans to show up. Chuckwho who got cured from this whole thing had to wait 30 years before there was an ENT who eventually saw that he had an infection. During the surgery the ENT was very surpirsed how bad the infection was. which means it has gotten worse over the ages. Now I 've done a CT-scan and the results did n't show an infection or anything, but in maybe 20 years they probably will.######You 're not going to wait 20 years do you? :P I wonder if they can detect sinus infections in some way other than a CT scan...######I wo n't even last 20 years. I can hardly live another day with this problem. THERE IS ANOTHER WAY. Soon I will be victorious... They say sinus infections are very stubborn. They are very hard to take care of. Well that 's nice cause I 'm very stubborn too. We 'll see who 's more stubborn, me or the infection.######thats great that you know whats causing your problem. lucky you######Yeah I recall hearing somewhere (I think some TV show about sinusitis) that they only way to completely get rid of sinusitis is sinus surgery.######crossmyheart < 3, if you post nasal drip is caused by allergies there 's got to be some sort of sinus infection in there that makes you have bad breath. If post nasal drip is caused by allergies only you should not have bad breath. Besides people with allergies are more prone to sinus infections. Chuckwho had chronic sinusitus, but he had none of the symptons such as headache, toothpain,... He only had post nasal drip and bad breath. He also said his mucous was very gluey and clear too and not green or yellow which it should be when you have sinus infection. So it 's no doubt that it 's a special kind of sinus infection that we have. We 've got this stuff all solved, the only problem is to find a good ENT which you have to convince to believe you.######BUSTED2 I have some questions for you (trying to compare my case with yours): Is your bb always the same or is it better when you 're at home (after your brushed teeth/tongue)? Does it become much worse when you go out? (after some time) Do you feel a little bit dryness (or a similar feeling) mostly in the very back of the tongue too (again, when you go out). Do you have chronic sore throat? (I mostly feel it when I wake up in the morning). Thanks######It 's always the same, I always get reactions when I talk. It has been like this since the day I was born. I would n't know cause I never go out, but it 's probably the same. I do not feel any dryness at all, just the post nasal drip that keep dripping down which I have to spit out every 5 min. In the mornings the mucous in my throat has a yellow color. It 's from the pnd that stays there for too long. It 's no doubt infected.######So do you guys have an excess amount of post-nasal drip?######Yea we all do crossmyheart < 3. As you can read in my other posts the mucous is usually clear with white spots in it and very sticky. Do you have to spit out mucous into a tissue every 2 min. like me ??######Yes what BUSTED2 said although I do n't have to spit any mucous (although I feel like there is some in my saliva sometimes) it just goes down my throat.######When I think about it I 'm not really sure if I have alot of pnd or not. I know it 's thick and it also sometimes gets into my saliva but I do n't have to spit it out. Oohh except I do have to spit in the morning when im brushing my teeth & & at night.######Hey Busted, dont be so hard on yourself, Your not alone, I know you want to get better and thats all you care about, and you will, its not rocket science you will eventually figure it out, and your parents are acting like you dont have a problem because, they dont experience it themsleves so they dont see how its possible, its kinda of a self centered point of view for them, but thats how some people are. It would be nice to have validation from your family and friends and not be put down for somthing you have no control over. That is the most frusterating part. And feeling lousy all the time doesnt help. I think this mucus thing is really affecting your self esteem and you need to make some good friends, or a good friend, and they are out there. Hey im in columbus ohio a little far away but id be your pal, cause I can totally relate to your situation believe it or not. I have had chronic PND, and Bad breath for 2 years now, all my CT scans are normal, and no infections, no allergies, so my dr dx me with vasomotor rhinitis, and gave me sprays. didnt work, tired diets didnt work, I felt so lousy, cause I have to hack up mucus every five min too, And espically after i eat or drink anything, and its thick and gelatious like, like snot. I get headaches too, and exptreme facial pain and jaw pain, and im alwyas hacking. Pelple have made fun of me for hacking and spitting up phlegm and said ohh gross. your gross. and as a lady it doesnt make me feel very attractive. My parents have dismissed me, the irony is that my father is an ENT surgon, and my mother is a nurse, and I think that is why they think im a nut. My father told me he thinks im a hypochondriac and to get over it, and my mother doesnt want to hear about it, shes sick of hearing about it. They both think I should just get over it. But I dont blame them for being insensitive its hard to know how miserable it is unless you really experience it for yourself. I wouldnt want my mom or dad to have the mucus probs tho. Doctors are very bad listeners anyway, and my dads basically a dick, but I love him anyway. Have you tried somthing called sinus buster,,, look it up online, its supposed to stop mucus, also the drug Trental is an experiemtal drug that had a offlable side effect of supressing mucus. Youd have to get a prescription, I tried it and my mucus dried up a lot. but I got headaches after that, but I also have thyroid problems that cause my mucus,,,,,, you prob dont have a thyroid problem. Natural doctors are more understanding also,,,,, Hang in there sweetie, your just a kid. im only 25 years old and im studying to become a nurse,,,, i dont really care what pepople think anymore, I work in a hospital and im around sick people all day,,,, and a lot of them have mucus, and PND cause I work on an otolaryngology surgery floor, a lot of them are miserable and feel alone too. Some days I myself feel so scared and depressed that this will never go away, like im out of control of my body, and I want to just drive my car into a telephone poll on the way home... but then I have the good days,,, I have a purpose and it is to heal others, and myself, and as one of my patients pointed said ``if there was any way to escape we 'd do it, this prison of the body. '' The body does heal,, you just have to figure out whats wrong and fix it. As of now what the doctor will try to do is treat the symptoms. Try maybe eliminating dairy, it causes a lot of excess mucus, and so can gluten... U will figure this out! P.S. 2 ENTs is nothing !!! surgery on a deviated septum has nothing to do with PND. Its more likley a fungus, or a systemic immune problem or somthing creating imflammation in your nose, and hypersensitivy. Could be Laryngeal Phanengeal Reflux. Had your thryoid checked lately? The point is you sometimes have to rule things out, to find the cause. Have they given you antibiotics yet, im sure they have,,, Christina######Well, apparently my ENT wants to help me cause he 's goin to send me to a multi-disciplined team (dentists, ENT's, psychiatrists, ...) who try to help you getting rid of the bb. I told him that this is causing me major depression and stuff. I 'm not really sure if they can help me but I 'm hopin they can. I 'm especially hopin that those psychiatrists are really special ones and know what a person with bb thinks and does. I use to be really shy about it. I never talked to anyone about it, but if I think about it, it is n't really my fault. I mean I go to the dentist 3 times a year and he always says there nothing wrong and everything looks clean and stuff. I have never smoked one cigarette in my life or drank any alcohol. I see people walkin around with rotten teeth like noptical said and still have no bad breath. Though I still find it very humiliating when I see reactions. I think even if I got rid of the bb, it still takes a lot of time for me to talk to someone. Well I 'll try to keep u guys updated on how things go over there.

He said you have chronic sinusitis but did you mention anything about you having chronic sinusitis before? I know he told you to do a xray of your sinuses. When will you be doin the CT-scan and the chronic sinusitis surgery? Btw how did the allergy test go? is it allergies causing your pnd? Does the allergy test include food allergies ?? Sorry for all the questions, but I have no idea what I should tell the multidisciplined team. I ca n't just go there and tell them ``I 'm pretty certain I have chronic sinusitis and that 's the cause of my bb. I would really like to do a chronic sinusitis surgery ''. I 'm pretty sure they ask questions about the CT-scan and stuff, I 'll have to say there 's no infection and stuff; but I doubt the CT-scan is 100% reliable. Man I 'm hopin I do n't have to play the doctor myself and they find the cause of my pnd.######BUSTED2, I havent done the allergy test nor I have gone to the ENT because I have final exams and I 'm studying hard. Exams finish at 3rd June so I will start visiting docs again... I did n't tell my doc anything other than that I have bad breath with no cause and I also have mucus running in the back of my throat instead of through my nose. I told him that I ruled pretty much everything else and the only thing left is nose, sinuses etc.. And he just ordered the xray and after I got the results he told me all that stuff I mention in my previous posts in this thread. Do the same. Tell them that you have ruled out everything else and let them concentrate on your sinuses/nose/throat whatever. They probably know what to do. As you said, do n't play the doc, docs hate that :P Just tell them that you researched a lot on the net and many sufferers have chronic sinusitis as the main cause etc. and just ask them ``is that true? '' . And see what they answer. Do n't tell them things. Ask them things you already now the answer for. Just give hints. Good luck. AND do n't forget to ask them about that white stuff on your tongue and tell them that you have a weird taste in your mouth. They will order a saliva test. Your saliva is probably normal, but you never know, you may have candida or whatever. Just do it so you can rule this out too. You have nothing to lose anyways.######BUSTED2, any updates?######No, appointment is on 6th October. I doubt that they will help me. They probably just give tips and products. I 'm not even goin to bother takin the products. I 'm lookin for someone who can help me cure my problem, not products that can mask it for an hour or so. Besides there 's no product out there who can mask the smell, I think I 've never had fresh breath in my entire life before. I 'm definately screwed for the rest of my life. All I can do now is hope I wo n't live for too long.######Meanwhile, you can check another ENT since October is pretty far. Oh and, do n't be so pessimistic: P######Plz keep me updated after u have done that sinus surgery.######Hi Guys, ive been following this thread since i stumbled over it last week. I suffer from extremely bad post nasal drip and bad breath. Like you guys, ive tried every product known to man and have had my cries for help constantly dismissed by my doctor. I am getting to the point that im starting to feel that there is no hope for me to ever be cured and to feel normal. I try not to breathe near people becuase my breath is foul all day. I feel like that when i breathe i am polluting the air and that people can definatley smell it. This is made even worse by working in an office and having to interact closely with people. Its effecting my mental health because it makes me quite depressed at times. I think it has also affected my personality because i am no longer outgoing and i like to keep to myself alot. I never used to be like this when i was younger and didnt realize i had post nasal drip and bad breath. To make matters work i have another problem where my mouth salivates excessively at times when i am most conscious about my breath. This is extrememly frustrating having to swallow constanty and at the same time try to mask bad odours when i am talking to people. I have no explanation for this salivation problem and it has been dismissed by the doctors that i have tried to ask for help. All i know is that it is directly related to my bad breath at certain times of the day. Scraping the thick white mucous off my toungue every morning and night is a fruitless exercise because no matter what i have foul breath caused by my extremely bad post nasal drip. I really dont know what to do... i want to live a normal life and i want fresh breath but i believe it can only be achieved by eliminating my post nasal drip, and i just dont know how to do this ?! i can really relate to much of what you guys have been posting and i just thought id share my problems with you. Maybe you could offer any tips or advise. Im willing ot try anything !!######halfback, about the excessive saliva problem, are you sure it 's saliva? It may be saliva mixed with PND (many people who have bad PND spit out mucus). Also, I 'm sure excessive saliva is better than dry mouth since saliva is supposed to kill the bacteria and clean your teeh/mouth And here 's some advice: read my posts carefully in this thread and do what I did. PND can be a symptom of an allergy, check the allergies subforum. Have you had any allergy tests, CT scans, xrays or whatever? How many ENTs you visited and what did each of them say? I 'm having my first allergy test 6th June and the second a few days later. Will post results when I 'll have them.######I think noptical is right. It 's not excess saliva, but excess mucous you keep swallowing. Noptical, when are you goin to visit your ENT again? Just wonderin, why you do an allergy test if you 're ENT has already said you have chronic sinusitis. :P Even if you know what you 're allergic to, the ENT will only prescribe you some medicines to reduce symptoms. Usually there is n't one specific sort of medicine for what you 're allergic to. I 've tried everythin from Allegra to Zyrtec. Nothin stopped the PND. Btw have you read all chuckwho's posts. You should read that he had to irrigate his nose 6 times a day for one week after the surgery to get rid of the infection. And at the beginning the ENT's he visited did n't notice an infection, but he had those nasal polyps which the CT scan could show. I think that 's why the ENT suspected there was an infection in there. But only during the operation the ENT could see how badly it was infected. You still thinkin about askin your ENT to do the Chronic Sinusitis surgery chuckwho did? I think he would do the surgery since he already said you have it. It 's weird how a sinus xray can show you have an infection. I really thought u needed a ct-scan but whatever. Maybe if u do the ct-scan it will not show an infection. I just thought of somethin crazy. If I saw someone who had the same problem as me I would notice it immediately. I 've been talkin with my hand in front of my mouth, turning my head away from people for years, and yet no one knows I do this because of bb. I wo n't be able to do anythin for weeks. Way too busy, same thing that kept you from visiting your ENT and doctor. Yea, I do n't really see what the point is, but somehow I do want to pass this year. Unfortenately it 's not very easy when you 're on your own, while others can count on their friends to help them pass. Who said life's very fair: S. Nah it blows to be honest.######sinusitis can be a caused by allergies. I have my first allergy test on 6th June and the second a few days later. After getting the results I 'm visiting my ENT again. Yes I read all of his posts and I 've been irrigating 4 to 6 times a day after the surgery. Did n't help but helped the mucus (and blood) come out. I 'm still irrigating 1time/day. I 'm not going to ask him to do it but I 'll try to make him look more into it and suggest it himself. The xray showed mucosal thickening and a lot of mucus in my sinuses, that 's what both the doc and the xray result (not sure how is that paper that says the diagnosis of xray called) said. My ENT didnt tell me that I have chronic sinusitis but he said that I 'm very prone to frequent infection and I might have developed chronic sinusitis. I will let you know after I visit him again. By the way, what did your allergy results say? Good luck with your exams. One last exam left for me. I probably will not pass to the university I want. I was n't studying that hard this year, really. All that depression, obviously caused by bb, makes me want to sit all day and do nothing, I just do n't want to do anything anymore damn it. I just sit and wonder how different my life would be if I had n't this problem, I 'm sure I would be a better student and wouldnt waste this year too Even if I pass to a uni I 'm sure as hell not going if I wo n't get rid of this problem completely. \*\*\*\* it.######I 've only done the scratch allergy test, only certain allergies such as hayfever, dustmites and all that stuff was included in it. I was allergic to some tree stuff, not sure what it is called in english. But I 'm think I 'm goin to get myself tested for other allergies such as food allergies too. I 'm goin to convince my ENT to do the sinus surgery. There 's probably some bacteria in there the CT-scan has n't shown or else the post nasal drip wo n't lead to bad breath. Besides I heard my ENT say that mucous is suppose to run down the throat, it 's the natural path, but most normal people swallow it unconsciously and if my mucous is n't infected, how come they do n't suffer from bad breath and I do. This thing is goin to end, either in a negative or positive way.######Your postnasal drip is thick right? That 's the difference between the two. You do n't have to have an infection to have bad breath because of postnasal drip. I do n't have sinus problems but I suffer from bad breath because of the postnasal drip. (its thick) so have you gone online and searched everything about postnasal drip? Because I can asure you, you dont have to have an infection to have bad breath its a fact because I live it. It has to do with bacteria and the protiens in the mucus and because it 's thick it doesnt go smoothly down. There is so much stuff online, the problem that I have that we all have is finding the cause of the pnd and then solving the problem! eeerg lol its a crazy process and its horrific but what else can we do?######I do n't think it 's only the thick mucus, but it 's also the huge amount of mucus that can block your sinuses and lead to an infection.######Defintion of pnd is: The feeling that it is accumulating in the throat or dripping from the back of your nose, mucus normally is swallowed unconsciously. Post-nasal drip occurs when excessive mucus is produced by the sinuses. The excess mucus accumulates in the throat or back of the nose. It can be caused by rhinitis, sinusitis, or laryngopharyngeal acid reflux. To be honest I do n't feel like any mucous accumlating in the back of the throat. I just know I have pnd because when I spit out mucous that had the same color as the mucous I blow out of my nose. Plus the back of my tongue is always white even after I cleaned it and it tastes horrbile back there. I highly doubt that postnasal drip only will lead to bad breath. How come the mucous we produce is full of proteins while the mucous from others do n't have it at all. I got myself tested for allergies, only allergic to some tree stuff (seasonal allergy). I think I 'm very prone to infections too. There 's still some infection stuff in there cause my sinuses have never been really cleaned. I just think I have a really special kind of infection like chuckwho, cause usually people have thick yellow mucous plus symptoms such as headaches, toothpain. Chuckwho said he never had any of the symptoms, only bad breath. Btw crossmyheart, I 've read in one of your posts where you asked if tonsillitis can cause pnd, but should n't it be pnd causing tonsillitis. This seems to make much more sense to me. It 's kinda strange you say that you have postnasal drip, but do n't suffer from any sinus problems. Post nasal drip is a sinus problem. What do people irrigate their sinuses for, it 's to get temporary relief from pnd.######Yeah, my ENT said I had tonsillitis. But I do n't, I told him I thought it was the pnd causing inflamed red tonsils and I guess he agreed he did n't say too much about it. So I do n't have tonsillitis, never did. I do n't have any sinus problems either so I have no clue why I have thick post nasal drip that causes bad breath. My mucus is only clear its not white or yellow or anything. There 's not much I can do. I 've done the allergy testing, I 've taken food out of my diet, I 've gotten my sinuses looked at................... everyth ing has been done so I 'm stuck once again lol. Oh and irrigating doesnt do anything for me... ohh and neither does rhinitis meds. I wanted to get tested for acid reflux because I have more symptoms to that but my ent said my larynx was clear.######So it 's not the foods you 're allergic to that are causing the post nasal drip? I 'm not sure if the post nasal drip we have can really be called post nasal drip. The only symptoms of it is bad breath. I do n't even have sore throat. Do you? Even if we do n't have post nasal drip, there will still be some mucous running down into the stomach, cause it 's the natural path of it. This will lead to bad breath too, cause there 's got to be something wrong with the mucous the sinuses produce. If the mucous is normal, the bacteria in our mouth wo n't be able feed themself with it and cause the smell. If not then everyone in this world would have bad breath. So the problem has to be in the sinuses.######crossmyheart < 3, If you really want to check out acid reflux as a cause, you should see a Gastroenterologist. I had an endoscopy that showed no signs of acid. I still had symptoms though of a chronic cough that allergy and ashtma treatments did n't help. Then I had a 24 hour PH test and manometry done. Turns out I had ``silent '' reflux with acid in my throat and esophogus 25-35% of the day-- depending on whether or not I was eating. Just because they ca n't visually see the acid does n't mean it is n't there. My meds were increased to taking a PPI twice a day and I altered my diet. Seems to be helping some. My symptoms have decreased.######@BUSTED2 I did n't know I had sore throat too until my ENT told me that I have chronic sore throat so having that in mind I noticed that I really did after some time. Mucus is supposed to irritate your throat and cause sore throat.######No, aparently I 'm not allergic to any foods. I have all the symptoms of postnasal drip, like a feeling of mucus in the back of my throat, white coating on tounge, bad breath (duh lol), congestion. I do get sore throats on occasion relating to the pnd because I find myself swallowing constantly to get rid of the mucus in turn my throat gets irritated. Everyone has pnd, some people just have more, some less. I just do n't get how I could have a sinus problem when I 've been looked at everyway possible.######@BUSTED I just read at some site that MRI is mostly used for detection of fungal sinusitis. I guess that means that it can detect fungal sinusitis better than a CT scan? Maybe that 's the reason your CT scans show nothing?######@noptical uhh could you explain that in detail? What is MRI btw? Is that the sinus xray you done?######No it 's not the xray I 've done (btw I also read that the xray can be used to detect chronic sinusitis but the CT scan is more effective or something like that). MRI scan is something like a CT scan, it scans tissue for abnormalities but it does not use multiple x-rays like the CT scan but a magnetic field instead. Search \*\*\*\* pedia or google for Magnetic Resonance Imaging for details. There are cases where CT is more effective than MRI and vice versa but I 'm no doc so you better search the net for details. The machine is kind of similar to the CT scan but bigger, its like a huge pipe where they put you in and the procedure lasts around 30 mins. I 've done an MRI scan a week before the deviated septum surgery so my doc can check it (I had and still have a low volume ringing in my ear 24/7, its called tinnitus and it was a brain MRI scan so it doesnt have to do with our problem). Before doing the MRI scan I was shocked when I read everywhere on the net that an MRI scan can cost from 2000$ to 3000$. But it seems this is how it is in US because I paid only 240? for the scan plus 105? for an injection the use on you so they highlight some points in the resulting MRI result image, not sure how its called. My insurance covered almost everything (100% of scan, 75% of that injection fluid)######Hi everyone, I have been reading your posts and i too have pnd and horrible bad breath. I havent have bb all of my life, it came when i was about 14 and i am 21 now. I have been searching the internet for cures and have found nothing. My symptoms are: bad breath, my ears pop all day, horrible taste in my mouth, my throat hurts, pnd, lump feeling in my throat, burns under neth where my ribs part, white on back of my tongue, and large taste buds on back of my tongue. I had my tonsils out so i know it is not that. I also had a ct scan and it showed nothing. I have not been checked for allergys, however, about 1 month ago i went to my ENT and he scoped me and figured out that i have gerd/acid reflux. This can cause pnd... so he put me on nexium twice a day, however, this did nothign for my acid reflux nor my breath. I told him 2 weeks later it did nothing. I was then tested for h pylori and it came out negative. My ENT then sent me to a GI doctor and at the end of the month he is doing a 24 ph test and an endoscopy on me. An endoscopy is when he looks down my esph into my stomach area to see any red inflammation, hernias or ulcers. Now i have no idea if this can cause my bad breath, i was assuming that the acid coming back into my mouth is what is causing the bb. I was just putting this out there bc it may not be your sinus... you should have your ENT scope you its very quick (they just stick a scope down your nose into your throat and look. Now my bb is still here, but i am just getting very frusterated. I hoping i can overcome this and find out what is causing this. What exactly is a deviated semptum or whatever? Good luck######Nah my ENT already scoped me with that thing. It really hurt when he put that thing in my nose and looked really deep into my throat. He said everything is normal there. A deviated septum is what me and noptical had. It 's a physical disorder in your nose. I really had trouble breathing, especially at night when I was sleeping. I could n't blow my nose and it was always full of mucous. I can breathe better now and blow my nose after the septum surgery.######Ok, I just returned from the 1st of total 2 allergy tests. In this first phase I was tested for the types (or is groups the right word?) of allergies I have and on the second visit I will be tested which specific allergies I have from these types. So I am allergic to 5 types of allergies and each type has 8 allergies which means I have anywhere from 5 to 40 allergies My appointment for the second and last test is on 19th June and I will post results when I 'll be back.######i have all the symptoms of PND, BB, and coated tongue. I had deviated septum performed, nasal somnoplasty, allergies edand, as the result of being on so many anti-biotics, i am now allergic to penicillin; and still looking for a cure for BB. What exactly did Chuckwho had/surgery and has anyone heard from him and his progress?######I do n't know what surgery he had but I think its just called sinus surgery or chronic sinus surgery or something like that. I do n't think it has a special name. After the surgery he posted for a while and then disappeared. Most likely he does n't want to look back at his past and I understand him Read this whole thread carefully if you did n't do so already.######Hi, Noptical; Yes, I had read every single post, U know, just like you and just about every single one of us with BB has exhausted just about every possibilities of finding some alleviation, a cure is almost impossible, but alleviation is a realistic view of our delimma. I read that Thanastos said that, up until ChuckWho, no one was cured. However, in the mid 80's I was temperary cured of my BB. I used Lavoris Mouthwash with Zinc oxide and chloride. It was nothing short of a mericle. I was able to live a normal life for the first time in my life. Had a long-term relationship and life was a mericle. However, Lavoris Mouthwash went bankrupt and it was sold over to another company. They labled Lavoris with ``Zantrate ''. After that it no longer was effictive in curing my BB. I did a throughout research on the company and came up with that history. Today's Lavoris still uses Zinc in their mouthwas but somehow it 's not the same. I swear it cured my BB. I even called the company to ask them to use the old formula but they wo n't accumadate one person. Oh well. Somehow with a ``patented '' lable with Zantrate is a more profitable marketing strategy they employed. So Zinc does work in combating halitosis. If somehow we can turn back time and able to come up with one bottle of Lavorise to experiment on ALL OF US with BB. I beleive we would be probably abandoned spending time on the computer consoling with each others. We all would be makeing love with our significant other and living a odor free life. Maybe if we all emailed Lovoris to change their formula back to the orignal 1980's that would spark a movement. I swear it worked. We just need another person with BB to validate it efficacy. Oh well.######Well I guess here fits the ``if it works dont fix it '' saying But anyway, its still a temporary solution, it just cures the symptoms not the cause, which is what we want. If the odor comes from the nose too, no mouthwash can save us. We need to find out what is so different with us that makes us different than normal people.######U are right. But it at least allow us to live a relatively happy life without 24/7 BB. At this point if my BB was reduced by 50% all day I would embrace that as a mericle in my life. Half the suffering is better than nothing. I sure hope and pray that all of us whom are suffering from this nightmare awaken to a new life of hope, healing, and freedom. Where we can have relationships and fall in love, and if the relationship fails, at lease we know it was not because of our illness which we are powerless to do anything about it. I will see an ENT and push hard the issue of my nasal congestion and PND. Perhaps it is sinus infection that I am suffering from. ChuckWho was cured I pray we all may be cured as well. Thank you for listening.######Noptical you plan on fixing this whole problem this summer? I 'd recommend it cause it 's pretty stressful to start Uni with this problem. People are goin to say stuff like ``you 're not eighteen '' if u do n't talk to them. And if u talk there are always some people who make comments about it. This all happened to me. I hope you will have more luck than I had.######BUSTED2, yes I swear I 'm not going to uni if I wo n't fix this, I 'm sure as hell not going there. You are already in uni or just finished school? The problem is, that I normally talk a lot and am very sociable, but I try not to because of the bb and people sometimes think that I 'm unsociable... (eg. my parents) Actually I 'm planning to get rid of it completely before August (holidays). God I hope this will happen or I 'm screwed. @oceanside DO confront an ENT about it ASAP. Summer is coming I 'm sure you want to enjoy REAL holidays Do you think it is a coincidence that we all have PND, nasa congestion and all that cr \* p? I believe it 's the same thing that causes bb to all of us, or its just the biggest coincidence ever. In my case I think it has something to do with my allergies, because sometimes when I am at home, my bb is not that bad. Or maybe not bad at all. Anyways, I 'll know in 2 weeks.######Nop/Busted, yes, I have allergies all my life, PND, congestion, dry mouth, white coated tongue, all that and more. My sense of smell is so bad that I ca n't smell anything most of the time. You guys are entering college? My senior yr in collge my dormmate used to put me down alot b/c of my BB. We used to party during the wknd and when he was drunk made nasty comments ab my BB. It hurts, but I learn to turn the other checks. I hope you be cured this summer and I hope you will live a life filled with joy, laughters, and freedom from this nightmare. Why does colloidal silver work? Does it somehow kill off the sinus infection? I have so many questions but no answers.######I tried the silver, still got a bottle, but it does n't help. You can try it though, if ur lucky it might help. The funny thing is that lots of people there said it burned, but mine just feels like water and does n't burn at all. But it is n't goin to stop the post nasal drip, it may only help remove the smell a bit. But the best way to find out is to try it, like nopctical said, you got nothin to lose anyways. Btw i do n't think the sovereign silver did really work for them, but whatever...######Well if you can be very sociable i do n't think they 're goin to say ``you 're not eighteen '', but everyone thought I was shy or arrogant. It sucks that you have to adjust your personality to this problem. If there 's really no cure for this problem, I 'd rather die to be honest, but that 's sort of what I already am.######Is it significant when you can smell the bad breath through the nose? I mean there are some people with bad breath that ca n't be smelled through the nose, and others that can.######It 's not significant at all, I think. The bad breath we got is the unbearable one. I mean Morning Breath most of the people have, but it can only be smelled if talkin from real close, and it does n't make people want to hold their noses, in other words: it 's bearable, but ours can be smelled from 5 feet away plus it 's 24/7, it makes people want to hold their noses or at least touch it for a second. I noticed this, they touch the side of their nose, or rub it. Some people do n't want to hurt your feelings such as those who are really close to you. Even they have to rub their noses for a second. It must be absolutely unbearable. What are your plans crossmyheart?######BUSTED, Yeah thats the truth. \* sigh \* lol. After I found out people could smell my breath even with my mouth closed I freaked and one time almost passed out from trying to breath less lol not fun. I wish they would just say something rather than touch their nose or something because I know they are just trying to be polite or whatever but when it 's someone I know real well I would tell them that I ca n't help it and everything but only if they ask. Anyways... my plans? Well, heh... my first step is to tell my dad. He knows I have bad breath atleast when I told the ENT my dad was there with me... So my first step is to make my dad understand my situation so he can take me to doctors without feeling like I do n't have a problem. After that hopefully my dad will help me work this out. I ca n't/ wo n't go back to school next fall not if I 'm like this. I barely kept my grades up this year. As we all know it seriously effects everything in life. I 'm hoping God will help me/us with this situation. I do n't really know what I 'm going to do. I do n't think I have LPR or anything because I 'm too young. I do n't have allergies, but I have n't been checked for food allergies so hopefully I 'm going to get that checked out. Although I took some foods out of my diet like dairy etc but then I found out the gum I was chewing had dairy in it haha it was kinda ironic but it 's probably not enough to do anything. But yeah so I 'm stumbling over my plans as I have no idea what is causing this. I 've been checked for sinus problems etc, maybe I 'll get a CT scan, that is if my dad will let me, if he does n't help me with this I will just freakin go anorexic or something and have him take me to a doctor anyways that way I wo n't have to do anything and maybe get my dads attention, yeah thats pretty bad I know but I do n't care anymore this makes me so crazy, but you already know about that well I can see I 've written too much and I do n't even know if this made sense lol sorry.######Can you guys sometimes get a smell of your BB by somone's backfiring/breathing back the smell into your face? That is the most demoralizing thing I struggle with. Couple weeks ago I was having lunch with co-workers and another co worker came behind me. I guess she was breathing hard and a whift of stinch took a hold of me. I knew it was my breath that was lingering in the air. All she did was desrupted the air circulation and some of it blow back at me. The worse thing was I had my mouth completly closed, as it usually is during social interations. What a curse. I almost noticed that when speaking with a particular co worker, usually from a good distance, her breath can blow back my BB. How I know it 's not her with the BB? Well, I usually pay closed attention to others' reaction when they are speaking with her. They do n't step back, place hand on nose, or make any facial expression indicating disapproval as normally happends to me. It ca n't be her with the BB; it 's mine. I guess it one reliable way to test if my breath is dispeckable. It 's pretty reliable. She an elderly woman and she really likes me as her friend. We eat lunch together and I usually brings her lunch that I prepared for myself.######Try to go for what noptical did first: an xray of your sinuses. Maybe it will show the chronic muous thickening noptical had, so the doc will suspect a chronic sinusitis. Then go to the next step which is the ct-scan. Do n't go for the ct-scan immediately cause the ENT prob wo n't let you and if there s no infection shown on the ct scan then he will think there 's no sinusitis cause they think they are 100% reliable, but they 're not. Noptical, do you know if there are like different kinds of chronic sinusitis. I do n't get why ENT's keep sayin the mucous has to be yellow, green, while chuckwho said his mucous was clear: Also why is it that he only had bad breath and none of the other symptoms such as sinus headaches, toothpain.######I fell your pain I have had the same problem with PND for the past year, it 's been a complete nightmare. I was a very active 24y. o yet now I shy away from personal or social situations because of this horrible smell. I have saw quite a few ENT's and finally i think I may be on to something. I has a Ct scan done and it was found that I have turbinate hypertrophy (swollen turbinates which block the nose) and sinusitis also in my right maxillary sinus. The doctor said the smell was from the PND caused by the sinusitis and the hypertrophy. I had cautery done to reduce the swelling and allow me to breath and I am taking Astelin to help stop the PND. So far its been three weeks but I have yet to stop the smell. I should feel great since I can breath but I do not. People still step back when I speak and I still can not stand close to people because of my breath. My doctors keep saying give it time yet they do n't have to live with this it 's embarrassing and it truly bothers me. If anyone has any advice I 'd love to hear it. I am in need of desperate help!######BUSTED2, I read somewhere that there are 2 types of sinusitis, fungal and bacterial with the bacterial one being more common if I recall right. I also read that chronic sinusitis can be caused by allergies. Here 's a list of causes of sinusitis I got from a site (too many: /): Allergies- such as dust, ragweed, animal hair, and smoke. Hay fever Allergic rhinitis Rhinitis Asthma Common cold- sinusitis may start off as a cold Fungal infections Bacterial infection- sinusitis can be caused by a bacteria. Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) Vasomotor rhinitis Immune deficiency diseases HIV Cystic fibrosis Allergic disease Allergic fungal sinusitis Nasal polyps Nasal abnormality Deviated septum Enlarged adenoids Nasal foreign body Penetrating wound Infected tooth socket --------------------------- I 'm sure not all of them have the common symptoms we know (headache, green mucus, facial pain/numbness) so if we DO have sinusitis we probably have some less common type. Crystalgray, It 's been only a year since you had that problem so I think you should n't worry because you probably have some kind of infection that has n't developed as much as in the rest of us. Are you on some antibiotics for your sinusitis? If the sinusitis does n't go away on its own after the surgery, I think in this case you need sinus surgery or something to clean your sinuses manually and maybe enlarge the passages for proper drainge (sinus endoscopic surgery or something like that). If you let your sinuses clean themselves I think it will take some time. By the way after having your turbinates cauterized did you notice any loss in the sense of smell?######Yeah, I just do n't get it. I do n't have any symptoms except pnd and bad breath. I get a sinus headace maybe once a year but I do n't see how it can be a sinus infection. But I 'm going to do everything there is to solve this problem, leaving nothing to doubt.######I have a question. Is there any possibility we, or one of us has some sort of rhinitis or nonalergic rhinitis? When I went to the ENT he said thats what I had, he was basically saying I do n't know what you have, and he gave me nasonex which does nothing. lol. But I just looked it up online and it talks about sneezing and runny nose etc and I do n't have any of those symptoms, I 'm starting to think I have some sort of choronic sinus infection. lol ahhhh######After I had my 1st of 2 allergy tests on 6th June the doc gave me Nasonex too I do n't know if it 's helping me, probably no. I even think the PND is worse now. Anyway, I have to use it until my last test in 19th June.######Funny, my doc has been giving me nasonex too. It use to help me with my blocked nose before the Septum surgery. I have been only using it for a month after the surgery, but it did n't help stop the pnd. After u got tested for allergies, what will your ENT do next?######BUSTED2, I want to have tests for chronic sinusitis done and thats all.######So not everyone with thick/excess postnasal drip has bad breath right?######probably not, but uhmm, I think the best thing to do is wait for any updates from noptical. We seem to have somewhat the same symptoms. He has found a good ENT who 's willing to help him and listen to him. If he 's got this solved all we have to do is listen to his advice and convince our ENT's what the problem is, which is hard of course, I mean usually it goes the other way. They figure out what 's wrong with us and tell us that. Do n't go trust your ENT on what he says immediately. Apparently they do n't really have that much knowledge about what 's causing bad breath. I 've met some ENT who said postnasal drip ca n't cause bad breath and it is coming from the stomach. Luckily there 's the internet which I 've researched a lot on. (I 'm pretty sure you and noptical did too). Remember that when you go visit a new ENT, do n't forget to tell him how it 's taking over your life, how completely isolated you are, how it 's keeping you from having a normal life, causing you depression and problems with school, otherwise I do n't think they 're really willing to help you get rid of the problem, unless it 's someone who really seem to care about his patients, but I doubt it. I mean most of them have a ``I 'll prescribe you a nosespray, now get outta here '' attitude. The worst thing about all this is that it is n't our fault, I mean we all have a decent oral hygiene, but everyone keeps acting like it is your fault.######Yeah, okay.######I 've been on the Candida treatment for one week. I know it takes time but I do n't think it 's doing any good with my white coated tongue and BB. I will continue for another week or more and will continue with probiotic. Anyway. This is demoralizing.######So I 'm back from my allergist, had my 2nd and last test done (havent done the bloodtest yet though) and really f$% &$ \*\*\*\*\*\*. So, I have 24 different allergies for whatever you can imagine. From food allergies I have to tomatoes and shrimps (dont care about the latter but I used to eat a LOT and of tomatoes) Now from other allergies I also have to 3 types of flour, olives, some fungi and many many more. The doc also told me 5 of those that are most important for my nasal function. He also prescribed me some meds (just a temporary solution) and said that I will probably need to have allergy shots (1 shot/month, for 2 years) and because I have many allergies it will be very difficult to fight them Now if I ca n't treat those allergies I only wish it 's not the allergies that cause me pnd or whatever causes me bad breath. I 'm so damn \*\*\*\*\*\* and depressed at the same time Now I will visit my ENT soon.######noptical::. I 'm so sorry you 're dissapointed. If the food allergies are whats causing the pnd atleast you know and you can act on it. I bet the allergy shots and everything are going to help you. You are making me want to go in for allergy testing. Good luck with your ENT. What were the 5 allergies that he said had to do with nasal function?######crossmyheart < 3: Fungi: 1) Cladosporium herbarum Pollen: 2) Lolium perenne (Ryegrass) 3) Olea (olive?) 4) Parietaria jud- (Wall pellitory) 5) Phleum pratense (Timothy grass) Those are the 5 allergens MY body reacts worst to and are related to my nasal function. So it is different for everyone, you better have a complete allergy test (the blood test is just a part of it).######Okay thanks. Yeah I think I got tested for all of those and I was negative which I was mad because I still have no idea why I have pnd. So next I 'm going to get tested for a bunch of food allergies.######Woah that 's a lot of allergies u got, noptical. Maybe I should do one too. I understand why you are mad, cause this problem is really frustrating. I 'm really \*\*\*\*\*\* too. But still the thing to figure out is what 's causing the pnd to cause us to have bad breath. Could there still be some kind of sinusitis in there ?? To be honest I do n't really mind the pnd and the mucous in my throat as long as I do n't have bad breath. The bad breath is the real problem.######Busted::. Ah but think about it. There are so many people worse off then us. You should find someway to help them.######Crossmyheart, Yea if I could help them, I definately would, no doubt about that, but I ca n't even help myself. (sarcasm) But maybe you should give up finding a cure and start helpin others, if ya feel like you have the responsability (/ sarcasm)######Hi noptical, Could it be that the allergies you have, might have caused you the chronic sinusitis you think you have? Especially in the situation you use to be, with the deviated septum and stuff. The allergy test thing was a pretty good idea. It gets us a step closer to finding the right treatment.######lol I do n't know I 'm just saying if you ever think of taking your life because of this problem (which I totally understand) you should think about who could use your help despite of our problem.######busted2, I do n't really know (although it is possible that chronic sinusitis might be caused by allergies), I only hope it 's curable... You know I noticed that my bb is much worse when I 'm out and I feel the PND dripping into my throat when I go out, sometimes to the point that I ca n't breathe properly. Also I remember that my breath was n't all that bad when I returned home from school, even if it was horrendous during the few previous hours. It 's like some allergen is instantly triggering bb or something. I 'm just not sure if this is my illusion or not because you normally ca n't breath and feel your own bb no matter how you try. Maybe its just my nose playing with me and becoming super sensitive when I 'm out or something... Also, early today I took my first antiallergen (prescribed by my doc, called ``Xozal '') and I do n't know, maybe its just the placebo effect or something, but I think my PND is reduced since. Lets wait a few days and see... I suggest everyone to have a allergy test just to be sure...######@crossmyheart Good idea lol, that 's what I actually thought of too, but I do n't want to give up yet. @noptical I usually feel like I have bad breath all the time. There are no real times that I feel like it 's worst or better. Do you remember a moment in your life where you did n't have bad breath, such as in childhood? I ca n't, but as a child you just do n't think about it. I use to be very quiet boy though, but that changed when I got to highschool, I started talkin a lot and a lot of people were offering me gum. Pretty humiliating that was.######I know this was for noptical but thats exactly how I was and am. I used to be sorta shy when I was younger but I was growing out of that in 7th/8th grade when I found out I had chronic bad breath. It 's kinda funny cuz I 'll have gum in my mouth and people will still sometimes offer me gum. I just gave up taking gum from people... I just say no because I know its not going to help and if I have to LIVE with it they obviously can stand it for a little while geeze lol.######Hi, Guys; I just saw my doctor and compliant about my dry mouth and BB and wanting some medication in increase saliva flow. He said the my blood sugar is very high and that he has been monitoring it. Anyway to make a long story short, he thinks my dry mouth is indication I have diabetes. Great. He is doing a third test to check to make sure. Great. BB and now diabetes? This is a horrible nightmare. Oh well, life goes on. One a positive note. I ordered the Tung brush and have been really brushing the deep back of my tongue reall, really, really hard-up to 4minutes. At first there were bleeding b/c I have bumps at the back of my tongue where food traps, and crevisis for VSC to camp out. It 's working amazingly. I do n't have chronic BB 24/7. My mouth stays clean, tongue pink, and no horrible breath. I tested it out today when I met a friend for lunch. I usually can smell my own breath when she talks directely in my face; she is that sociable. Well, no BB coming from my mouth. Please, please, brush hard at the back of your tongue. I ca n't beleive all these years it 's that simple. What I am saying is brush the HECK out of of it; back of tongue. If all these years my BB has been caused excessive build up of VCS back of my tongue, and now Im using Tung Brush to rid the stich, awesome. Well let u knw prgress.######Well I can brush my tongue for several minutes really hard but the smell wo n't go away, nor will the coating.######Hi, Busted; I had the very same problem. I used my toothbrush to clean my tongue but it merely massaged the VSC/bacteria in the very back of my tongue-I guess it \*\*\*\*\*\* them off so they multiplied by the billions to torment me. Than I used scraper but no good either. I am theorizing that my tongue has deep cravisis, groves, nook and crannies that using toothbrush did nothing. if my tongue was a flat board than the scraper would scrapped off the germs. But it did n't. I purchased a Tung Brush. This device is brutal. At first, my tongue bleed b/c the bristles are hard. It really cleaned the back well. Formally using ordinary t/b did not scrubbed off thick mucuses and thick saliva like the Tung Brush did. You really got ta clean hard. I gagged, chocked, and hated the entire ordeal. This is insane. Why in the world can I just brush and have ordinary life w/o BB. Anyway, it has been 4 days using the Tung Brush and my mouth has never felt, I am not going to say fresh b/c I never had fresh breath in my life, clean like this. I keep thinking that in a few days the BB will return and back to my nightmare, but so far no one placed their hands over their nose or stepped way back talking to me. I am using Lovoris toothpaste and mouthwash; cheap stuff. Not like Katz and Speiser's. It 's working for me; so far, best result i ever had.######Busted; I am still on the Candida cleasing treatment, three pills of probiotic, plus GSE 3x a day, and colon cleanser. I am thinking it could be this treatment but I really do n't think so. It 's the Tung Brush that 's doing it. The Candida treatment does nothing more than filled my inside with herbal junk that claims ``cure '' just like Katz and others. Truely, I do n't know. I just know that the Tung brush is helping. Why all these years brushing and scrapping my tongue did n't do any good but it is today, its b/c the VSC are sooo deeply imbeded on my tongue that the colony just wo n't come off by mere soft bristle and tongue scraper. I have bumps on back of my tongue like warts. They prevent scraper from shaving off the VSC in my mouth. Again, try what I suggested. It 's really cheap. The last time I spent$ 150 on the Breezecare product from Austrilia, the K12 stuff that does n't work. I just hope I wo n't be disappionted in a few days/weeks b/c my BB illness returns.######Hey: The bumps on the very back of your tongue are actually taste buds, not warts. If you look you will also see smaller bumps on the sides of your tongue that are also taste buds.######Well I 'm happy for you that something actually works, but like noptical and crossmyheart, I 'd rather go for a permanent solution. I know the problem originates in the sinuses. flgrl is right, those are taste buds and it 's not very good for u if u keep brushing your tongue that hard till it bleeds.######oceanside glad that it worked for but unfortunately its not that simple for everyone. It seem that the root of your problem is different than ours (xerostomia maybe?) . In our case (at least mine and busted2's) the coating does n't go away not matter what you do. When I scrape the back of my tongue only the white stuff that is on the surface goes away but the white coating doesnt go away. busted2, does your tongue a little bit ``furry '', you know, a little bit ``hairy '', not smooth?######Hi, I understand the ``wart '' like bumps are teastbuds. Mine are irrugularly large. I am just excited that something is finally working for me, and I just wanted to share with my fellow BB sufferers. Like I said, I still have PND, congested sinueses, dry mouth, sneezing and all that junk. It 's been five days and my mouth has never felt this clean, pink, healthy looking tongue. This morning my morning breath acutually felt ok. I did n't have to run to the sink to spit and immediately brush than guzzle down profresh/CIOS. I still have tonsilstone lodged in my right tonsil, but I woke up with thick saliva in my mouth instead of the normal sewage. Yes, Noptical, I 've brushed and scrubbed my tongue in the past w ordinary toothbrush than scrapped but no relife. The only true test I need to do is ask a trusted friend to smell my breath; that 's the only true way I know. Honestly, I am scare/terrify to ask b/c if the answer is yes, BB still exists, I would be devasted, my nightmare continues, hopelessness, depression and depairity. However, I need to find out. An hour ago I stopped by to grabbed lunch and the waitress spoke inches away from me. Amazingly, she did not reacted or stepped back as normally experienced for me. My doctor referred me to an ENT. I will still visit him for my sinuses, but I wont manipulate my condition w hopes that my BB be cured. Again, the only difference I am doing in my oral regimen is using the Tung Brush and working the back of my tongue hard. It 's like going to the dentist having a clean. It 's painful but the feeling of freshness n cleanliness is great. I have n't had cavity in 20yrs, perfect oral hygyne, just receeding gumline from brushing 4-5x a day to rid my mouth of horrible sewage BB. Anyway, wish me luck. I will ask my friend to smell my breath. If the answer is no BB. Hallelujah. I will keep you posted.######Hey, Noptical; How are you buddy? The last time I spoke w u I started the Candida treatment. Well, I m still on it, with Pau D'arko tea, GSE drink, and a whole bunch of probiotics, and colon cleanse too. I seriously doubt the radical positive changes of my BB has anything to do with the regimen. I do n't know. Beleive me, I am not going off of it anytime soon. Onless some major allergic reaction takes place. I do n't want to junx my goodluck-no BB. I still have to ask my friend to smell by breath for confirmation. Anyway, I am sorry about your dissappiontment with your doctor. Keep us posted.######oceanside, do n't you think that a visit to a gastroenterologist, ENT, allergist will make your treatment faster Do n't take me wrong, but I believe all those home remedies are c \* ap because they rarely help you and if they do, it takes ages and it 's still not a treatment but a temporary relief Sure, diet helps, but along with the right medication and medical treatment it could be the perfect solution I would suggest a visit to an allergist for a full allergy test. I 'm on an antihistamine (xozal) for my allergies (3rd day today), and I 'm not sure if it is just my idea or not, but my bb is much better when I 'm at home now (actually I ca n't smell it AT ALL) and my pnd has been lessened. And probably better when I go out too (usually when I go out the pnd is horrific. and bb too...). Anyways, this is just a temporary solution, I will probably start an allergy shot treatment early July (lasts 2 years, 1 shot/month). Meanwhile I 'll visit my ENT to hear what he has to say about all this. Will keep you posted.######Nop, I will continue with my ENT for long-term treatment with my sinuses. I had allergy shots two-years long when I was a kid. I am allergic to dust mites and numerous other cridders. But overall, things are starting to look pretty good for me and my BB condition. From my last reports, it has been six days and my BB is doing great. Tomorrow I will ask my bestfriend to smell my breath to make sure that it 's certain that my BB has greatly deminished. Do n't give up your search. Talk agian, and thanks for your advice. I really appreciate it.######anything new with you guys? nothing new with me... \* sigh \* but hopefully there will be soon######crossmyheart: Nothing interesting, really. I just returned from my allergist. He checked the results of my allergy blood tests and told me that I 'm not affected by the allergens that much and that my post nasal drip (and mucosal thickening) is most likely caused by my allergic rhinitis. I will take the allergy shot (took first shot today) treatment until October and if I see any difference (he told me that it might not help much in my case because I do n't have too many antibodies for the allergens that affect me or something like that) I will follow the complete treatment (1 shot/month for 2 years). oceanside, where did you buy your tung brush? I want to buy one and see if it helps. What toothpaste are you using. Are you using anything else too? (special mouthrinse?)######What does your ENT think about it? Does chronic sinusitis still have something to do with it ??######I have n't gone to the ENT yet due to being really busy. I will keep you informed as soon as I go.######Hey noptical, how things been goin lately? Have you found some time to visit your ENT yet?######Hello, hopefully you guys arent giving up on our. Ive had the problem since i was 15 and I am now 22. I first tried all the toothpastes (Therabreath), all a wast of money. Then went to the dentist and that was a waste of time seeing how my teeth were really nice (thats whats the dentist said) and to gargle with saltwater for my tonsils and that never helped. I then went to a throat/nose/ear doctor and said I had no sinus infections and advised me my PND may be caused by allergies so I went to get an allergy test in march and it showed me having allergic reactions to everything except cats/dogs. Ive been getting shots (2/week) since April and approaching what they say is the highest strenght bottle (highest level of antigens they inject into you) in which you continue on that. I know that the BB and PND are connected because they both happened around the same time. I will let you know how the shots progress.######That 's awesome that you 've found out what 's probably causing your PND, even if it is allergies, and alot of them. I hope the shots work out well. I went through everything you did, including allergy testing. But no luck, I have no idea whats causing the PND and no doubt the PND and BB are connected. Good luck with the shots!######Giving up on my problem is sort of like givin up on my life. I 'm not doing anythin right now because of the fact I 'm too afraid to talk to people at school. Oh well... luckily we do n't live forever. Could you imagine the rest of you life living like this... Well maybe you can, but I know I will never be able to.######I have had post nasal drip so bad the last few weeks that I was throwing up yellow mucous. However, the stuff in my nose was white or clear still. I have been antibiotics for a few weeks to try and treat a sinus infection and I am still struggling with it. I pnd makes it hard to breathe (also causes reflux), my tougne is white, my head gets hot, my head is a bit dizzy & my ears are draining. I get bad breath but generally it was in the morning or when I had extra pnd and my doctor agreed that the stuff was pnd. When I would brush my teeth I was spit up white chunks that smelled like rotten \*\*\*\*\*. I thought I was rotting from the inside out but she said it was pnd. But that is n't the worst of my problem now it is all of the first things that I mentioned.######I have been to an ENT and an allergist. I have been suffering from PND for two years. I have been diagnosed with ``sinus disease ''. My PND causes me to cough and my cough often leads me to vomit. My last doctor said that antibiotics are often diagnosed for sinus infection and they only rid the symptoms but dont get to the actual cause. He said I would need antibiotics for at least 3 months. I only lasted 3 months on his regimen- antibiotics, prescription decongestant, nasal steroid and affrin. I also had to irrigate my sinus 3 times a day. I got pregnant and did not want to take all the meds... I am now trying an acupuncurist... I do strongly suggest you try irrigating your sinuses. It is very helpful.######Wow what a screen name ``permacough ''! Wow 2 years! Sinus disease... wow Oh how I hate vomitting! I did it for about 2 weeks because of PND and it is hard on you. Sinus infections seem to be very tricky! I did n't know you could take antibiotics for so long but since being on this forum it seems like everyone is on them for months! Holy cow! That ca n't be good can it? I am very worried about getting pregnant with all this going on.######Hey Crossmyhear, i saw your thread concearning nasonex. How has that been treating you? I just got some today from my doctor.######Well, I only used it for about two weeks. It helped greatly with congestion (when I was also doing a saline wash) but it did not do anything for my postnasal drip. On the other hand my pnd is different because there isnt alot of it and its thick. I do n't have allergies, so someone who does might see different results than me.######Hey Busted Ive started having the same problem nearly 6 months ago. its terrible i know what you are going through. It got me so depressed that now i see a psychologist. It started as a sinus infection, and it went away immediately once ai took antibiotics but then after a week or 2 it came back and it has since stayed. Now no antibiotics help. in the begining i could taste something really bad in my breath, every time i breathed through my mouth, but that taste has now gone, the the post nasal drip stil remains. So through my experience i think you have a chronic sinus infection. Ive been to 3 ENTS and an allergist and no one could really figure out what was wrong with me cos i dont have any thing wrong with my sinuses anatomically. I suggest you see a naturopath or something cos thats now my path..######-General###-Open to All Other Health Topics###-Moved:

It totally freaked me out at first because it was unlike anything I had felt before, got me thinking I had a brain tumour or something similarly terrifying. I was then diagnosed with having sinusitis, and my doctor prescribed me antibiotics for 5 days. These did nothing and the symptoms got worse and worse the more I worked myself up over it. I went to the hospital after a few weeks as I had a super freakout, and was told there was nothing I needed to be worried about. Went back to my doctor and he suggested it may be eye strain so I got some glasses which do n't really help. I got into such a state about it the other day again that I ended up at the hospital again, and the helpful doctor there advised he believes I am still suffering from a sinus infection. He suggested I take painkillers 4 times a day every day for a week or so to see if they help. Has anyone got any suggestions as to what might make this go away? It has been going on for almost 3 months now and is making me crazy! Any advice would be highly appreciated.######Many people are prone to continuous sinus infections. Just simple airborn allergies can start them off. You may want to check out some allergy medications with your doctor. Sounds like you might be just severly congested up there with perhaps a post nasal drip problem.######I have a sinus infection to, iv had it for at lest 2 years iv just finished 3months of antibiotics 2 different sprays and its done nothing, I feel like cap every day it takes all my energy! Its so hard to go to work every day and i work really hard since I was 15, All I can do is blow my noise and still feels like I have half a litre of mucus in my head! Allways got a head ache, got a CT scan the other day waiting for the results, im fu@#n freaking out! I think stress could play a big part and i have bad anxeity and get verry paranoid, every day I think im gon na die! so try relax. Also get any bad teath fixed or removed could be part of it i need 5 veneers and 4 pulled out, cant do that yet got no money, fu#@n bullsh@#! And im sure iv got it worse than just about everyone, and im only 20 years old. If that makes you feel any better.######thanks for the advice. is it possible to suffer from a sinus infection but have little or no congestion? i have the odd bit of congestion, but nothing major. i can breathe through my nose 95% percent of the time absolutely fine.######I was diagnosed with a sinus infection through an MRI that I took to check for something totally different. I had mild congestion but most of the time I could breath fine. I was always lightheaded and my vision was blurry for months. I believe these symptoms were from the sinus infection. I did n't have any nasal symptoms but the infection was there.############yeah i have all the symptoms of a sinus infection, just without any congestion (well a small amount, not very often at all). the bridge of my nose is always throbbing, as are my temples on and off. i did have a few days near the beginning of the infection where i was bunged up and blowing snot out, then again for about a week a month later. but nothing now.######I have exactly the same as you icandream674, but Ive suffered since last summer. I went to see gp so many times as its unbareable but as I also have no congestion so this is the reason she says she does not no what it is, because sinus problems usually come with congestion. So I have been refered to Ent specialist, I have had blood test and CT scan done, and am now waiting to go back to hospital for result at end of month. Sorry I cant give any advice except to say see a specialist, you have my sympathy as I know what your going through.######I have exactly the same as you icandream674, but Ive suffered since last summer.

Kept getting dizzy spells and sinus pressure, then the congestion came on. i too thought i had a brain tumor, or cancer or something. . so of course i got panic attacks too! Started taking zpack again, helped a little, went to doctor, she put me BACK on zpack. finished it a few days ago, was feeling better now i feel like crap again! 5 months of being sick! it really sux! now i 'm taking mucinex and robitussin and does n't really seem to be helping! I hope this helps at least ease your tension. i know at least 2 other people that are going through this exact thing!######i have been suffering from the same thing for over a year now had sinus surgery too. went to the doctor a million times and they couldnt do a thing. antibiotics didnt work either. constantly have sinus issues and brain fog that actually has caused me axiety. finally i went to an allergist for the heck of it and found out i am allergic to molds. my house has alot of mold it in so im moving and hoping it will stop this hell also im getiin allergy shots too. mayo clinic did a study and found out 94 percent of the people tested for sinusitis was being cause from mold.######I have been suffering sinus infections for over 12 months. sinus pressure, dizzy, fatigue and feeling really unwell. Had surgery, and a week after got bad infection that took 2 doctors and 2nd ent specialist 3 months to get rid of. Antibiotics and prednisone. 3 months later, it came back. Twice I got rid of it with same treatment, but took 25 days. But 3 weeks after, it came back again. It 's been 7 weeks and cant get rid of it. Am booked in for more surgery but ent doc is n't reasuring. Am going to get tested for allergies. Cant believe that sinus's can make you feel this bad. Often cant work. My sympathy to everyone who suffers this. Gridge######i went to my doctor 3 weeks ago and she prescribed me with a sinus infection, she gave me sum tablets but they havent done nothing for me at all. all i do is sleep becos its affecting my eyes its so annyoyin, am going 2 ireland on saturday so i dnt no wa am gna do gna be the worst holiday ever. can sum1 pls reply bk 2 me and let me no if thers anything i can do 2 relieve the pain abit whilst am away xxx######i have the same thing- very little mucus in my nose... i had a CT scan and the doctor said it was a sinus infection. . it just does n't come out my nose. Do n't know what to do! I 'm tired, it 's been months, i am often dizzy, have trouble concentrating at work sometimes... and have to give up all kinds of fun things because I 'm so tired all the time. I am getting depressed!######I had a sinus infection in april-may. it went away for... about a week or 2, then i felt dizzy, tired and out of it, VERY hard to explain what im going through... not the tired part but like, i see everything fine but im guessing the brain isnt functioning right so everyhthing is weird, not like drug weird but i dont know. I think i might have sinus infection again because i am swallowing LOADS and CHUNKS of mucus. I might need to see a doc again, the specialist. I have post nasal drip, ocasionally pain around my eyes, like cheekbones and above eyes, but nothing serious. Anyone going through this to? im running out of choices and probly and going crazy because of it!######I 'm going through the same thing, except I 've had it for 5-6 years. I 'm only just about to see an ENT now so there is some hope but again I do n't get much mucus, I feel congestion and I find it hard to breath but no obvious outward signs of infection, it looks more like a permanent allergic reaction. Its basically destroyed my life, so good luck######itssherritime: ``I had a sinus infection in april-may. it went away for... about a week or 2, then i felt dizzy, tired and out of it, VERY hard to explain what im going through... not the tired part but like, i see everything fine but im guessing the brain isnt functioning right so everyhthing is weird, not like drug weird but i dont know.

I have post nasal drip, ocasionally pain around my eyes, like cheekbones and above eyes, but nothing serious. Anyone going through this to? im running out of choices and probly and going crazy because of it! '' YES !! Much of hte exact same thing is going on with me. It 's like. . no outward signs of congestion... I can pretty much intake air through my nose... but I always have postnasal drip and I am always swallowing through my sinuses. I especially relate to the part of feeling ``out of it '' and foggy. I have felt like this for months now, and it is making me extremely crazy as well. I always feel like there is something wrong with me, even though I exercise and eat well and everything. And the worst part is that to my knowledge, western medicine really does n't know anything about this. I 'm really thinking of considering accupuncture and other types of chinese medicines to help me out because all of the doctors I have seen so far have been worthless to me.######I, too, have been dealing with this for about 3-4yrs. The feeling `out of it and foggy ' is EXACTLY what I would describe as a CONSTANT state of being! I have been a total outdoorsman/cross trained indv.all my life and now ca n't bring myself to even go ride a bike. No other health problems and do have some yellow mucous about 3x's a year. Tried the first line meds for SI's to no avail.This is also totally screwing with my life!######Even though Western medicine ca n't seemingly help, they are a better bet than acupuncturists and other alternative medicine practioners, simply because to become a doctor it requires many years of extensive training whilst acupuncturists and other such therapists do n't need very much at all, so doctors will have the knowledge down of how the body works even if they do n't seem helpful. Really pinpoint your symptoms, how is your sense of smell? Where exactly do you feel congested? If you can analyse your problems better you can pinpoint a diagnosis better, if you say you feel out of it then doctors WILL ignore you because fatigue and things like are so vague and attributable to so many other things that they would find it difficult to come to any conclusions. Do n't waste your money on alternative medicine, it wo n't help.######Sorry my vagueness and tone up there... I was very frustrated at the time. I have very much the exact same symptoms and experiences as the poster that posted above me. I have practically constant post-nasal drip, I 'll occassionally (usually when I have an allergy attack mostly, but sometimes just seemingly randomly) get dizzy and get a slight headache behind my eyes. I 'm always swallowing mucus. . and I can feel how much of it is accumulated in my throat. I try to use a neti pot but it seems like it 's not even getting all the way through my sinuses properly, even though the water passes through the other side. It just generally feels like the mucus that feels like it 's in my sinuses is generally wearing me down. I 'll feel heavy behind the eyes and I my eyes will get really light sensitive, all the time. I 've been to an allergist and found out that I do have a bunch of allergies (dust mites, cats, certain grass and trees). I 've also been to a university doctor thinking it was an infection and he gave me the zpack and that did n't seem to help much at all. I have n't had the chance to see a specialist just yet but I plan on doing so as soon as possible. As much as you may be correct on the training, I still have a certain faith in the ancient healing techniques of eastern medicine (neti pot is eastern i believe... from yoga?) . So I will try to find a combination of both eastern and medicine medicine. Plus I 've just been wanting to try accupuncture or maybe a chiropractor for a while anyhow. THanks for any help.Sorry for the rambling######Oh, I forgot a couple symptoms. I also generally feel short on breath often and I find I have trouble breathing WELL through my nose. It just generally seems like everything is not running smooth and so I 'm generally slightly out of it, always conscious of my bodily issues and aware of the feeling. It 's not the worst thing in the world, but I have been having trouble focusing in class, makes my breath smell, and makes me feel and act a little ``slow ''. I have an appointment with the ENT coming up soon so I 'll see what they have to say. Any remedies for this situation I have right here? Does it sound like a sinus infection or just perpetual constant allergies? edit: Also, I do n't know if matters or not, but I also have some body balance issues right now. I also generally feel out of balance. I have a broken pinky on my left hand and I have a generally weakness on the left side of my body. I was wondering if this was had some connection with my mental state. Or it could be psychological. But I 'm pretty stress free. So I have no idea. Thanks for the help######Very interesting. I 'm in a very similar situation, is your mucus is yellow? I get it all the time but never yellow, it is always there though, sometimes I gag a little or cough. You might be in luck if it is because that would mean a temporary infection, that and smelly breath, that could be an infection or nasal polyps. People actually adjust to how much oxygen they get, so after a while it seems normal but you still feel like it could be better. I find exactly the same thing with Neti pots, its odd. Do you get a ringing in your ears or semi-bad hearing? Do n't believe its in your head, my doctor did for a long time, the bargain I struck is that if its in my head it 'll be the last thing I look at, I 'll look at every single physical possibility and if none of that works I 'll have a go at looking at the mental aspect. I do n't believe it is at all, I really hate the label depressed or anxious because like you I do n't have anything that would actually cause it, you just end up chasing your tail if you pursue the psychological aspect and in fact making stuff up that actually was n't there in the first place. I like the way my post is now lit up with ads, that should be a give away as to how people try to sell you alternative medicines etc, pursue if you like but if you 're like me you 'll know what works and what does n't very quickly. Neti pots and steam inhalations are definitely in the right ball park, they make at least some sense from a physiological perspective but if you 're gon na dabble in alternative medicine try and read both sides before you go ahead otherwise you 'll just lose loads of money on what does n't work. I 've been to a few and they 'll often try to make you do it over and over again saying you need to keep doing in order for it to work... and it does n't. I wish you all the best because I 've not found anything to get rid of it yet, I 've not really met anyone yet who seems to have it as bad as me (I 've met people like you who have to some degree) but they do n't get a headache 24/7 and have massive trouble concentrating, breathing and just being ok. Oh and if you do n't believe any of this try drinking two pints of water in the space of an hour (or basically just try drinking a load of water) you 'll feel better all of a sudden and probably have somewhat more concentration and energy (it is noticeable but its no miracle cure), this is likely I believe because it thins the mucus and makes it easier to breath. But if that happens you 'll know that you have something similar to what I have. Good luck Whats a Zpack? I got this at uni when I started, did you? Its often a bad time when you get loads of illnesses. As I say you might be in luck, firstly because you 've caught it early, secondly because you have many physical symptoms such as bad breath, headache just behind the eyes, post nasal drip and a set of existing allergies which will give your ENT or doctor something to work with. As I mentioned if you steer clear of talking about the mental side effects- irritability, tiredness, feeling down etc or if you just mention them briefly because then they wo n't focus on the physical problem which is the cause.######I have been sick for 2 months, my doctor said I have a sinus infection and an ear infection, I feel so horrible at times... I just want to cry.######I 've had chronic sinusitis for years and eventually had an operation to trim the turbinates and reset my nose (which had been broken) and this worked for about three years. Then in March this year it all started again, pressure and intense pain above and below my eye, in my ear, down my throat, under my jaw, around the back of my head, with a bad headache. The last infection put me in bed for a week. I went back to work 2 weeks ago and today it started again- puffy red cheek on the affected side, and intense pain. I 've used my neti pot, steam inhalations, and nasal spray, and had to take a large dose of painkiller to keep it bearable. I think my only option may be to have another operation, but I really dont want to....######-Conditions and Diseases###-Sinusitis

I have nasal polyps and tested positive for mold and other environmental allergies and i have days when everything seems fine but I also have days that i feel like crap. Pressure and/or pain on the face (cheeks, nose and eyes), sometimes even tingling, maxillary sinus pain, upper teeth pain, ear fulness or sometimes pain etc and the doctors I saw said it 's sinus infection caused by allergies so take Allegra D or Zyrtec, use NAsonex, and everything should be ok. As I said, sometimes it is, but sometimes it 's not at all. I 've started seeing a naturopath doctor and I hope it 'll help a little bit, but I was wondering if any of you, the sinus pain sufferer, have any suggestion on what to do to improve my condition. I currently live in a city on the East Coast, with lots of humidity, but we 'll move shortly to Colorado, where the weather is dry and everybody says that this will help my sinus condition. Thanks.######Chronic sinusitis is usually a result of repeated antibiotics being used to treat sinuse congestion. If it is chronic you probably have a systemic candida infection and need to stop with the antibiotics and start with treating the systemic infection. I have had this for many years and finally think i have found the key to treating this thing created by my doctor way back in 1987.######I wo n't get into a detailed argument with the first responder to your post but would encourage you to be extremely wary of that non-scientific advice. The polyps may be the root cause of the infection not clearing. They can block the natural drainage passageways in your sinuses and cause infections to recur almost immediately. Has your doctor recommended anything to help shrink the polyps? Generally a short course of oral steroids followed by the use of a nasal steroid spray and Singulair are pretty effective at keeping polyps from recurring (unfortunately, there is no natural way to deal with polyps, they are difficult to treat and, if not addressed, can require surgery to remove them. Here 's a list: 1. Get a Neil Med Sinus Rinse bottle and irrigate your nasal passages 2-3 times a day. 2. Talk to your doctor about a steroid nasal spray to keep the inflammation at bay during allergy season. 3. Take an antihistamine daily during allergy season (and consider undergoing allergy testing). You really should look for an ENT or allergist who specializes in treating chronic sinusitis so you have someone who can help you manage this (if the ENT recommends surgery right away get a second opinion).######Scientific? I post nothing that is not verified medical fact.######When I lived in Colorado I had the worst sinus infection ever, caused by the dry air and dust. It was Colorado Springs in 1992. I do much better in a moist climate, but that 's just me. At least in Colorado there are good NDs to treat you.######I simply hope that people will take the time to actually verify those ``facts '' before they start thinking that antibiotics contribute to sinusitis. Bacterial sinus infections that are not properly treated with antibiotics can cause serious health problems.######I was given antibiotics and seldane only for my sinuse problems to return a short time later. I now have and have had chronic sinusitis for many years as a result of that witch doctor treatment and have now realized the source of the chronic sinusitis as well as the fact seldane was removed from the market as a dangerous drug. That 's what modern so called scientific medicine has done for me. I suspect you are in medicine and think you guys need to be ashamed of yourselves for what you do to people.######Your suspicions could n't be any more wrong. I have battled chronic sinusitis for 20 years but have had the good fortune to have been treated by 3 incredible doctors (2 ENTs and an allergist) who have helped me get my sinus issues under control. I wasted thousands of dollars on bogus natural treatments before I finally found a doctor who actually specialized in treating chronic sinusitis and I am incredible grateful to him (Dr. Donald Leopold at the University of Nebraska Medical Center) for helping treat and educate me about chronic sinusitis. I do n't want others who suffer from chronic sinusitis to spend the time and money chasing phony hope when there are real, scientifically proven, treatments out there. I certainly understand how people become frustrated because chronic sinusitis is a difficult disease to diagnose and treat, but blaming it on Seldane or antibiotics might just keep someone from getting the help they need to find lasting relief..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

He found a mole on my back the day of my surgery. He removed the mole and the lump. I just spoke to him today and he said the mole was skin cancer (melenoma) and it had cause the lympnode swelling. He setup a appt with a cancer doctor. I am just wondering what to expect? He wants the cancer doctor to look over my paperwork and give me his opinion. The appt is a month away and I did a search on google for melanoma but the more I look the more confused I am######Blue, Do you know the Breslow depth of your melanoma? And the Clark Level? Was melanoma also in the lymph node that was removed? If so, what kind of treatments are they suggesting for you? Websites often confuse some when you try to take in too much at once. I know I scared myself silly when I looked melanoma up after my diagnosis. Often times you see and read the worst case scenenarios which makes the ``anxiety '' worse. Let me know more about your pathology report and then I can tell you what I do know. Ok? God Bless! You 're in my prayers!######I spoke with my family Dr today, he is also a friend. He said that the skin cancer was one of the worst types 4 I think. I am sure the melanoma was in the lymphnode also. He suggested that I see the specialist and see what he suggest. I said what if I do nothing. He said its hard to tell I could have a few good months and then I would be gone, but he said its hard to define a few good `months' and it varies from people to people. Thanks.######Melanoma is serious stuff. I so sorry that this is happening to you. Your GP says ``a few good months '' if untreated, but it takes a month to see the specialist? Geesh! I 'd be on the phone looking for another specialist or filling a cancellation. Hope it works out well for you.######gblue, Tom made a really good point! You should call another specialist that would be able to see you sooner. You can even call the doctor you have the appointment with, and ask them if they could see you before (if there is a last minute cancellation) and/or ask them to give you the name of other specialist. Remember, it is your body and your life. If you do n't take pro-active steps to find out what you have and what your options are, no one else will. What you do n't know could hurt you. You are in my prayers....######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I went to a mole scanning clinic and they took pictures of it and said nothing to worry about. I do n't think i ' v seen any noticable changes but there could have been small changes and since its on my back its hard to see. 5 Years later, I decided to do a mole checkup, they said that it was suspicious and wanted to watch for it and any changes in 3 months. Anyway, there was a change in color. The mole is about 1-1 .5 cm in diameter. They did a ``shave biospy '' and injected me with a needle and i think they shaved it off. I think it might have been bleeding. The doctor said that she does n't think its a melanoma. She also said ``This is deep enough to remove the mole ''. Anyway 3 days later, she rang in and said after biopsy the mole was a melanoma but it was in its early stages and that i caught it early. I think she said that it was only in the epidemis in a small section. Anyway i went on the internet and find out ``Shave biopsy '' can not determine the stage of the mole as it ca n't give the full depth. Now i 'm thinking she is unqualified and i 'm worried this has spread more than her diagnosis. I guess what i am asking is, can they guarantee that it is ONLY at stage 0 through a shave biopsy? I 'm not asking about identifying which stage it actually is but whether it is stage 0 or something later.######Actually i do n't really know if it was a ``shave Biopsy '' but she did mention ``shaving it off '' And the area has been sore for about 5 days now and she gave a needle to make it numb before she did it. And she also put a bandage and cotton wool over the top of it.######To answer myself. I think she did ``Saucerization '' or a ``deep shave ''. After doing deep searching, i found this type of skin biopsy. My scar looks way too bloody to be a shave biopsy and has taken a week to heal.######I know it is three months later but I did not see this before. A shave biopsy is only a biopsy. Melanoma should be toally removed with a margin of skin to check out. How deep was it. Did you get the biopsy report? Well how are you doing now? How does that area look? I had a big problem with doctor who told me not to worry. Well, eighteen months later I had to have big surgery for area I asked them to check out. It was not okay at all... it was melanoma.######Originally it was a shave biopsy. It had a 1mm depth of skin. But the report said the melanoma was well clear of the margins. 2 Weeks later, They did a full depth excision. I went to a plastic surgeon to do it to be sure. They did a 1cm margin (Skin specimen was 4cm (width) by 2cm (height) by 1.5 cm (depth) but it was n't mohs. The second report (The full excision) said they found a scary wound in the middle of the cut out (From the shave biopsy) and no evidence of any malignancy. I 'm more worried because the first report said it was melanoma in situ but they found lymphocytic regression (This would have been in the top layer of the skin- epidermis as the shave biopsy does n't go far into the dermis). There exact words were ``Active lympohocytic regression in the area ''. Does n't tell me if its extensive or not. No lymph node tests were done. I heard that you can not diagnose a melanoma in situ if it has regression. But then i guess they found nothing in the second report which contained the dermal layer so in therory it should n't have previously made it to the dermal layer and regressed.######What was the Clark level? How dept was the melanoma? How come no one check your sential lymph node? I had a .75 mm on my head. I had a large area (2cm X 2cm) removed from my head and check out and my sential node checked out too. I was told this was the best thing to do. That was two year ago and all is till okay. My friend had it the same time I did. She had it does the shave biopsy way and that 's all. Two months later she had to get it redone. A years later she had it somewhere else. She is not doing good. Call one of the clinic like Mayo or Sloan Keating up and ask them about it. That 's what I did. Jack######Well i has a full excision 3 weeks after shave biopsy diagnosis and they did n't find anything other than the scar from the shave biopsy. They diagnose the clark level as 1. They did n't provide a breslow depth, it just says says small area, Clark level 1 and no dermal invasion with active lymphocytic regression and a very small amount of pagetoid spread. The GP said that the sentinel lymph node test was not necessary. She was saying the melanoma was so small that a breslow was n't even measured. Referring that it was 0.1 something but it did n't say this on the report whether she was right or anything. But i guess you go a sentinel check because it was on your head where there is less skin depth. Mine was on the lower back where there was alot of skin.######Also may i ask, did you friend orginally have a melanoma in situ? or was it larger? What clark level was your melanoma? I think i did n't get a breslow depth because the clark level is independently significant on clark level 1 melanomas.######She had melanoma in situ. No clark level was given to her. My clark level was 3. Breslow depth was .75 mm. My margin was clean and my lymph nodes were okay too. That was two years ago (9/11/07). I was getting a CT every three months for a year and now get one every years with blood work too. I now see a very good dermotagist (spelling bad). I see her every three month. She was busy with my skin problem at first but now she can not find anything on me at all. I keep out of the sun and use blocker every day. I also see a oncologist. Frist very three months now once a year. Are you seeing an oncologist? They know all about this cancer and can help you out. You must have the right doctor to make it thur this. I went to a bad one at first. I try to take him to court but my lawyer settle out of court but he is still in business. There are a lot of bad once out there. Melanoma is a real killer. You must make sure no cells got away. Good luck. Jack######What? How did she have melanoma in situ, but no clark level ?? clark level 1 is suppose to be melanoma in situ, so if they did n't diagnose the clark level how did they know it was melanoma in situ? I ' v been reading up on this, when you have clark level 1, a breslow is not required. However non insitu melanomas require a breslow. Wait, when they reexcised her 2 months after, was it another shave biopsy or a full depth excision? What margin did they use? Sounds to me that when they did the shave biopsy a bit was on the side, then it grew over 2 months then they only excised a situ margin which was not enough by the 2 months had passed. I asked for a 1cm margin with the plastic surgeon even though it was diagnosed as in situ melanoma because i ' v heard reports that 0.5 cm is not enough. Well i 'm gon na get myself a proper dermetalogist to overlook this. I have a GP who is doing this.######She went to the wrong dermatologist. He has a few PA work for him that do all the work. Biopsy which I saw was not a full report and that also is done in the doctor office. Just the wrong doctor. Sorry case but it happen everyday. I was stage 1A. I am seeing two sets of doctor, one not know about the other. Are you seeing a dermatologist and a oncologist too. You say you have a GP was it that? I hope it not a General Practice doctor. Jack######What do you mean the biopsy was not a full report? Did she get a positive deep margin on the shave biopsy or something? I had a shave biopsy but the melanoma was ``well clear of the margins '' as my report says, then they re-excised the melanoma with a 1cm deep wide excision three weeks later and found nothing. Yep, I go to a skin cancer clinic, but they are really just general practitioners specialized in skin cancer, so might be worth getting a dermatologist to double look over things just to be sure over the next few years. I went to a plastic surgeon specializing in melanomas to remove the melanoma and he overlooked the biopsy report and he assured me there was nothing to worry about. However reading over the report, i think its gon na be ok. Do you know from the margin how much they actually do cut out? Is that the margin of how much melanoma cells must be clear of or is it a margin around where the whole mole area was? My original mole was 8mm X 7mm (width & height) in total size, but the reexcision was 40mm X 20mm X 15mm (width & height & depth). When you subtract 7 from 20, you get 13, leaving 13mm of non mole skin from the top to bottom and a radius of 6.5 (if you share it equally)... Does n't that mean 6.5 mm margin ??? However my melanona cells was less than 0.1 mm wide so i guess 20mm makes 10mm each side ???? Is it a margin of the melanoma cells or the mole ????######When they did my operation there was no more cancer left the biopsy was all the cancer I had. I had a 40mm circle removed from my head. Before I had it done I checked out what Mayo and Sloan Keathing would do. They both told me to get it done this way and seeing a Dermatologest and an oncologist was also very important. These doctors just deal with skin problems and cancer. They are the ones you need. No one know the future but I feel being safe is better than sorry late.

This is not meant to scare anyone, it is meant to inform everyone about how serious this disease is... Here goes... In October 2003 my brother had a malignant melanoma mole removed from his chest. They did a wide area excision and check of his nearest lymph nodes to see if they had been affected. They had n't. He was sent home with a clean bill of health. He was to be checked by a dermatologist every three months from then on, which he did. He checked out fine each time. Now, fast forward to August 2006. He started getting a sore back and made an appointment to see the doctor on September 19. His pain was getting severe and we thought that he had a slipped disc or whatever. Unfortunatly, it was n't a back problem. A lymph node in his armpit was swollen and black. Had it biopsied and sure enough, it was melanoma back again. However, this time there were no moles or outward signs on his body... He was diagnosed with metastatic (which means it spread to other organs) melanoma on September 22, and he passed away from the disease on November 3, 2006. Exactly 45 days after he was diagnosed. Melanoma is a very serious disease and you can not always detect it on the skin. My brothers disease had spread to his brain, spine, liver, galbladder, subcutaneous fatty tissue and lungs. There were NO visible signs of his disease. This disease took his life in a matter of months. He was only 34 years old... !!! We have no idea when it came back, or where it came back, but, we do know that it was NOT on his skin. Metastatic melanoma is the most deadly, painful and untreatable of all cancers. I am light skinned and freckled and run a high risk of getting this disease myself. The thing that worries me is that it is not always on the skin which is a common myth. Unfortunatly, there is no other way to detect it short of a cat scan every couple of months (which is impossible financially). If any of you have melanoma, please be sure to get your checks, and beware of swollen lymph nodes. I am not trying to scare anyone, but, I was my brothers best friend and acted as his caregiver for the last 6 weeks of his life and I learned way more about this disease than I ever cared to know... Take care... In memory-Louis August 17, 1972-November 3, 2006...######I am so sorry to hear of the passing of your brother. Your information will help people take better care of themselves. I for one, will continue to be adamant with the doctors and getting my check ups. Please do the same with yourself. Your brother was very lucky to have you there for him, his guardian angel. I want to thank you for posting for the rest of us. It may be the life you save today because of your post. Janie######Thank you for sharing your story. I 'm so sorry for your loss. May God bless Louis, your family, and all those who have suffered because of malignant melanoma. Sincerely, L.L.######I am so sorry to hear that! I had melanoma also. They scanned my lymph nodes & removed three, but they were clean. Where else are your lymph nodes? I know under your armpits, but where else?######Lymph nodes arae in the neck, groin area too. What Clarks Level were you?######thanks everyone... I am still getting used to not having him around,... It has only been 2 weeks !!! But, they checked my brothers lymph nodes in the armpit because his melanoma was on his chest and those were the closest ones. However, I think they are throughout the body especially in the neck and groin area as westllen said... I have no idea what you are talking about concerning the Clarks level though. Must have something to do with how deep the mole was ???? We never did hear anything about the Clarks level... Basically, we were past that point, and into Stage IV of the cancer, so Clarks level was n't even an issue... swollen (and discolored) lymph nodes were one of my brothers first signs... Incidently, once the cancer passes to the lymph nodes, it basically passes to the rest of the body (organs) through those... Good luck to you with your melanoma... Keep getting your checks and at the first sign of ANYTHING out of the ordinary, please get checked out... I wish you well, and I am sure you will be fine... Just try hard to keep on top of it... Good luck to everyone, and thanks for the well wishes...######I agree that once you have been told you have melanoma, you must be extra vigilant with regards to your body. I would also had, that you should try to get into some clinical trials if at all possible. My brother passed away of melonoma at the age of 34 yrs also.... I miss him dearly.######I am sorry to hear about your loss too Danialla... I read somewhere that Melanoma kills mostly men between the ages of 25 and 50. And that the most deaths occur in men who are 34 years old... Is n't that just crazy... ??? It 's far to young to die that 's for sure... Again, I am sorry for your loss and I agree about getting checks and maybe doing clinical trials. I have also heard recently that they have a melanoma vaccine in the works and it works on dogs... (Yes, pets get melanoma too...) Anyways, it has n't been tested on humans yet and could be a number of years before it is available for humans (if ever), but, it sure seems promising... My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who is suffering from cancer and thier loved ones... Good luck to all...######My father has been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in July 06. He was doing fine until the end of Sept but then started spine problem. Now he is completely in bed and also has it in brain and lungs as well. My prayers are with you. We are in the same boat.######My heart breaks for you. What where your father's symptoms? Your family is in my prayers.######I am so sorry to hear about your brother, those Dr's should be shot! My husband had it yrs ago level 1V. His lymph nodes were fine but to be safe the Dr took them out on the same side his cancer was. That was 18yrs ago & he 's fine. Makes me so mad they should have known better. He is in my prayers.######I am very sympathetic to you and feel for your loss. No one should have to die from melanoma. You did not post your brothers mole depth, the staging, or clark level. I had a stage 1A melanoma removed in 2003 (.04 mm and clarks 2). I would gladly have had a sentinal node biopsy, but my doctors would not do it. My wife is a breast cancer survivor (12 years). She has no lymph nodes on her left arm because they removed them all. She gets lymphodemia that gets worse with age. Her left arm swells and hurts her some. She has had two severe infections in that arm from simple cuts. So doctors have to weigh risks with treatments. I have had some scares but am still fine. I would not shoot the doctors. Over 95 &#37; of Stage 1A are fine with just wide excission. Do n't 2nd guess decissions that are already made.######I am very sorry to hear about your brother. One thing that is definite about melanoma, is that it is NOT predictable. Not knowing what stage your brother was makes it more difficult to know how badly the doctor did n't do what he should have. If at his WLE he was a stage I- he probably would have been told by the majority of doctors to just watch himself and live his life. If he was stage II or III or IV, he probably would have been given more options. It is impossible to know what the next move melanoma will take. I am stage IIB. I had a breslow of 5.0 mm and was a clarks level of V. Thankfully I was still staged at IIB because it is n't showing in any nodes. There are people with much smaller breslow and they are stage III or IV because it has traveled. Like I said- I am sorry about your brother- any melanoma death is tragic. But if you watch yourself and get regular checks, you have a better chance of catching anything early and that is the key to survival. Health and Happiness to you.######Hello everyone. I am going to sound really stupid with this reply, but the truth is, that when my brother had his wide area excision in 2003, I have no idea what his breslow or clarks was. At the time, although my hubby and I were his best friends, he was married. So, I was n't near as involved with his medical care, or things of that nature. He divorced since that happened, and that is how I wound up caring for him... All I really knew at that time (2003) was that he was a stage I and after the excision, they checked the nodes, and they were clear so they gave him a clean bill of health... That 's about all I really knew. I never found his medical records from that time in his house after his death, so I assume maybe his ex-wife has them? I will ask her... If not, maybe I could get a copy from the Dr's? When he was diagnosed in 2006 with metastatic melanoma, they never mentioned anything about clarks, or breslow levels. Pretty much because it did n't matter. He was full of cancer, and it was just stage IV metastic disease. I will try to find out those other details though. I am really interested to know all of the details now... I am going to the derm for the first time on the 21st of this month. Wish me luck...######Once the melanoma metastisized, clarks and breslow would not exist... only when diagnosed is when it is usually important. Also stage I with no node involvement is normally a great prognosis. I hope your appointment goes well. Just a suggestion, write down any questions that you want to ask so that when you are in there you do n't forget them. I always forget to ask something I wanted to ask. lol######I am so sorry to read about your brother. I myself had a melanoma removed from my right breast in nov.. I never thought at 24 I would have to deal with this. I completely understand how you feel with the fact that he had no skin signs. My freckle was just that a freckle or mole, whatever you want to call it. I had no irregular border, odd shape, or raised at all. My doctor had it checked out just to make sure, but she was n't concerned at all, then the report came back 2 weeks later that it was early stage melanoma. By the time she called me, surgery was already scheduled, which was very frightening. It was very hard to hear because you look at pictures and just say that it is n't possible, because that is n't how mine looks. Then with your brother, who had no signs, I cann ' t even imagine. I myself am trying to tell everyone to get checked, just to be safe. What I have discovered is yes it is very treatable, but bye the time the ``signs '' are apparent, it might be to late. I go every 3 months to a derm. as well, terrified if they will find something new or not. I hope that you and your family are doing as well as you can be in a difficult time like this. I see that you have many other post on here, do you have melanoma? (REMOVED) Thank-you.######Hi Snowchickkim... I do n't have melanoma as far as I know. I go in for my first appointment on Feb 21. My brother is the only person I have known with Melanoma, and I am not all that well informed on the topic... Thanks for the reply Ladypepper, you gave me lots of info (like why they never mentioned Clarks or breslow levels...) I go to the derm next weds, and I am a little nervous to say the least. I am 30 (a year younger than my brother was at his first diagnosis), and I am covered in freckles and moles... I have light skin, green eyes and burn easily. All of that coupled with the fact of my bro dying from this has me a little worried... Just wish me luck... thanks... god bless...######You are very welcome and being worried is totally understandable! I hope everything goes fine at your appointment. Keep us posted.######Hi Guys... Went to the derm today... Got 4 spots taken off just to be on the safe side... Love my derm, she does n't screw around... However, I just about fell over when I got the bill... Over$ 1,000.00 for todays visit... I ca n't afford cancer-I have no insurance... Anyways, I will get the results back on Friday or Monday... I am sure all will be fine... I will let you all know... tata...######Hi Everyone... Well, I got the results back of the biopsies I had the other day and they all came back clear... All benign, and nothing to worry about at this point !!! YIPPEE !!!! Anywho-just wanted to let you all know... Needless to say, I am over joyed... Now, I just need to get that big bill paid. . !!!! Have a great weekend everyone !!!######Great news! Congrats! Keep watching your skin and keep up on your check ups. That is very good news.######I am so sorry for your tragedy. This story is so much how my Dad found his cancer was back. He had two melanomas removed from his back and had no signs of it coming back for almost 7 years. Then he started getting some pains, mostly in his back and abdomen. We thought possibly kidney stones, but he felt it was worse and went to see his cancer doctor. His cancer doctor actually tried to blow him off and told him he was fine, because he had no outward signs of having cancer, but at my Dad's insistence, the idiot doctor FINALLY agreed to a PET scan. The PET scan showed my Dad had metastatic melanoma with sites in his liver, lungs, spleen, bones... pretty much everywhere. He has been through a few rounds of biochemotherapy, and is now doing a different chemo, while awaiting a clinical trial, while the insurance sits on their arses and twiddles their thumbs hoping my Dad will die before they have to pay for anything. Stupid good for nothing, scumsucking, lower than dirt.... oh sorry. ANYWAY, if you 've had skin cancer before, it 's likely you 'll get it again. If you think something might be wrong, DO N'T LET YOUR DOCTORS BLOW IT OFF !!!!! Be pushy, insist they run the tests, and if they wo n't, then find a doctor who will !!! If my Dad had listened to his doctor, he 'd be dead now.######Sorry to hear about your dad... My brother died 45 days after he was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, so it would seem that your father is in a little better shape. . (thank goodness). . What you 've said is true on many levels... Of course the insurance company is hoping that your dad will die before they have to pay-they are bottom-feeding, scumsuckers... Secondly, if you have had skin cancer, I am also a true believer in the fact that it will come back... Unfortunatley, it seems that melanoma in particular does n't always come back on the skin-that just happens to be the ``primary '' site... My brother did n't have any cancer on his skin when he passed... By then it was all in his organs, brain and bone... Who knows how long it had been growing... kudos to your dad for not letting the Dr. push him around... Everyone just needs to be extra vigilant when it comes to skin cancer... It really is way more serious than I ever really imagined until it struck my best friend... Good luck with your dad and hopefully the clinical trial will help and will be worth it in the end... Your dad is a saint to even sign up for a clinical trial... His participation may save someones life someday... Good luck to you all-you are in my thoughts and prayers... Please keep us posted as to his progress... bp######I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in feb07 then in march 07 the radiation doctor spotted two moles on my back and he wanted them checked before any procedure is done. So in mar 07 they discovered i had melanoma that has spread but they do n't know where it spread to and they are going to do surgery on apr 9 07. Can this be the same cancer that spread to the prostate?######I dunno about that Lakebulter (sp)... I actually do n't know much about cancer in general. But, when a cancer spreads it is called a metasticized Cancer. For example my brother had metastatic melanoma meaning that his ``primary site '' of the cancer that spread was melanoma. You can have metastatic breast, colon, prostate whatever, cancer. (I think)... Now, the spots on your back are melanoma and the prostate cancer would appear to be seperate. If they think that the cancer has spread they will probably give you a CT scan and PET scan or one or the other. Who knows, maybe there 's no cancer in the prostate but maybe other locations, which would seem to make them completely seperate. I would imagine that if you got the cancer in the prostate from melanoma you would have already known you had melanoma...? Am I making any sense ??? hahahaaaa... Anyways, you may never really know for sure... Obviously, cancer is a big mystery even to the medical and scientific community. At any rate-good luck to you... You will remain in my thoughts and prayers as you battle through this. Hang in there-be vigilant about asking your Dr.'s these kinds of questions. God Bless.######I already had two ct scan and they had missed the melonama cancer on my back.######Hi Lakebulter... Sorry to hear that they missed the cancer on your back... I suppose if that is the case- then the prostate cancer could 've actually been metasticized melanoma. ?? ... I find it odd that they would have missed it with a CT scan... Maybe it was very small ??? I wish I had answers for you... Just keep vigilant about your dr.'s... If you read on these posts, there are many folks who were not happy with the care they or a loved one recieved from thier dr.s... I for one was very unhappy about how the oncologists treated my brother... They were ready to make him into a guniea pig... And, they would never actually give us a straight answer to our questions... We got excellent care and support from the Dr. who actually diagnosed my brother and he was just a GP working at our local clinic (for folks with no insurance, they give lower rates for self pay patients, etc....) He is the most honest, informative, and caring Dr. I have ever met... He would call me every 3 days to see how my brother was doing. He gave me his home, office and cell phone numbers in case we needed meds or to talk or anything... He is now my primary physician... I wo n't even consider seeing anyone else... I wish that all the dr.s could 've been like him-but, the other dr.s needed us to tell them who we were everytime, ask the same questions over and over like they never saw us before (which they had)... Anywho-not to get on my soapbox about that (sorry)... The point is, keep pestering your dr.'s about all of your questions... You may even consider getting a second opinion or changing dr.'s all together... What you are going through is no joke and you really need someone who can help you through it... I am very sorry that you even have to deal with this and I wish you luck with everything. Please let us know how things progress... You will remain in my thoughts and prayers....######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

This stage is the earliest and most curable, and recurrence and subsequent death, after the local treatment, from melanomas 0.5 mm is a very rare event. The depth of melanoma lesion, also accurately predicted the risk for lymph node metastasis, with deeper tumors being more likely to involve the nodes. Melanoma depth is most accurate when measured by evaluating the entire tumor via an excisional biopsy, instead punched biopsy, which gives less accurate results.######0.5 mm is not in situ. Melanoma which has ANY Breslow thikcness (even 0.1) is already invasive and have stage 1.######I have had melanoma as well, Stage 1A .33 mm. The poster above told you that all .5 mm melanomas are ``in situ '' (Stage 0) that is not correct. Many early Stage 1 tumors that have progressed beyond the epidermis, even slightly, are well below 0.5 mm (my .33 mm for example). Nevertheless, the 10 year survival rate for most studies for a radial growth phase melanoma of less than .75 mm with no regression, ulceration or other negative factors (i.e., high mitotic rate) is very high (depending on the study you look at 95-99%). So you 're clearly in the 95-99% range of not having your cancer recur. Keep in mind those statistics include elderly and immuno-compromised patients so you really do n't have much to worry about and I 'm sure you 'll be fine with such a shallow melanoma. The .5 mm however DOES NOT mean that it is an ``in situ '' lesion. Hope that helps######Clark Level The Clark level refers to how deep the tumor has penetrated into the layers of the skin. This system was originally developed by W. H. Clark, MD back in 1966. Clark levels are officially defined as follows: Level I: confined to the epidermis (top-most layer of skin); called ``in situ '' melanoma; 100% cure rate at this stage You have ``in situ '' or Stage 0. You are lucky you got it early. You will be okay. MandMs know what she is talking about. Be good use sun blocker and do n't get too much sun. Jack############I was diagnosed with Malignant melanoma superficial spreading type, clarks level II, with focal apparent regression 0,55 mm in depth. T1NXMX. they did a re- execision and said they interpreted as residual of malignant melanoma in Situ with Dermal Fibrosis and the margins are free. I am so stressed! I do not want to go out and get exposed to the sun, wha are my changes...######Help, i am a nervous wreck. In 2005 I was found to have Melanoma in-situ on my neck. The dermatologist removed the mole and told me it showed a zero margin but to schedule an appt to come back to cut a little more around the area to make sure all was good. Well... things got hectic and I got pregnant (3X) AND NEVER RETURNED.I went in today to have a full body check, no new moles, and they now want to do the re-incision and test it. I am so scared I have put my life in jeopardy but not following up on this sooner! Even though I showed a zero margin, could cells still be left in and now I have stage 2 +?######Hi and congratulations on the babies... On your question, yes, they can... This is why you were told to do this... Have them remove the outer areas around the original site... Then get checked up every year with a Dermatologist... These can appear anywhere on your body and not just at the original site. . I am not saying that you will get anymore of these, but that in years to come to always be aware of a suspicious mole that may occur in your life... Please do n't worry, just enjoy life... Take care... Caroline######I 'm super nervous-- had a mole biopsied and went in for my results today. Melanoma .33 mm. Dermatologist excised the area around the mole and scheduled me for closure on Thursday and to see the Oncologist on Friday (my birthday mind you). He made it sound very serious and scared ``the sheet '' out of me. After reading these posts I feel a little better. What should I expect at my Oncologist visit?######Sounds like you got it early. Why are you seeing an Oncologist? You have to ask questions. What Stage and what Clark level is this? Was there any more cancer around the mole? Jack######Dermatologist said he got all the tumor which he said was Clark Level II as it penetrated the dermis, but had a low mitotic rate. As a precaution he referred me to the Oncologist who said he would say I am at Stage 1. He scheduled a PET scan for this Thursday and a blood test to rule out any node or blood stream penetration. Information is so confusing... does survival rate mean the cancer comes back or the people die ?? This young mom is still scared..######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

I am very pale skinned (with blonde eyes and pale blue eyes) I never tan-I burn very easilly even with high factor suncream on. Because of this I always avoid the sun, and am definately not a sun-worshipper (nor ever have been). I have lots of moles all over my body that range in color from whitey pink/skin colored, to red, to dark brown) but one particular one that I would call `unusual ' however I do n't know if it would be possible to have anything wrong with it due to my lack of sun exposure to the area-it is on the underside of my arm. I 've had it all my life but it has never been as large (I put this down to general growth-I 'm now in my early twenties) however it is currently larger than a centimetre across and has a jagged edge all the way round and is n't even round/symetrical anymore (it used to be). At one end of the mole there is a section that has grown into almost a triangular point across my skin (this has developed within the last year). The entire mole is raised above the surface of my skin to about 2mm at the highest down to a smaller height at other points. Colour wise it is mostly a pale brown color but has parts that are darker brown (almost black) and parts that are a paler livery color. In the surrounding area there are a couple of clear/skin shaded spots/scales I do n't know if this is relevent but thought should mention it. It sometimes is itchy, but overall I have little sensation in it at all, it is for the best part `numb '. It 's quite hard to the touch and could be seen to be crusty, the overall surface is bumpy. I think thats about it. Thank you for your time, sorry for bothering you.######Hi.... and believe me no bother...... My advice is rather short and to the point, but here goes....... GET TO THE DOCTORS.... Quick... PLEASE I do not want to upset you. It is just that I lost a brother to melanoma 10 yrs ago and I know that early diagnosis and treatment is imperative! A doctor (perferably a dermatologist) will be able to look at the area, can remove and biopsy the mole and help determine what needs to be done next. When you make the appointment please let them know that your mole has changed quite a bit. And please make time for the earliest appointment they have available...... it is very important. Again, I do n't mean to upset or worrry you.... remember only a doctor can make the diagnosis. But I do miss my brother ALOT... and have become somewhat of a ``crazy person '' when it comes to moles. . I have been known to tell people they should have their mole looked at if the looks of their mole concerned me. But I can also say that 2 of those people, one a 13 yr old girl did have melanoma and are doing great (She 's a doctor herself now). Please let us know what the Dr. says.... . and take care!######Thank you ever so much, you 've just told me exactly what I needed to hear by encouraging me to go, I 've had this gut instinct about the horrid thing for a while but you 've just confirmed that I should go. I will get try to get the first appointment I can-I woke up this morning and it was itching again. I 'm so sorry to hear about your brother but I 'm so pleased you have been able to help others-thats great about the 13 year old. Thank you, and I 'll let you know what the doctor says.######It looks like it 's going to be at least a week before the gp will see me, theres something at the back of my mind that tells me the mole is harmless-that being the fact that how could the sun damage my underarm? Would it actually be possible to have melanoma in an area that does n't see the sun? Thank you again.######Unfortunately it is possible to get melanoma where you do not get sun. I hope your GP will refer you to a dermatologist and if he does n't offer to...... than PLEASE ask to be... A well qualified doctor is imperative in dealing with any skin lesions. Good luck and let us know what you find out!######Thank you again, I do n't think there is enough readilly availiable info on the subject availiable. I 'm really annoyed that my doctor wo n't see me and am considering trying to get in to see another, I would rather know sooner than later. Again thanks.######Be vigilant. Do n't take no for an answer! Get in there ASAP.######I still havent got to the doctors-taking forever due to lack of support from family, but I 'm really scared now I knocked the mole last night and it begin to bleed and bleed... I 'm sure the bits I said the other day were triangular have grown too-the mole seems to be growing across the skin. My family just do n't seem to be able to see it though, they say everybody has strange moles and it 's perfectly normal, it 's driving me mad all they keep telling me is `but you do n't go out in the sun '. I just wondered would melanoma grow in this way? I need to prove to my family it 's worth getting it checked. Because it is n't colored black they think I 'm wasting doctor's time! thanks######You family needs to help you see a doctor. Even if it turns out that it 's nothing, you need some relief from the worry that this mole is causing you. Your family is not expert in the field of dermatology. Even dermotologist can be surprised by a mole that turned out to be melanoma, when it did n't look like it was. So if trained professionals ca n't say with 100% certainty, how can your family? Sure there are the ABCs to use to determine if a mole is suspicious. But that 's just a guideline. It 's not a perfect system, and some moles do n't have any of those characteristics. It 's there to tell the casual observer, that if your mole changes in any of the ABC guidelines, have it looked at. If it changes in other ways, like sensation (itchy, tingling etc) bleeding, crusting, oozing- also have it looked at. The odds are in your favor that you do n't have melanoma. But you will never know for sure or get the relief from worry until you have it looked at. I do n't know where you live, but go to the American Cancer Society's website. There 's a section called ``Public Resources ''. In that area should be a link to find free skin screening clinics that might be in your area. If you live in or near a larger city, you 'll probably have better luck. If you have trouble finding it, call the 800 on their webpage and someone can help you as well. These are conducted by dermotologists that volunteer their time. Maybe you can find a free screening clinic and you can just go. That way your family does n't have to pay or give you the money to do this. But I honestly think you need to be seen. If for no other reason than to give you peace of mind. Take care. I hope all goes well for you!######Melanoma is sneaky and some women actually get it in their vaginal area. Men in their genitals. Melanoma is n't just from the sun. If you have a mole that is different colors and is Odd feeling like you are talking and itchy. You need to get to a Dermatologist. I had a place on the back of my arm above my elbow that I knew was Odd but just did n't worry that much. Even had a GP look at it and he said No worries! Well That GP ``s no worries would of sent me to the grave if I had had faith in him. My odd spot was a Clark Level IV melanoma. Putting me at a Stage 1b on the staging of Breslow. You do NoT fool around with anything that changes in color or feeling when it comes to mole. It 's possible that it 's an atypical nevus that just needs to be ``punched ''... and another thing. Do not let them shave this for a biopsy. Tell them you want a punch excision for the biopsy. That will tell you and the dr and the dermatapathologists what stage it is and exactly the depth for any kind of or type of skin cancer. If it 's melanoma and it 's been shaved... often times the depth is not completely excisised with the shave leaving behind a residual melanoma and not accurately leaving a clear margin for diagnosis for what type of procedure needs to be done next. Ok. . sorry I have rambled on. I work for my derm and he is really a good derm but I will never have a shave again. I will always have punches for any type of mole or odd things! I wish youluck! And I hope it turns out to be nothing! Let us know!######Are there other symptoms that accompany melanoma?######Get to a doctor ASAP! Show them stuff on the net about melanoma. Put a guilt trip on them. Do whatever it takes to get there but get to a doctor! Even if you have to pull a nutty. . seriously. Melanoma is very sneaky and its not something to play around with. I wished your family would understand.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I am only 24 which he says is young and I have a history of ovarian cancer. I kind of understand this whole thing but it is still setting in. I had a small, pink, perfectly round mole removed from my wrist area on March 21. It burned for 3 hours, I looked up ``BuRNING MOLE '' on the www and it said to get it checked. 2 weeks later it was off. The doc says that it was 1.1 mm deep, meaning Clarks Level IV, but it could be farther down since that is all they took. He also said it was non-ulcerative which is good news. Now I must get another surgery to remove more skin from the area, a skin graft, PET scan, and sentinel node biopsy. Anyone that can offer me any more information or their experience with this kind of cancer is much appreciated.######First of all, the more important stat is the 1.1 mm depth, also known as the Breslow depth. The Clark's level is not as indicative of your prognosis. 1.1 mm is still relatively thin, and non-ulcerated is good. This is assuming the biopsy got all of the melanoma. You should have a Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) done before the Wide Local Excision (WLE). The WLE basically takes a margin of skin around the mole to make sure they get any stray cancer cells. The SNB is a diagnostic tool, to measure if any lymph nodes have traces of melanoma cells in them. If so, then there are other measures they will discuss. I highly recommend you get treated at a hospital with experience in melanoma. What area do you live in? The National Cancer Institute's website (a. gov site) has lots of good info on melanoma and treatment, I suggest you start there. Good luck!######Your breslow depth is in the guidelines to have a SNB to check your sentinal lymph node. You will have a WLE to remove the lesion completely. There is a lot of info on the net. The clarks level is not a highly valued measurement anymore... and a lot of people confuse the clarks level with the ``STAGE ''. This is not your stage. The Breslow depth is more important because it shows how invasive your lesion is. My melanoma was 5.0 mm (Breslow), clarks level V, and that puts me at a stage IIB. Your doctor will be able to stage you. Wishing you the best! Keep us posted.######Ladypepper, you are an inspiration to all of us! Did n't mean to hijack the thread, just wanted to let you know######Wow that was very sweet! Thank you for that.######Well it 's true If you can make it thru all you 've had to deal with than so can I !!######I have a couple of questions.... I 'm a 42 y.o. female who has tanned my entire life, many sunburns as a child on Lake Michigan. In 1995 I had a mole removed from my abdomen and was told it was a Clark's Level 2. Over the next couple of years I had 2 more moles removed and diagnosed with Dysplastic Nevus Syndrom (I 've read that it means that you have a lot of moles and are at higher risk for skin cancer.) Over the years I have continued to tan regularly and have a tanning bed in my home, although I do use self-tanners regularly as well. I check my skin and go to the derm, but I 'm curious if the malignancy could have spread at all. Would it be beneficial to have the SLN test done? What is involved in that and am I just worrying for nothing? \*\* Please no lectures on tanning. I am aware of the risks involved and used to own a tanning salon. Thank you for any feedback!######I am assuming when you say SLN you mean the node biopsy? The time to do that would have been when you had your excision. What was your breslow depth if you remember? It sounds like you would have been a stage I and if your breslow depth was under 1.0 mm they probably would not have done a SNB. It is n't likely that it spread at that stage. It is n't impossible (especially if you continue to tan) but it is n't likely it metastisized.######They never mentioned the Breslow depth, just told me the Clark's info and said it was malignant melanoma. I went to my general physician who excised it and sent it off for biopsy. Thank you for responding!######Did you have any other treatment other than the biopsy? Did they do a WLE to get clean margins? Granted a Clarks level II is not as invasive but it still should have required an excision, unless the biopsy got clean margins. But your doctor should have explained it all to you. Just a suggestion, you may want to get a copy of your pathology report for that biopsy and it will have a Breslow depth on it... measured in mm. It is a good idea to keep copies for your own records anyway..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

There was no mention of a type being spreading or nodular... but it started with a mole that suddenly grew into a large kind of blood blister looking thing. Now after some internet research, am worried that it is the nodular type. Would the biopsy normally identify it this way? Or since nothing was said, is it likely to be the less aggressive type? Am trying to decide between regular surgery to remove, or surgery to include sentinel node removal. Thanks for any advice######Hello and sorry your diagnosis brought you here. I have not had a melanoma but have it in my family. I am sure someone will step in and share. Try to stay calm and be careful of reading information on the internet. It is not all from reliable sources. May I ask where your melanoma was on your body? When are you scheduled to have it all removed or talk to you Doctor about it? Usually you will go back into the office and they will remove an area around it and check for what they call Clear Margins... There are several people here who have had melanoma and they will help. I know it is hard but try to keep your mind calm so you can make good decisions. Oleander######Thanks for your words, Oleander53. My melanoma is located on the shoulder area. I 've met with a dermatologist who would do the ``margin surgery '', but he recommended I should consider having the more complete surgery which would include removing & checking the sentinel lymph node. If positive, then removal of additional lymph nodes would be done. I will be meeting with a general surgeon on Monday to discuss this approach. I am leaning this way now, but will decide after talking to the surgeon. Thanks again. Paul######Paul, The boards are usually quiet over weekend. I wanted to tell you my Father had 6 melanomas. YES 6 !!! First one at 58 and his last at age 94. We lost him a year ago. He lived a long and very healthy life. Had it not been for his skin cancers he was great. I want you to see this and know you can have a long life with Melanoma. His were all caught early except his last one on his earlobe and it was agressive probably due to his age. He never had any chemo or radiation. Only surgery to remove the skin around the melanomas. His were never moles but gray to lavender spots that itched. His were back, shoulder, face and neck. He also had Squamous cell, basal cell and Bowen's disease... My brother had his first melanoma 2 years ago at age 58. his was a mole he had all of his life that suddenly changed just a tiny bit. Caught early and he did not need any other treatment but surgery. I have not had a melanoma YET. I have had Squamous Cell, Basal Cell Cancer and Bowen's disease. I had a Squamous Cell Carcinoma in my genital area which makes the SCC more aggressive. So I go to MD Anderson in Houston to be checked out. Mine all started at age 54. By the way Melanomas and other skin cancers can be in the genital areas on both men and women. . everyone should get a mirror and check themselves out once a month. They are on the rise due to tanning beds. I am telling you this so you will know I have experience that worry you feel when you get told you have a serious skin cancer. I have to be looked over every 4 weeks and see the Gynecologist Oncologist every 12 weeks now. Try to stay calm and positive so you can make good decisions. I think if you like your Doctors you should do what they say. That sounds like a good start. Also my Derm put me on Vit D for cancer prevention... They recommend 2000 Units a day with food. I take 5000 units per my Doctor. You might want to consider the 1000 to 2000 units a day. Also always get copies of your Path Reports and any labs. Your medical records belong to you. Good luck and let us know what happens. Sincerely, Oleander######Hi Paul, It seems I 'm a bit late, and I do hope you return and let us know how things are with you. At a depth of 1.2 mm, I 'm not sure you will have a ``choice. '' I 'm sure the surgeon will want to do a wide excision with sentinal node biopsy. There usually is no typing, as far as spreading or nodular, at the time of biopsy. That is usually done after surgery when the pathologist is certain of clear margians and can confidently look at everything under a microscope. I, too, had melanoma. I was stage IB, with a depth of .7 mm. I missed the SNB (the ``magic '' number is 1.0 mm), but there are times I wish I had one. It can give a bit more peace of mind than hoping everything was removed. Anyway, I wish the best for you and really hope you return and let us know how you are!######Hi Chele60, Thanks for your comments. My surgery is scheduled for tomorrow starting at 6:30 AM with radiology where they will inject some nuclear material to locate the sentinel node. The surgery will include its removal and biopsy as well as the wide margin melanoma removal. I 'm going in with confidence they wo n't find any problem in the lymph and this will take care of it. I appreciate your concern & Oleander53, and expect to post some positive news following my surgery. Thanks again, Paul######Thanks for letting us know! I 'll be sending good vibes and thoughts your way. Your melanoma is still fairly thin, and I 'm thinking this is all precautionary. I will be looking forward to that good news!######Please let us know how you do and what you find out. Any surgery can be scary. Try to stay positive. Oleander######My surgery was yesterday morning. Went in at 6:30 AM & they did the radiology thing to locate the lymph nodes, then in to surgery about 10:00. The surgery lasted about 1 1/2 hours, & the surgeon said everything went very well. I 've got a big hole in my shoulder now after 2mm margins, and a smaller hole in my armpit where they took out the node. I 'm feeling fine & not having any problems except the surgery is on the side where I normally sleep, so have to make an adjustment there. I thought the biopsy on the node would be done during the surgery, but was mistaken, and wo n't have the results for a few days. So, it 'll be a little longer before I can hopefully get some good news. Will let you know when I find out. Thanks again Chele60 & Oleander53 for your concerns, Paul######Hi Paul ~ I 'm so glad the surgery went well. That 's good news. Sorry about you having to adjust during sleep, but there 's always something, is n't there? Hopefully the biopsy will come back clear and you will be just fine! I 'll continue to send good vibes your way!######Finally got the results of the post surgery biopsies, & the margins & node all came back clear. Hooray! Thanks Oleander 53 & Chele 60 for your good thoughts & good vibes... they were a great help. Paul######Paul ~ There could n't be better news than that! I 'm so very happy for you!######Great news! So glad for you. I posted a reply to your earlier post & then found your follow-up one. Glad things turned out well for you..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

Melanoma Breslow .99 mm Clark level 3. This was in a previously shaved mole (@ 8 years ago, retired dermatologist no pathology available) I was told then that it was benign, would probably grow back and be darker which it did within the first year. So I forgot about for all this time. My internist noticed it and wanted it rebiopsied, it had gotten a little bigger this past winter, back of my leg so hard to see. Anyway I am concerned about a misdiagnosis, wishing I suppose, of a pseudomelanoma. The pathologist was aware of a previous excised mole at the same site, so do I get another opinion or let the surgeon remove it with the wider margins. I guess I thought that there was nothing to worry about given the fact I had a negative biopsy 8 years ago. Thanks !!######Melanoma can arise from already present mole or from a normal skin. Whenever a mole is removed, there are some mole cells left remaining in the skin, and in rare instances, they may re-grow in a new mole that is usually darker than the previous one. With the shaving method, the chances for this relapse is less than 10% withing few years following the mole removal. Back of the leg is predominant site for melanoma in women, and every mole that changes in its size, shape, or sensations is better to be removed than left. Melanoma with 99 mm due to Breslow scale is melanoma that is less than 1 mm thick belonging to the stage 1, and Clarck 3 means that it has invaded deeper into skin layers, but it 's still contained completely within the skin. Best wishes! Marija######Thanks for the info. Just saw a surgeon who wants to do a sentinel node biopsy with the excision. Are you familiar with that at all? I have to wait till next week.######Get a competent Dermatologist or someone that is completely aware of this and get rid of it now... Do n't mess around...######Sorry to hear about your melanoma. I had it on the top of head 9/11/07. It scared the life out of me. But all worked out okay. I had the sentinel nodes checked out on both side of my neck. They were okay as was the margin of skin they removed. I see a dermatologist every three months, get CT and I am doing great. My friend got it a few months after me. She had no sentinel nodes or margin check out. It came back two time already and she is not doing fine. Get the margin and the setinel node check. Melanoma is a killer. Avoid the sun and use blocker if going in it. You will be okay just get it done right the first time. God bless you. Also make body charts. When you find something on your skin mark it down and bring this paper into you dematologist. Jack######Thanks Jack, I am glad to hear you are doing well! I do n't know of anyone else who has dealt with this so it helps to have your reply. I am scheduled to see the surgeon next week and will do the sentinel node biopsy Do you remember how long you had to wait for the results, the waiting and not knowing is the hardest part. Laura######Right after surgery the doctor told me all looked okay. It took about a week for the biopsy but for the most the doctor knew it was okay. Mine was a .75 mm. I was told I was stage 1A. I had to go to a oncologist too. The first year I got blood work and CT every three months. Now once a year I see the oncologist and get a CT.. I had a lot of sun so the dermatologist had a lot of work. Now my skin is in good shape. But with Clark Level 3, I fear a return. I was told to get it early if it comes back and I will be okay. Also I turned into a health nut.######Hi, left leg upper thigh year 2000. Thought I had a deer tick on me, which turned out to be a mole (melanoma). My Dermo retired as well and I have no idea of stage or size... but it was caught immediately, which made my chances better than good! . This just came up as a tiny black mole. Went to Emory in Atlanta and had it surgically removed, also opted for the sentinnel node biopsy (mine was in groin area) this is done in case a microscopic cell has escaped, it would go to this lymph node. Had 3 removed and all were clean. Had the Mohls (punch done)... a nice 5 inch scar souviner, which is hardly noticeable anymore. I also had bloodwork and chest xray for the first 5 years. I also go EVERY year for a total body scan! SUN BLOCK girlfriend! please feel free to PM if you wish! You 're gon na be great! Hugs!######Thanks Jack and now I have a Fairy Godmother! I appreciate the support so much. I am frustrated because I had this thing removed in 2000, unfortunately it was a shave biopsy and some margins were left and it regrew a melanoma, I only noticed a change in the regrowth this past winter/summer. I do n't even care about the scar, just want it out! I see a surgeon for the removal and node biopsy in the next couple of weeks and then wait for the results Will keep you posted, your kind words mean a lot. Laura######Shave bx's are just that, a shave and always leaves the chance of leaving something behind. Boodesigns, I do hope all turns out well for you. A few of you mentioned sunscreen: This blocks out ALL UV... Blue Lizard. My dad had melanoma years ago on his nose and since then and most recenty he is dealing with skin cancer and uses chemo cream on those areas. I had three small dark/ black spots removed last week and all previous moles I 've had removed minus one have all come back as abnormal... dysplastic and those can turn to melanoma but not all dysplatic moles turn ugly. Does n't help that I 'm fair-skinned and had a horrific sunburn/sun poisoning when I was 18 (now mid-40's)... plus a couple of years of tanning beds early 30's... And I agree with MandMS... melanoma can hide beneath an innocent looking mole or other spots on your skin that are innocent looking. Every 6 months I get spot-checked. In the meantime I apply a mixture of 12 aspirins disolved in clear fingernail polish and apply for 12 weeks (NOT to be used on moles) and if the spots do not disappear then surgical removal would be in order to determine what it is.######Laura, How are you doing? Hope all went well. Jack.######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

Separate from the usual hospital type scenarios. Someone working for ME. I want to pay them DIRECTLY for what they discover or feel the slides represent. I was diagnosed with superficial melanoma, level 2. Could another lab determine that it may have NOT been a correct reading? I asked the plastic surgeon that removed the lesion if it could have been Level 1, to which he replied ``there is no Level 1 ''. And it just makes me wonder. He was the number one ranking plastic surgeon in that area for finding melanoma. Alot of melanoma. There was another woman at the same hospital. Same arm region as me. But hers came back Level III so Doc took some lymph nodes, as well. (She was three rooms down from mine. We met. We talked. She was a bit more upset) He has since left the practice all together 10 years ago. 1996. I was dxd in 1988.######Hello Starry Gal, I am sure you could pay a Pathologist to read your slides... Make sure they are experienced with Skin cancer. You need a Dermatologist Pathologist. I recommend the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Tx. you can do a self referral and mail your slides. I had a questionable Squamous Cell Carcinoma Grade 3 combined with Bowen's disease. It looked like a melanoma and since there is a 4% error in reading Path slides I had it re read. I had it read once by the original hospital Pathologist, 2nd time by a Dermatologist who is a Dermatologist Pathologist, and my 3rd reading was MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Tx. MD Anderson has that program that you can self refer and ask them to re read slides. . That was back in 1/09. The MD Anderson one graded it a 3 which is most likely to spread. But they all came out about the same. SCC is graded different than Melanoma. It is not like the Melanoma Clark's level staging. I have been down a long strange road with this because it was in my genital area and they tend to be more aggressive. I do not have HPV and there is a huge controversy about non HPV vs HPV genital cancer... I was just seen on Weds at MD Anderson Melanoma clinic. I am glad I had it read 3 times because my new Doctor said '' are you sure they were sure it was not a melanoma? '' . GEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZ My Father had 6 melanomas and my brother has had one. I have had several SCC's, Basal CC's and Bowen's... So there is a strong family history. May I ask why you are looking into this after 21 years? Are you having problems now? Hopefully your slides are still available. Let me know how I can help. Oleander######I agree with Oleander. She has been through so much! If you have your slides, you can forward them to MD Anderson- they know just about anything there is to know about melanoma. But, like her, I 'm curious as well. Why are you looking into this after 21 years? Have problems developed? Are you not doing well now? And when you say ``Level 2 ''- do you mean Clark's Level? Or Stage? Clark's Level has been used for a long, long time, and is not all that understandable to the general lay person. Most doctors now set more ``stock '' in the Breslow thickness, and it is much more understandable to the patient. I 'm sure it exists, but I 've seldom, if ever, heard of a Clark's Level I. Most people who are in Stage I melanoma are at least a Clark's Level II. (As a point of reference, I was diagnosed Stage IB, Breslow Thickness .7 mm, and I was Clark's Level IV) Now, if you are talking about Staging, that is very different that Levels. Stages also are determined as I, II, III, IV. At Stage I for melanoma, which is less than 1mm, normally only a wide excision is performed. At Stage II and beyond for melanoma, which is anything 1mm or greater, a wide excision AND a sentinel node biopsy is performed. Again, it 's the thickness of the tumor that comes into play, which is measured by the Breslow thickness. What does Clark's measure? Basically, how deep into the layer of skin the tumor goes into. It used to be the measure doctores set a lot stock by, but not nearly so much by todays standards. So, the question comes down to: were you diagnosed as Clark's Level II or Stage II?.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I had a bcc removed several years ago and went to the doc last May and this was n't even there. The doc said this could double in size every month. I had this removed last week and waiting for the results to whether it was all removed. The doc said I have a 94% survival rate with this. Sounds good be when its you it rocks your world. I will go back next week to have the stitches removed and wondering what should I do to verify it has not spread into the blood system. If nothing is found around the tissue that was removed should I still have a scan and blood work? Also, what are the chances of the melanoma coming back? Thanks, Barry######According to survival rates you were told, I guess you are having an early stage of melanoma. Lymph nodes biopsy of the regional lymph nodes is usually performed to check for local metastases. You should ask to get checked for melanoma metastasis, cause there are cases when thin melanoma has spread distantly. You dermatologist is probably familiar with serological, immunohystochemical and histological prognostic markers. The annual risk of recurrence for tumors < 1.5 mm thick remains < 6% for the first five years dropping to under 1% for the next five years.######I have an appt next week to go back to have follow-up and just talked to nurse. She says that the tissue around the melanoma was free from any cancer and I also asked about the depth and stage etc.. She said it was superficial and lever 3 and the size was 0.51.

Now i feel as if i am eating cardboard every time i put something in my mouth. I suspect it could be the Lisinopril. Has anyone gone thru this?######Angel Pie, Although not common, impaired taste or loss of taste are noted as a side effect of lisinopril. If it 's driving you crazy, talk to your doctor.

It 's the only drug I take. With the exception of cramps that lasted a few days when I first started the drug, I 've never had other side effects. However, for the past 3 weeks, I 've had a cough that I just ca n't get rid of. This cough definitely started because I got sick (I went to the dr.). However, I 've never had a persistent cough this long. I do n't have a fever. I cough up a lot of phlegm still, but the severity of my cough is less severe than when I first got sick. Taking an expectorant helps. I was just curious if you guys think my cough might be related to the lisinopril rather than an illness at this point. I 'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I would like to hear from people who are familiar with the cough side effect from ace inhibitors. Perhaps, you can tell me what the cough is like and how you realized the cough was a drug-related side effect rather than a symptom of an illness. cheers.######I think the cough side effect associated with ace inhibitors is a ``dry cough '', since you mentioned you are still coughing up phlegm its probably related to your recent illness. You might still have a lingering infection, it might be wise to go back to the doctor. What color is the phlegm? It should be white or clear, if its any other color it might be the sign of something more serious.######Throat clearing or cough is a side effect of Lisinopril. I 'm on it and have the same issue. I take a Sudafed every day as my insurance situation is such that I need to stay on the Lisinopril ($ 4 at Walmart) for the time being.######I believe Ace Inhibitors make coughs and congestion worse. A side effect of many Ace Inhibitors/ARB blockers is ``Upper Respiratory Tract Infections ''.######thanks guys. The phlegm is clear. I hope the cough is n't a side effect of the ace inhibitors because I tried a few different types of drugs before settling with ace inhibitors. CCB's and diuretics were intolerable to me because of the side effects. I 'll probably give myself a week to get better and then I 'll go back to the dr.######Just a reminder to people here, people with high blood pressure should be careful what types of cough and cold medicine they take because some of them can raise your blood pressure, such as Sudafed. Coricidin HBP is specially formulated for people with high blood pressure.######someone on this thread shared a secret as to how to get rid of that pesty dry cough from Ace inhibitors but I can not remember who it was. I read it several months ago...######The main side effect of Ace Inhibitors is a dry nagging cough. I also had a tickle in my throat sometimes. Cozaar also gave me the throat tickle but no cough.

So, most recently, my doctor added Lisinopril to my medication regimen, to lower the blood pressure. I had previously been on Metoprolol, and quit taking that because it- and all other medications in the Toprol family of drugs- caused extreme drowsiness for me. I was to a point where I could not function. Knowing this, my doctor gave me Lisinopril. I am not sure if this is effective or not yet, as it has been less than a month I have been on this drug. However, she did tell me a common side effect was a dry cough. Well, I seem to have developed a very severe, dry, hacking cough that is really bothersome sometimes. I am wondering if anyone else on Lisinopril out there could tell me... if they got this side effect, too- does it diminish over time? Or does it stay bad? Is the effect of the drug worth the distress of this dry cough? Is there any other medication that might be substituted, which would not have the dry cough side effect? Certainly, ceasing blood pressure medication is not an option for me, I really DO need to do something about the blood pressure... and medication seems to be the only thing that helps. But I am wondering about the undesireable side effects... if they decrease over time... or if there is something else out there with less side effects?######Hi yes there is a book out there with natural things mentioned to help this with likely little or no side effects.######Do you mind telling me what this book is, and where I might find a copy?######Hi there! yes! The name of the book is ``Natural Treatments for Hypertension '' by Agatha Thrash, M.D. & Calvin Thrash, M.D. T######If your systolic is around 100, this is no longer high BP, why do you want to have it lower ?? Lisinopril belongs to the ACE inhibitors type of medicaments, all of them produce cough, the fact is that some people are less sensible to that and other more... if you are sensible to that, it will not go away with time. The logical alternative is to change to an ARA type of medicament like Losartan or Valsartan. Jesus######Calee, did you mean the lower number is 100? The upper number is the systolic and it should be around 120. The lower number they try to keep at 80 or below... the diastolic. As for the cough with lisinopril, I had the exact same problem (started bringing on asthma attacks!) with a different ACE inhibitor and changed to lisinopril and it went away so ask about trying another one. It may only be that particular drug in the family that does it. You wo n't know until you try. We all react differently to each drug within a class of drugs and you have to ``sample them '' unfortunately. I take 40mgs of lisinopril a day. I had a similar problem with calcium channel blockers except the problem was depression. Verapamil, at maximum doses, caused severe depression. Even when lowered to half the max., I still struggled. Tried amlodipine and it still happened. Then I tried diltiazem and no problems at all. And it even controlled my problem with PVC's (extra beats) better than the beta blocker that was supposed to control it. Sometimes you just have to try different drugs for a month at a time and see what works for you. Ask your doc about giving you a 2-4 week supply of samples so you can see what side effects you have with that particular drug. If it 's okay, then get another month by script. Once you get through 2 months okay, go for it. Once you figure out what your ``customized '' drug regime is, you 'll be much happier and your pressure will respond accordingly. good luck............ Jenny######Yeah, I fowled up. . The lower number, DIASTOLIC is around 100. The systolic is usually around 140. I might try some of these suggestions with my doctor next time I go.######I tried Lisinopril also and had a terrible cough and congestion. I am now taking Ramipril/ Altace and have not yet had a problem with it. I am on a very low dose though. I also tried Losartan and was so, so sick.######Is Ramipril/Altace another ACE inhibitor? If so... and if it works for you... and if the Lisinopril proves to be working for me, next time I go to my doctor, I might ask about switching. This cough is truly awful... I get this hacking cough that sounds like I 'm about to bring up a lung!######Yes ramipril is another ace. I had a terrible reaction to Lisinopril but, so far, the ramipril is agreeing with me. I have only been taking it a week and I am on the lowest dose because I have to start that way to have any hope of adapting. I am hugely sensitive to meds and have chunked about a half dozen BP meds.######Labetalol is a quick action beta alpha blocker. It does cause drowiness. One way around that is to take it in smaller doses throughout the day. Start with a lower dose & work up.######I have taken the Ace Inhibitor Accupril (generic: Quinapril) for many years with no serious side effects. My Cardiologist prescribed it because I have asthma, and Quinapril is supposed to be better for Asthmatics. Hey !? Today is Christmas!

Would it be a big deal to switch to lisperniol? (sp) Would it really mess with my bp? I believe it 's a totally different med from what I take. The reason I woukld like to switch is for 2 reasons. 1. There has been a study showing lispernol could benefit people with my disease. Something about T cells 2. Even though my doctor denies that azor causes weight gain, everytime I stop taking the med, I lose weight really fast, i go back on it and it creeps up.######You should tell your doctor that you would like to try lisinopril because of the benefits discovered. Azor is a combination of Amlodipine and Benicar which is a calcium blocker and angiotensin blocker. Lisinopril is an Ace Inhibitor similar to Benicar. The main side effect of Ace Inhibitors is a nagging cough. You need to speak to your doctor regarding the Lisinopril because it is a different class of drug..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

I had taken lisinopril for 2 years and clonidine for a little over a year. The clonidine worked but was sedating and had sexual side effects I do n't care to live with. It 's only my third day but I feel like myself before HBP and the meds. My head is clear and I have some energy again. My HBP comes along with a quick pulse so this alpha blocker is the best solution for me. Also helps with some mild PTSD and anxiety. I usually get side effects quick, so far so good. Could it be that I have found the one for me finally.######Wow, I hope it works for you!######Lynette57, How is the tenex working? Do you take it at night? Just curious. I am still looking for the right med for me.######I did take it at night. It was n't as effective as the clonidine. The reason I am looking for a new one is the sexual side effects. I felt less drugged on the tenex. But the side effect was still there. My doc prefers the ace inhibitors due to the protection of the kidneys. My father is 82 had high blood pressure since his early 50's He is healthy and strong. So I can see that the ace is a good thing for my genetics. The lisinopril worked great with the exception of leg pain. So I recently tried the Lotensin brand he takes. Switched over slowly over a week. Yesterday late morning I had a major hypertensive event. Pulse and BP out of control. Had to take some xanax to get it down quick. Got it back under control with lisinopril and small clonidine dose. My adrenals have been messed up since I had 2 steroid injections in my back. I am learning that there is a good chance that one medication alone wo n't take care of the cause.######Lynette 57, I took lisinopril for several years, but it stopped working. Go figure !!! I then tried tekturna and I could not take the side effects. Next, I tried amlodopine, which made me feel sick, gave me swollen ankles, and made me tired, but controlled my pressure. I recently weaned from it in order to try lotensin. I just took myself off of it this past Sunday. I could n't take the side effects. I am back on the amlodopine until I see my dr tomorrow. I hope the lotensin works for you. Good luck with it..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Iwent back to see my doctor a couple of days ago and he said it was from the Lisinopril and took me off of that and started me on Diovan HCT 80/12 .5 mg. My question has anyone had this problem and if so how long did the cough last after stopping the Lisinopril? BTW one of the side effect of Diovan is ``COUGHING '' LOL KEN######I have been on many combinations of blood pressure medications, for years. I have resigned to take the coughing, as the blood pressure regulation is so much more important an issue. In my case though, the coughing is not that irriating, so I live with it. Best ot you.######I was on Lisinopril and developed the cough. After stopping Lisinopril, the cough subsided and was tolerable after two to three days. It was totally gone in a few weeks. I did not develope the cough on Diovan HCT.######I too had the cough on lisinopril. In my case it was really, really bad. Switched to Diovan. The cough went away within about two weeks. I still have some coughing issues on Diovan (some do) but it 's totally tolerable. Do n't you just hate it when you end up being one of the 1/3 of people who get this. For everyone else they get a med that works wonders and is dirt cheap. On the FYI side, Diovan goes off patent in the 2011 timeframe######Was your coughing mostly at night?######As for timing of cough it differs. Mine was mid-day as I took the medication in the morning. My cleaning lady was night-time as she took her dose before she went to bed. Varies for all people. It 's not something you do n't know you have. For some you 're coughing so badly you ca n't catch your breath. For others it turns into a gag cough where keeping food down is hard (me). If you get massive (and I do mean massive) coughing when on any of the ACE Inhibitors you 're done for. It 's about whether or not you can deal with the side effects. Frustrating. That medication had the best results for me. Ugh.######This horrible cough seems to be very prevalent when taking Lisinopril from what I 've read on the Internet. My doctor took me off of it 2 weeks ago when I complained and said that it might take 2 weeks to get rid of the cough. Well, no such luck. It is still just like it was. I 've read on here that it can take a month or more. So good luck! .... sfflorajean######Developed high BP a couple of years ago and was always researching ways how to fix it with natural means. However after being able to look at high BP in a different way I recognized the many dangers that people have to develop high BP that have more to do with their live style. For me, getting rid of family members that could more accurately be described as vultures and criminals has helped tremendously. Saying adieu to my ex and all the wan na be's has lowered by BP to the point of almost not having to take any prescription meds at all. Noticed after one day only of cutting my Lisinopril into a fourth of the prescribed med chest pains completely disappeared. Life ``Quality '' Expectancy will be much more promising from now on. People always look at what they eat and if they exercise and those things are very important. But people who do not eliminate stressor people around them often are doomed to take BP meds and continue to worsen. Just a thought. Life style changes includes getting people out of your life that are stress factors.

We all know the long term effects of having HBP and not treating it, but are there long term effects from the drugs? I 'm sure they are less problematic than untreated blood pressure, but I was just curious...######I know that with me and my diuretic I used it for 2 years with no problems at all until one day I started cramping up terribly and went to the ER. Turns out I had low magnesium from the diuretic. It apparently gradually reduced magnesium in my body until I hit some critical threshold.######My mother has been on a variety of HBP medications since she was 40. She is now 77. She is very concious of her health and has always regularly visited doctors. If one med stopped working well enough, they would switch her over. After 37 years on the meds she is still going strong, going out dancing and staying out until all hours and taking aerobics and other exercise classes. Find a med that works, and a doctor you can trust. Long term on the meds is probably not a big risk for the majority of people.######My father is now 70 years old and he runs 12 km 3 times weekly, he has high blood pressure since he was 15 but started medication at 37 and he has been on many different medications for blood pressure. He 's healthy and strong, sometimes I feel that he 's younger than me. I ca n't say that all high BP drug classes are safe, in fact I do n't know much about that but I 'm sure that everyone can find a good medication for him/her. Good luck, Michael######Ronnie, One no-so-long-term effect of ACE inhibitors (like lisinopril) is that the body finds ways to work around them. Usually within a year, the effect of an ACE inhibitor is compromised because the body enhances angiotensin-2 production using the enzyme, chymase, instead of ACE. At that point another agent must be used; wisely, INSTEAD of the ACEI, but more usually, in ADDITION to it. An even worse approach is to keep upping the dose of the drug as it becomes ineffective..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

So the day before yesterday I missed taking a tablet. Yesterday my leg seemed almost to be better. But before going to bed I took a tablet. Now today it 's got worse again, although not as bad as say about 3 or 4 days ago. But these ace inhibitors (lininopril) are only 2.5 mg. They go up to 40mg! Mind you they 've had a dramatic effect on my blood pressure. (It 's ``normal '' now). So I have 2 questions: a) Is it that it might be this ``lininopril '' causing this condition? b) Given that it is at least is it at all likely? I 'm seeing my doctor on Wednesday, but unsure as to whether I should take a tablet today and tomorrow. Much obliged for any responses.######I would suspect the lisiniopril is causing the leg pain !! I experienced excrutiating back pain and shoulder pain while on 25 mg lisinopril. The back pain was so severe I would take my phone to bed with me because I did n't know whether or not I would be able to get out of the bed in the am. The shoulder pain was not that severe but serious enough for my physical therapist to tell me that I was not to lift anything over 3 pounds. I had blamed my back pain due to an injury I had experienced 40 yrs prior (the meds were messing with my brain at this point) but I had not experienced any abuse or injury with the shoulder. My doctor did n't id the pain as a side effect of the lisinopril but fortunately for me prescribed (at my request) physical therapy instead of more medication. My shoulder and back pain disappeared immediately and completely after discontinuing lisinopril. It was n't until I began reading these boards that I realized other people had experienced muscle/nerve/bone pain (some so severe they ended up in er rooms) while taking this drug. If at all possible, work with your doctor to use the DASH diet, to exercise, and to use other non drug treatments so may be able to get off meds. Meds can be lifesavers but they can also make your life unbearable as you may now know. Good luck and good health! Bethsheba######I am having the same pains in my legs and also on the right side of my hip more toward my back. I was scared thought maybe my kidney is messed up. I have been on Lisinopril for about 5 months. I am glad I came across your post. At least I can tell my Dr others are having the same symptoms. I wonder if it will go away after a while? I hate to change meds again..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

The past two months it went down to 140/80. I went yesterday to get it checked agian and it was up again. It was 140/96. My doctor said that if it was up next month that he will add another medication to bring it down. I am already on ACE inhibitor and Calcium Channel blocker. Is any one on 3 medications for their high blood pressure? What type of medications could he add to the other two? I am also on 5 other medications for my rheumatoid arthritis. I am only 32 and I do n't want to take any more medications.######Annette, He should replace on of the two meds with a diuretic rather than adding a third. A welcome side effect of the diuretic is that it will help with any joint swelling from the arthritis. Anyone who is on three Rx for BP should definitely have one of them be a diuretic. I think the same applies to anyone on just two. Lots of people take an ACEI and a thiazide with good results. In fact, that 's what most of the OTC meds for back pain are (like Doan's pills), just herbal diuretics to remove water and decrease the pressure on inflamed nerves.######My mom suffers with severe bp problems, her bp has been known to go as high as 234/106 and higher. She had great results with lisinopril 20, hctz 25, verapamil 240. then she became allergic to lisinopril and was taken off ater seven yrs. Now she takes clonidine .03 3x daily, verapamil 120 1x daily, and occasionally a diuretic called torsemide. Yesterday her bp was 130/70. We 're hoping this continue som my mom does n't have such high numbers, which is horrible on the kidneys. Good luck.######When I was first diagnosed with high BP, i just took one medication. It did n't improve the BP, so I now take a beta blocker along with a diuretic. I would still like to see my BP lowered, so I 'm trying to watch my diet and walk more, now that it 's so nice out..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Please take a look at my posts. I today received a very informative reply from a lady who said that my symptoms could be fibromyalgia. My main symptoms are (sorry there are quite a few, at the risk of sounding like a hyperchondriac): waking with numb arm and leg; tingling in limbs; `vibration ' going through body; heavy feet (especially left); pins and needles in hands and feet; cramps; muscle spasms; tremor in left index and little finger; VERY troublesome tinnitus in left ear only; dizziness; lightheadedness; feeling off-balance; pressure in head; pressure behind left eye and unequal pupil dilation; slight headache on left side; extreme fatigue; nausea; night sweats; no energy; anxiety; depression sometimes (not surprising!) ; blurred vision. I know I sound like a basket case, but this is why I NEED to get to the bottom of what 's going on! I also, about 15 years ago, woke up and could n't walk. I called out a doctor; went for tests but no reason was found. I also have woken up twice with very blurred vision, which returned to normal after a few hours leaving just pain. What I 'd like to know is, does this sound like fibromyalgia, and if so, is it normal to have fibromyalgia without a lot of pain, as I assumed that fibromyalgia was a very painful condition, and I do n't suffer a great deal of pain, apart from the heavy legs and extreme tired body and mind feeling. I 'd be very grateful for any advice, as I am at my wits' end.

Anyone have this?######Fibromyalgia is not a mental condition. It is a true disease or syndrome. I do n't know a huge amount but I do know that they test you by putting pressure on like 14? different pressure points and seeing if you have pain in them. Fibromyalgia is very painful, and I wish you all the best... do a search on it and you will get lots of info!######Did the search for you... Fibromyalgia syndrome (or fibromyalgia) is a chronic disorder associated with widespread muscle and soft tissue pain, tenderness, and fatigue. A person with fibromyalgia will experience pain when up to 18 specific areas called tender/trigger points are pressed. Pushing carefully on these specific trigger points during an examination causes discomfort or sharp pain. The cause of fibromyalgia is not known. Fibromyalgia has been recognized as a medical disorder only since the 1980s, although there is evidence it may have existed for centuries .1 The pain of fibromyalgia is more than normal muscle aches common after physical exertion. Fibromyalgia often can be severe enough to disrupt a person's daily work and activities. Other symptoms that commonly occur with fibromyalgia include: Unrestful sleep. Fatigue. Morning stiffness. Less common symptoms or conditions that can accompany fibromyalgia include: Headache. Raynaud's syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome (present in about one-half of those with fibromyalgia) .2 Depression. Fibromyalgia can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to many other disorders and diseases. There are no lab tests to diagnose fibromyalgia. It is often diagnosed after other conditions have been ruled out. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed when :3 A person has had widespread pain for at least 3 months. To be considered ``widespread, '' the pain must be both above and below the waist and on both sides of the body. At least 11 of 18 specific tender points are painful when pressed. (Because symptoms vary widely from person to person, some people with fibromyalgia may have fewer painful tender points.) Fibromyalgia is not a psychological condition, although it has some psychological components. As with many conditions that cause chronic pain, anxiety and depression are common in people with fibromyalgia and may make symptoms worse. While there is no specific cure for fibromyalgia, symptoms of this syndrome can be treated. If you have fibromyalgia, taking an active role in your treatment is very important to managing your condition. Treatment may be different for each individual. It can include: Medications to help you sleep better and to relieve pain. Exercise therapy to help with muscle aches and stiffness. Counseling to help you manage chronic pain.######Thanks Alison, I found a couple sites about it & copied the imfo. Your a doll to go to such effort for me.

The 5 docs I 've been to in the UK did n't believe that FMS even existed so I 've gone along with the diagnosis of chronic pain. All my symptoms seem very mild in comparison to those I 've read about on here, but they are still very difficult. My symptoms are: Varying pain in several sites around my body particularly knees, hips, shoulders. less so in wrists, ankles, and neck. Depression. IBS varying between constipaiton and diahrea. Memory and cognitive impairment. waking up stiff. Sleeping for long hours (usually 12 hours) Waking up feeling like I need to sleep more. stress-headaches. Please help and thanks for reading.######You sound so much like me in your description of your symptoms. I have FMS. I really sympathize with you not being able to find a Doctor that believes you. It took me some time to find one, but I finally did. Keep trying to find a Doc that believes you. I had one Doc tell me I was just depressed! I 'm not very bad in my symptoms but it is SO frustrating when you ca n't get any help. Keep trying to find a Doc who believes you, it makes all the difference. Good luck and God Bless. I 'll say a prayer for you.######FMS (Fibromyalgia Syndrome) is also known by another name, ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis). ME is the term used in the UK. FMS is the term used in the USA.######Thank you both! La_brat, I did n't realize that ME was the same thing, friends at university have asked if that was what I had, but I always thought it was FMS. Strange to think they are the same thing. Another symptom that I have started getting which I was wondering if it was related... Sometimes my lungs feel like I 've just run for half an hour even though I 've spent most of the time sitting or moving slowly. Anyone else had this problem?######Hello, Do a search for my user name and check out my posts. And yea I used to have your symptoms and MANY more. Sometimes I feel autoimmune attacks during the late afternoon or evening that cause my shoulders to feel weak and tingling. That can be a major nuisance for me. (This message has been edited by batman777 (edited 11-17-2002) .)######Hi La_brat, I 've been doing a quick bit of research and the sites that I 've been able to find seem to describe ME as Chronic Fatigue stating that the fatigue is the worst symptom. At the moment, the pain is the worst part.######You 'll find that the only difference, here, between Chronic Fatigue Syndrone and FMS is the number of tender points the doctor finds. If the doctor finds, (of this I am not sure) 11 out of 18, you have FMS. It does n't matter which of the symptoms are most pronounced. Our youngest daughter is diagnosed with FMS, but has little pain and has a lot of fatigue. Our eldest daughter, also diagnosed with FMS, has about equal pain and fatigue. They both have most of the other symptoms listed for CFIDS and FMS to varying degrees. None of the symptoms have we found an originator as of yet.######hi i live in the uk i have suffered 10 year with cronic joint pain and have only now been diagnosed with fms a lot of doctors do not believe it exists up untill a few year ago, i got really depressed and demanded to see a ruematolagist and was recently diagnosed. when i do simple things like iron or hoover my hands swell up are very very painful before i got diagnosed i started to think it was all in my head x######Sure sounds like fibro to me. I had it for years before I got help from doctors, so hang in there. You need to find the right doctor, who not only believes you, but is willing to try different things until you find something that works for you. It might take a lot of trial and error. And, even when doctors believe you, they are not always good at treating you in a way that does n't make you feel crazy. So just know that and stick to your guns and find someone good for you. I 've gotten help and can maintain an ok level of functioning most of the time. Still, when things get bad or there is a change, I still have to ``fight '' my doctors a bit. However, I just found a new one that really listened to me, took me seriously, and is willing to try things.######Hello, I 'm a Newbie too but never had the time to even check out this health board til recently while I googled tiny red spots under the skin and one of the results was with FM. So I clicked on it and here I was. I believe your symptoms can very well be FMS... but one thing to ask have u been tested and everything else ruled out like Lupus & MS? If not you may want to see a specialist/Rheumatologist and get test ran so you are sure of what you have. If it is FMS then be thankful that your symptoms do n't seem so severe Good luck with your search! It seems like all symptoms I have and I def have a severe case of it. You have got a few good responses so far esp that one bout in the UK that FMS is ME. That 's great info for you. Hope all goes well, ~ FML ~.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

I have a lot of headaches-sometimes migraines and sometimes my whole face hurts and is very tender. This can last for days with sore muscles in my shoulders, my breastbone and sometimes my whole back. I am usually worse when a storm is approaching or if the weather changes drastically. I have been to so many doctors and none of them really know what to say. I have anxiety a lot because I have to say no to a lot of the things I used to do because I hardly ever feel good. I went to a doctor yesterday who says I have panic disorder but I feel there is more to it than that. Sometimes when I get up in the morning I am stiff all over and I think I am a little young for that. Any advice ?? Is this hereditary because my grandmother has it? Thank you######Have you had a MRI of your brain? - Many people with Pineal gland problems have similiar symptoms.######Yes I had an mri about two years ago. They did n't see anything to be concerned about then.

However even when I am relaxed and the weather turns I feel crappy too-or if I do too much. Who knows? I will keep searching for the answer. Thanks.######I am taking the following to control my FM symptoms with excellent results: low dose naltrexone (LDN), melatonin, pregnenolone (not a steroid), vinpocetine, and oddly enough Veinotonic II (very important). Unfortunately I have not found anything to control my crackling joints. You can find information on internet on all of the above.######. (This message has been edited by tolern (edited 08-23-2003) .)######I have a perception that if I take more pregnenolone, the crackling of my joints is reduced.######can you describe what crackling of the joints mean? thanks, eckie Beckie######On a physiological level I ca n't tell you what 's going on. But the symptoms of my joints crackling are when I move- many of my joints, make a crackling noise. And yes I am religious about saying that FM people should try Low Dose Naltrexone (see some of my posts) to reduce their symptoms. The earlier-the better to nip the disease in the bud.######Here is what I found in my online research for Fibromyalgia: Symptoms and Syndromes: As well as pain and fatigue, patients can have a number of symptoms and syndromes that are currently associated with FMS and can experience one or more of the following: Chest Symptoms: Individuals with fibromyalgia who engage in activities involving continuous, forward body posture such as typing, sitting at a desk, etc. often have special problems with chest and upper body pain known as thoracic pain and dysfunction. Often accompanying the pain is shallow breathing and postural problems. Patients may also develop a condition called costochondralgia, which involves muscle pain where the ribs meet the chest bone. Such conditions may mimic heart disease and are therefore sometimes misdiagnosed. Anyone experiencing chest pain should always consult a physician immediately. Persons with fibromyalgia are also prone to a largely asymptomatic heart condition known as mitral valve prolapse or MVP in which one of the valves of the heart bulges during a heartbeat causing a click or murmur. MVP usually does not cause much concern in FMS patients unless another cardiac condition is also present. Cognitive Disorders: Persons with FMS report a number of cognitive symptoms which tend to vary from day to day. These include difficulty concentrating, spaciness, short term memory lapses, and being overwhelmed easily. Many fibromyalgia patients refer to such symptoms as fibro fog. Depression And Anxiety: Although FMS patients are frequently misdiagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders, research has repeatedly shown that fibromyalgia is not a form of depression or hypochondriasis. However, where depression or anxiety exist concomitant to fibromyalgia, their treatment is important as both can exacerbate FMS and interfere with successful symptom management. Dysequilibrium: FMS patients may be troubled by light-headedness and or balance problems which manifest themselves in a number of ways. Since fibromyalgia is thought to affect the skeletal tracking muscles of the eyes, nausea or visual confusion may be experienced when driving a car, reading a book, or otherwise tracking objects. Difficulties with smooth muscles in the eye may also cause additional problems with focus. Weak muscles and or trigger points in the neck or TMJ problems in the jaw may also cause dizziness or dysequilibrium. Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Center have also shown that some FMS patients have a condition known as neurally mediated hypotension, which causes a drop in blood pressure and heart rate upon standing with resulting light headedness, nausea, and difficulty thinking clearly. Environmental Sensitivity: Hypersensitivity to light, noise, odors, and weather patterns is common and is usually explained as being a result of the hypervigilance seen in the nervous systems of patients with FMS. Neurogenic inflammation, a discrete, localized inflammatory response which does not activate the immune response or show up in tests, seems to play a part in the itching and rashes seen in FMS. Allergic like reactions to a variety of substances such as medications, chemicals, food additives, pollutants, etc. are common, and patients may also experience a form of non allergic rhinitis consisting of nasal congestion, discharge and sinus pain, but in the absence of the immunologic reactions which the body experiences in allergic conditions. Gastrointestinal Complaints: Digestive disturbances, abdominal pain, and bloating are quite common in FMS as are constipation and or diarrhea, also known as irritable bowel syndrome or IBS. In addition, patients may have difficulty swallowing food which research suggests is a result of objective abnormalities in smooth muscle functioning in the esophagus. Genito-Urinary Problems: FMS patients may experience increased frequency of urination or increased urgency to urinate, typically in the absence of a bladder infection. Some may develop a more chronic, painful inflammatory condition of the bladder wall known as interstitial cystitis or IC. Women with FMS may have more painful menstrual periods or experience worsening of their FMS symptoms during this time. Conditions such as vulvar vestibulitis or vulvodynia, characterized by a painful vulvar region and painful sexual intercourse, may also develop in women. Increased Headaches Or Facial Pain: Fibromyalgia patients may experience frequent migraine, tension, or vascular headaches. Pain may also consist of referred pain to the temporal area, temples or behind the eyes. Approximately one third of patients with fibromyalgia are thought to have pain and dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, or TMJ, located where the jaw meets the ear, which produces not only headaches but also jaw and facial pain. Leg Sensations: Some FMS patients may develop a neurologic disorder known as restless legs syndrome or RLS which involves an irresistible urge to move the legs particularly when at rest or when lying down. One recent study reported that 31 percent of the fibromyalgia patients studied had RLS. The syndrome may also involve periodic limb movements during sleep or PLMS which can be very disruptive to both the patient and to his or her sleeping partner. Paresthesia: Numbness or tingling, particularly, in the hands or feet, sometimes accompanies FMS. Also known as paresthesia, the sensation can be described as prickling or burning. Sleep Disturbances: Despite sufficient amounts of sleep, FMS patients may awaken feeling unrefreshed, as if they have barely slept. Alternatively, they may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Some also suffer from the condition, sleep apnea. The reasons for the non-restorative sleep and other sleep difficulties of fibromyalgia are unknown. However, early FMS research in sleep labs documented disruptions in the deep or delta sleep of some fibromyalgia patients. Skin Complaints: Nagging symptoms, such as itchy, dry, or blotchy skin, may accompany FMS. Dryness of the eyes and mouth is also not uncommon. Additionally, fibromyalgia patients may experience a sensation of swelling, particularly in extremities, like fingers. A common complaint is that a ring no longer fits on a finger. Such swelling, however, is not equivalent to the joint inflammation of arthritis, rather, it is a localized anomaly of FMS whose cause is currently unknown. Stiffness: Body stiffness may be particularly apparent upon awakening and after prolonged periods of sitting or standing in one position or coincide with changes in temperature or relative humidity. Temperature Sensitivity: Persons with fibromyalgia tend to be highly sensitive to ambient temperature. Some often feel abnormally cold, compared to others around them, while others feel abnormally warm. An unusual sensitivity to cold in the hands and or feet, accompanied by color changes in the skin, sometimes occurs in persons with fibromyalgia. This condition is known as Raynauds Phenomenon. Official Diagnostic Criteria & Tpoints Graphic: Fibromyalgia syndrome has had a long, if rather obscure, history as an illness and has existed throughout history and throughout the world. In 1990, official diagnostic criteria for FMS were established by the American College of Rheumatology or ACR. They include the following: History of Widespread Pain: Chronic, widespread, musculoskeletal pain for longer than three months in all four quadrants of the body. Widespread pain means pain above and below the waist and on both sides of the body. In addition, axial skeletal pain, in the cervical spine, anterior chest, thoracic spine, or low back, must be present. Pain in 11 of 18 Tender Point Sites on Digital Palpation: There are 18 tender points that doctors look for in making a fibromyalgia diagnosis. According to the ACR requirements, a patient must have 11 of the 18 to be considered as having fibromyalgia. Approximately four kilograms of pressure or approx. 9 lbs. must be applied to a tender point, and the patient must indicate that the tender point locations are painful. Thus: As the ACR criteria suggest, a fibromyalgia diagnosis requires the hands on evaluation of a patient by a medical professional skilled in fibromyalgia diagnosis. Since patients are not always aware of the specific anatomical origins of pain in their bodies, self diagnosis is not advised. I also suggest that you get the following book which will help you greatly if you are diagnosed with fibromyalgia: ``Fibromyalgia & Chronic Mayofascial Pain Syndrome A Survival Manual '' Devin Starlanyl, M.D. Co Written with Mary Ellen Copeland, M.S., M.A. Good Luck & let us know what you find out. Check our Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as well for these two syndromes are very simular and sometimes go hand in hand with each other. There is still research being done on this and has been done. 4eversick######You need to find a good arthritis doctor at this time. They can help you with this. Dgrams949######O.K, I really need help. I do n't know what I have and I will list my symptoms: 1) my muscles/joint hurt me all the time (all over my body: shoulders/arms/legs/ foot/knee, where not? . 2) My fingers hurting me as I 'm writing this. 3) I feel like I have needles in my body all the time or like I have some sort of hurting sand in my body. 4) Anemic (I 've taken iron for 3 months already). 5) Dry eyes sometimes dry lips not a dry mouth though. 6) Feeling weak all of the time. 7) My vision gets worst all the time without apparent explanation. (not genetics). 8) Dry eyes. 9) sometimes I feel like numbness on my feet hands etc. 10) Rarely I feel chest pain but that chest pain is like the other pain I have. 11) One time I felt like I have electricity all over my body! 12) sometimes my cloth hurt me (when I wear my pants) But not all the time. I feel them like. I 've done a blood test that showed no reumtologic thing in it and no thyroid problem. Could it be Fibromylagia? . Please help me it makes me depressed. What can I do aginst this horrible pain? . Thanks.######Definately sounds like Fibromyalgia to me. I was diagnosed over ten years ago, and recently had the worst flareup ever, after a very stressful event, actually a breakdown. I have mostly anxiety syndrome, but depression follows. My main problem at this point is in my feet... ca n't stand or walk for long. It is so hard, the brain fog lost me my last job. Hang in there, many doctors know it and can help you.######could it be osteorithis also?######Hi, I am sorry to hear of all of the symptoms you are having. I believe you as I have experienced everything you mention on your list. I was diagnosed in 95 with Systemic Lupus, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I have never had a postive test for Rheumatoid Arthritis. I am interested to hear if any Doc has done a ESR, commonly known as a Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or a ANA, also known as a anti nuclear antibody. As you may know there is no one test to rule in or rule out Lupus, this is done by looking at your symptoms and at the least the two blood test I mentioned. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome of symptoms and it can be very debilitating. I had to go on Disability from my Career as a Nurse, which I dearly Loved due to Lupus and Fibromyalgia. I have a lot of other medical problems as well. I also have the severe dry eyes and mouth... I had to have punctal plugs put in my eyes per the opthamologist, a lot of patients with auto immune illness get sicca syndrome which caused dry eyes and dry mouth or one or the other. I also have to use a saliva substitue from time to time. I came here because I found out just yesterday that I now have low thyroid and had to go on medication for that as well. I wish you the best, Do continue to look for a Doctor that will consider your entire list of symptoms. Burning pain is common with many illnesses, can indicate that there is a problem with the nerves in your body or also known as Neuropathy. The things I have mentioned are suggestions and I urge you to find a Doctor that will do a complete work up on you. I didnt find that a Rheumatologist was best for me, I have received better care from a Internal Med Doc,, that is just my personal experience. Wishing you Hope and that you will have answers soon. Hugs, KaySara######Thank you KaySara, I have a question for you please or anybody please! . Am I allowed to have social security pension because I have fibromyaglia? . It 's difficult for me to work. My fingers hurt me all the time together with my whole body. also, I decided not to take iboprofen because it may cause liver damage (saw on t.v.). So I 'm living with this pain on a daily basis. Sometimes I feel like life do n't worth living with so much pain.######Also, which is something I do n't understand. When my (probably) fibromyaglia attack ends I 'm feeling like fever. It feels like I 'm ill. I ``m so happy about that feeling because than the pain subsides. Oh my.######Hello, My advice to you would be not to self diagnose yourself with Fybro or CFS. They are very tricky illnesses. The reasone that Fybro and CFS have so many symtoms is because you can have any symptom in the world and if all your test come back negative and positve for pressure points than you have a doctor tell you you have fybro or cfs. If you are sick and the doctors ca n't pin point any cause or reasone, except pressure points then they will diagnose you with fybro and/or cfs for the time being or for as long as you still have no positives or causes. I think it 's important to let a doctor you trust diagnose you with a illness of that nature. And you feel that, that doctor will work hard and understand your symtoms. And work with you to feel comfortable. Always make sure you can trust your doctors words. And that he will help you to your best benifits For more advice in detail I would like you to go to a post I made a little while ago called ``For those who are newly diagnosed with Fybro or cfs, Or those curious '' You can view them by going through the post that my screan name has put out. Good luck, Concetta (Con-ch-etta) P.S. For those of you that do n't like what my oppions are DO N'T READ AND PLEASE DO N'T RESPOND! I AM INTITLED TO MY OWN PERSONAL ADVICE AND I AM NOT IN HERE FOR DEBATES!######Oh O.K.but I feel like I ``m a candidate for it. I had a prolong stress all my life and a huge trauma. I have an appointment in one month. I will have to live with this horrible pain for a month. Hell, I wish it 's not fibro. Living like this forever? . I do n't want. I like to walk !!!! . Now I can not walk, I can not sit, I hardly do stuff. This illness is untreatable and that keeps me wondering and wandering. 33 years old.######Iwantacure, I understand! Hope you feel better too. Especially if you need to get things done it must be hard! I understand completly. Stress can bring on any type of symtoms or illness. Thats so sad that sometimes you ca n't avoid stress and it makes you sick. For me I had 2 young grandparents die and I had a baby all within 3 months apart so the overload of stress brought out a dormate disease in my body. Which for me was Lyme disease with the coinffection Batonella. Which I am still haveing soooo many problems with getting accurate test results. But TaKe CaRe !!!! And good luck.

Just so you know. There is something worse than fibromyalgia (sory I dont ' like to call it fibro). Me, they diagnosed with fibromyaliga but without ANY tender points so I dont ' know what I have but i know I have pain all over the muslces of my body. BUT try Chronic neck pain ----- People that is WORSE so much worse. If I had to choose fibromyalgia or chronic neck pain 24 hours a day I will choose fibromyalgia. At least you can more or less cope with it. Neck has nerve intersection and any little problem like Whiplash can hurt the soft tissue for life even if it 's only muscle pain. It 's INCURABLE. All those doctors are for only prescribing pain killers but not cure soft tissue damage. For years this whiplash been around and they can not do anything about it. The hell with those cars. You just need sleeping pills all the time with neck pain cause you can not rest your neck on the pillow. In one moment your life can change. So bless your luck, you could have fibromyalgia and chronic neck pain and no sleep at all.######Hugs to you. Sounds like you are having a rough time at the moment.

Due to this her family has decided to move to West Virigina because disability is easier to get there. Her husband is going to move in w/ me and my boyfriend untill he can pay off some bankruptcy morgage on the house they now live in and he has a good job here paying alot more than any job he could find in WV. They also told us there are 2 types that are even spelled different and she has the worst one. The one that progresses with few treatment options, or so we are told. They told us she could soon end up bed ridden, which I know can happen over time. I have yet to find 2 types in my research. Has anyone heard of this? Thanks for any help and info!######Hi, I have not heard of fibromyalgia being spelled two different ways, unless they are referring to fibrositis, the older version of the term that used to be used for the condition. Fibromyalgia means pain in the muscles and tendons. Fibrositis is not being used as much these days as it refers to inflammation of the muscles and tissues and tendons. There is primary fibromyalgia which means it is a continuing and progressive condition with no cure or etology (reason for the condition.) (The one that ususally progresses, gets worse as time goes by.) Secondary fibromyalgia can be a condition that was caused by a trauma, usually some type of accident or from some other health condition. Occasionally this condition might go away over time, with proper treatment, or at least go into remission. I think some of us can have primary and secondary fibromyalgia and by that I mean if it started out as primary, the general aches and pains and poor sleep quality, and if there is other problems with the musculature and skeletal body such as spinal spurs, bulging discs, degenerative disk disease or some other conditions it can be referred to as a secondary problem. So, in my case I have both and as the rest of my problems progress so will the ``fibromyalgia. '' It usually is n't fibromyalgia by itself that will cause a person to become completely disabled, it can be other health and bodily problems that aggrivate the symptoms. Some doctor's give the name fibromyalgia to a condition that acts like fibro because they have not found the true cause. Many people can have a hidden problem that will resemble fibromyalgia. If the reason is found and treated sometimes it can get better for some people. Fibromyalgia is not a simple condition, but the term is used frequently to put a name to an existing condition that fits the general critera of the existing symptoms. Hope I have n't made this more confusing for you. MistyMisty######No, you havent made it more confusing. I understand what your saying. Thank you for taking the time to reply this helps alot. There are lots of web sites on the subject but sometimes you get better info straight from the source, meaning someone (being you) who has the illness and has experience with it first hand.

Can people get optic neuritis with the MS issue? What makes a neuro say MS with just ON. Just curious.######Optic nueritis is very common with MS, if you 've had a couple of bouts within a couple of months it 's probably MS, but there are other things it could be. MRI's should be a necessity before making a dx. If your Nuero has n't sent you for any tell him you want a brain and spinal MRI with and without contrast. That along with the optic nueritis should be enough to tell your doctor for sure. That 's exactly how I was dx. I had the first bout of optic neuritis at about 23. Unfortunately I had group health at the time and they did n't say a word about it, next time it happened I had regular health insurance and was immediately sent to a neuro and was given a brain MRI, It did n't show anything, so I had another bout a few months later and they did another MRI, brain and spine this time, and my spine was caked with lesions. This is n't the normal thing as most peoples lesions are seen in the brain before the spine, but not with me (I 'm just not normal, lol) Now my brain has caught up, but that 's life with this...

Lately I have been feeling really lost and the more I learn about MS the more it seems to explain some of the things I have been dealing with all my life. I have always had sharp head pains that come and go, which I think are related to the lesions. I get a frequent numbing feeling in my legs that I always thought was normal before. But the part that scares me most is that I feel like my memory is getting worse- it 's something my friends and coworkers have noticed. I consider myself to be a smart girl, was lucky enough to graduate from an Ivy League school and have worked hard to get where I am in my career, so the possibility that I come off as lost or dumb is really upsetting to me. For others dealing with MS, do you suggest any coping strategies for memory loss? I imagine some of my symptoms are normal and I am just dramatizing now that I seem to have a reason for them. I do feel like I need to work twice as hard to process and remember things lately, though, and i do n't know if that 's because of the illness or because I 'm so stressed out about it that I 'm letting it affect my health..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Multiple Sclerosis

I am new here. I have not yet been diagnosed with MS, though it 's something I 've suspected for years. Right now I 'm diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I 've never had any MRI's done of my brain or spine to dx MS. I had optic neuritis about 18 years ago when I was 14 or 15. I 've read that 55% of those that have optic neuritis will go on to develop MS. So here is my question, who has had optic neuritis? Did you get it before or after your MS diagnosis? Thanks in advance for your replies.######I have had optic neuritis. I had it in March of 2003, and was diagnosed with MS in December of 2003. My ophthalmologist wanted to do an MRI when I had the optic neuritis, but until then I had never heard any mention of MS. So I told him that he was crazy, and I did n't have MS. The O.N. cleared up on its own, and I let it go. But then about 6 months later I developed numbness in my mouth, on the same side of my face that I had the optic neuritis on. Something smelled fishy to me. So I called my internist, as well as my immunologist. Both said to see a neurologist. I did, and while he thought that I was perfectly fine from his physical exam (yeah, right. I ca n't walk in a straight line, but I 'm just fine.) he sent me for an MRI of the brain. It showed several lesions. I went to see an MS specialist, and in January of this year I had a spinal tap and the diagnosis was confirmed. So, I did n't have a positive diagnosis of MS when I had the optic neuritis, but that 's only because of my own stupidity and me refusing to have an MRI. I guess I just did n't want to believe it could happen to me. But even though I did n't have a positive diagnosis when I had the O.N., looking back on all of m y ``klutziness '' and other physical symptoms over the years, I have probably had MS for a long time, long before the Optic Neuritis. That 's just what led me to eventually seek a diagnosis.######I do n't know if it was it was diagoxed as optic neuritis, but my first sympton was blurred vision. I went to an eye doctor who gave me a prescription for glasses, which i never filled. About 1 year later my legs became numb like novacane and stayed that way. An MRI showed MS. That was 22 years ago. It is relapsing remitting, but slowly progressing the last five years.######Hello Redwing... I had ON... in 2002... I have posted my experience on here under optic neuritis... But in short... i was having Dbl vision and went to ER. . and got an emeregency MRI. . nothing seen... was admited over night... sent home said i was stessed... and thats what it was from. . but they did say the MRI was for suspicious of MS.. Then vision was dark and gray and color was freaky and was put on Solumedrol for 7 days IV... Vision shorta came back slowly... now there is obvious demage of the nerve and still effect of that. . dim color when entering dark place. . and depth off. Now... 2yrs later... L'hermettes Sign... GP sending me back to a neuro again. . July 29. I have had no dx. I do have all my documents from my old neuro... he sadly left. But i do have all the test rests and his notes. Hope this helps in some way... ttyl Chinacat######It 's interesting that you asked that question. I made a different post, but my mom was diagnosed with MS about 2 months ago. It came as a real shock. She just woke up one morning and coudl n't walk. All her mobility functions were not working. After being in the hosiptal for 4 days and running all kinds of tests, they determined that she had MS. This actually was her second episode. Her first episode happened over 20 years ago, when she had optic neuritis. The doctor's did n't even think of that until after the fact... so to answer your question, my mom had optic neuritis before she was diagnosed with MS, but the optic neuritis was actually her first episode. I hope that helps... and i hope that you find the answers you 're looking for. Good luck and take care. Love kitten######Redwing, I 've heard of many people who had eye problems, went to the opthamologist and he made them go for an MRI which determined the MS. Apparently it can be seen when its ON easily. But, of course, all cases differ!######Hey Redwing! You may or may not be familiar with the MS story of Montel Williams, the famous talk show host. One of his earliest symptom was the eye problem, which resolved so no further investigation was done. Because of his work-outs on weights, the complaints with regards to leg and feet pain were attributed to the active lifestyle. It was approximately 20 years later that he was dx 'd with MS. He went in for treatment of severe leg and foot pain..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

I 've heard some neurologists have been treating the MRI as a tell-all for MS, dismissing MS in cases where the MRI does not show plaques. I 'm no neurologist but this does n't seem right, some patients with MS do not image well on an MRI. Some of the people on this board were finally diagnosed with MS despite initial MRIs being negative. Generally without a strong MRI result it is a lot harder to diagnose MS. Even a strong MRI with good clinical history must be backed up with other tests to eliminate the MS imitating conditions. However it is an extremely powerful tool for establishing risk factors and likelihood of an MS diagnosis.

Visited my regular eye doctor and he showed me a picture of the inside of my eye. Very scary indeed. He sent me to a specialist who refered me to another doctor who is a neurologist. Tests were done and the black spot was diagnosed as optic neuritis. At the time I had taken time off from my electrical job and was without insurance. The neurologist advised me to go back to work as he said that optic neuritis is sometimes the predecessor to multiple sclerosis and if I did get MS I would def need the insurance for the meds I would need. Has anyone here had optic neuritis and how long did it take your eye vision to get clearer? Mine has improved slightly but it still looks like I 'm trying to see thru a screen. Has anyone had MS after optic neuritis?######Please have a look at my thread `Papilloedema + macular oedema '. My condition was first diagnosed as optic neuritis, then as optic neuropathy and only after an MRI and fluorescein angiopathy was it determined that the optic nerve was not involved. It is true that optic neuritis is an early sign of MS but not everyone who gets optic neuritis goes on to develop MS. Anyway, as my case shows, until you have more detailed tests, you ca n't even be sure that it is optic neuritis. I hope you get your insurance situation sorted out because you really need to get your condition diagnosed asap.############Hi there Wirewoman- not sure if you will get this b/c it has been a while since you posted.

Had IV steriods followed by prednisone. A week after my eye went wacky, I developed weakness through out my whole body and my right side is weaker than my left. I was dropping things, tripping, I could n't walk very well. I was shuffling my feet, my arms and legs felt very heavy, I was tired all the time (was napping at least twice a day). I had tingling in my feet and hands which comes and goes. And my muscles tend to be jerky when I used them. I had an MRI, that was negative. An EMG, that was negative. Blood work, which was normal. Today, after two months, I still have these symptoms but they have gotten somewhat better. My doctor is kind of looking at MS but said he wo n't diagnose unless I have another attack. My question is do lesions have to be present in the very early stage of MS? If so, why does it take so long for people to get diagnosed if it is as easy as an MRI?######MRI may not show any brain lesion during the first attack even if there is MS. One attack is not enough to assume MS. At least 2 episodes of neurological symptoms are needed to assume MS. Further tests are requested to diagnose MS: examination of the cerebro-spinal liquor (lumbar punition) and evoked sensory potentials.

I thought he was getting at the fact that I did have ON before, but I said yes, but last time I did this test it was normal. He replied, yes, well actually it was borderline. So I was bit mad that I did n't know that. So he wants me to go to a Neuro-Otologist to figure out the dizziness and go back to see him in Aug.. I had volunteered to do a LP becuz I just want to know what is wrong with me already... it has been since ' 93. So, just wondering if anyone else has had this experience? Could this mean I have anything else other than MS? (I know I would still need 1 more pc of clinical proof) Thanks######You can have optical neuritis and not have MS.. . I would go see a good NeuroOpahthamologist to begin with. . someone who specializes in the nerves and diseases of the eye. . and otologist is a hearing type doctor, who specializes in the ear, nose and throat... if you are borderline MS and are looking for answers, this doctor wont be able to dx you... a NeuroOpthamologist on the other hand dx's MS regularly based on inflamation of the optic nerve. Keeping in mind, that MS is a disease which can affect the brain, spine and eyes... (central nervous system). Good luck. Nikki######ON is the main symptom of MS among the majority of Japanese MS patients. Could it be MS, it would appear that more ``looky-loo 's '' are needed. As you have had ON since 93, if you had MS I would think that your MRI would show lesions or scars from old lesions. Your neurologist has given you some good advice. Follow the advice carefully. My VEP raised the alarm for my Neuro to order a follow-up MRI. At the time I had one MRI, but there were no active lesions. The second MRI was expanded to the cervical and thoracic spine where fresh lesions were found.######Thank-you so much for some answers. I had ON in 1993, but I was a child and what I have read is that pediatric MS presents differently than Adult onset. My book says that kids start out with a lot of sensory symptoms and very mild so it is harder to diagnose and takes years + years to catch it. My family Dr does n't want to send me to a Neuro-opthamologist right now. She wants the Vertigo + tinnitus sorted out first. So I am going to see my optomotrist and maybe an opthamologist again in the mean time. Just hanging in here! Thanks for reading######First of all, not to be rude, but have you considered seeing a different family practice doctor? One who wont send you to a specialist is not usually the one you want to be seeing for this sort of thing. You need someone who will work with you. Forget the optomotrist- he is useless to you and not a medical doctor. Go straight to the opthamologist. Ask him to look at your Optical Nerve and see if there is any inflamation... if there is, ask for a referral to a Neuro-Opthamologist as soon as possible. They can take months to get into see and your eyes arent something you want to play with, or wait on! Your family doctor is obviously gambling with your health not telling you to do this immediately. Pediatric MS does not always include sensory symtoms, it can come on exactly like adult MS. In my MS groups, we have 3 kids under the age of 16 who were dx... your book- might not be up to date. Thats the thing about MS, each month they make new discoveries about MS and symtoms/ treatment of symtoms and drugs which are either being released, or in the testing stages. Books, are usually not a good source of info, unless they are really recently published. . the internet, too- can be a bad source of info for the same reasons... some of (most of) what is published on the net is over 2 years old and virtually useless. Your ON in 93, could have been the first sign of MS.. . if it really was ON, its probably still showing signs of having occured. Its not unusual for the eye to fix itself, but the scarring is usually still there... a good doctor can see it. An optomotrist doesnt have the ability, he cant see behind your eye- nor is he medically trained to do so. Good luck to you. . Nikki######Hi, popstarrdiva. I 'm not negating the possible importance of seeing a Neuro-Otologist but I would also strongly suggest you seeing an Ophthalmolgist rather than an Optometrist and that it would be MOST preferable to see a Neuro-Ophthalmologist. And preferably a Neuro-Op who has the an OCT machine (Optical Coherence Tomography). Taking this type of picture of the eye can be helpful in determining what 's going on and at the very least, provides a good baseline. It 's hoped that as OCT technology progresses that it can actually be some sort of predictor in disease progression-- some believe that it is now but my Neuro-Op's opinion is that it has a ways to go. It 's also possible that a Neuro-Op might order an MRI of the optic nerve. Regarding Optic Neuritis, it is suspicious for MS. There other things that can cause it but if you research the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trials (ONTT) you will see that the statistic of those who have had ON going on to get MS down the line is quite high. I was dxed almost 2 years ago during a bout of ON (dxed by visual field testing, examination and MRI of the optics) and a brain MRI that showed lesions. I had unexplained and untreatable vertigo many years ago but it only lasted intermittently, over a period of about 18 months. There 's no way of proving the vertigo from years ago was MS related but my MS specialist thinks that it was and that I 've had MS for years without knowing it. What you said about sensory sx and children can be true for adults as well! Good luck to you and please keep us posted..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

Thanks######There are several conditions that can mimic skin cancer. These conditions are benign lesions and are much more common than skin cancers. A fibrous papule, flesh colored papule that usually appears on or around the nose, but can be found on other parts of the face, too, can mimic basal cell carcinoma. Seborrheic keratosis is very common growth, related to age (appears after 30's) and can be confused with moles. This lesion can change color, size, shape very quickly and thats why mimic melanoma (the most malignant skin cancer). Solar lentigoes or sun spots, also mimic melanoma and they are found on the most sun exposed areas of the body. Moles and skin tags can mimic skin cancer, too. Also, a differential problem can be caused by some skin infections, granuloms and ulcers. Hope I helped!.######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

I will go back next week to have the stitches removed and wondering what should I do to verify it has not spread into the blood system. If nothing is found around the tissue that was removed should I still have a scan and blood work? Also, what are the chances of the melanoma coming back? Thanks, Barry######According to survival rates you were told, I guess you are having an early stage of melanoma. Lymph nodes biopsy of the regional lymph nodes is usually performed to check for local metastases. You should ask to get checked for melanoma metastasis, cause there are cases when thin melanoma has spread distantly. You dermatologist is probably familiar with serological, immunohystochemical and histological prognostic markers. The annual risk of recurrence for tumors < 1.5 mm thick remains < 6% for the first five years dropping to under 1% for the next five years.######I have an appt next week to go back to have follow-up and just talked to nurse. She says that the tissue around the melanoma was free from any cancer and I also asked about the depth and stage etc.. She said it was superficial and lever 3 and the size was 0.51.

Types of skin cancer there are three types of skin cancers: basal cell skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer and the dangerous malignant melanoma. Since skin cancer is very closely associated to skin pigmentation, the fair skinned people are more at risk of developing skin cancer as compared to the dark skinned ones. The cause of skin cancer prolonged contact with direct sunlight is what causes skin cancer. The main culprit in the direct rays of sunlight is the uv radiation (i.E. Ultra violet rays). Thus most of the preventive action against skin cancer is concentrated on avoidance of uv rays. Protection against skin cancer protection against skin cancer is probably easier than the protection against other types of skin cancer. Still, a number of people ignore it and become target of this dreaded disease. Here is a list of things that can protect you from skin cancer: 1. Clothing: since skin cancer is caused by prolonged contact of uv rays with your skin, the more you cover your skin with clothing, the lesser is your risk of developing skin cancer. Full sleeved clothes, long skirts and trousers, big hats/caps, high necks etc are all helpful in preventing skin cancer. 2. Sun screen lotion: there are a number of skin care products available in markets that offer effective protection against skin cancer. Sun screen lotions and creams that have a spf (sun protection factor) of 15 or more are much recommended for use. 3. Avoid exposure to uv rays: this is the best protection against skin cancer. If you can time your outdoor activity during those periods when the uv rays are less intense, you are automatically protected against uv rays. Thus getting out either early in the mornings of later in the evenings is the best. 4. Diet: carotenoid fruits and vegetables are also known to help prevent skin cancer. Detection of skin cancer the various techniques for protection against skin cancer can only reduce your risk of contacting skin cancer. If you are really unlucky (or if you have not taken the protective measures against skin cancer), you might still get affected by skin cancer. In such a case, early detection can make the difference between curability and non-curability. Timely consultation with a qualified doctor, regular check-ups and accurate diagnosis can prevent skin cancer from becoming really dangerous for you.######Hi, do n't worry !!

I have chonic sinusitis and like most people I 've tried a lot of remedies and most dont work like they say. Thanks, Andy######Hello Andy, I have personally never used the sinus buster but my doctor did prescibe me something called sinus dynamics. It has worked incredibly and it so easy to use. Good luck with your search.######Yeah, I use Sinus Buster. Once I got used to the burn, it has become a godsend. I use two squirts in each nostril in the morning, and one squirt every 4-6 hours after that. It basically creates an irrigation system out of your own mucuous, and the result is astounding. I 'm experiencing allergy relief for the first time in my life. My problems had more to do with rhinitis than sinusitis.######I HAVE ALSO TRIED THIS PRODUCT WHEN I CAME BACK FROM THE ENT YESTERDAY AND GOT NOTHING BUT A SCHEDULE FOR A CT SCAN A WEEK AWAY AND FOLLOW UP WITH HIM 2 WEEKS AWAY... I HAD RUN ACROSS THIS FORUM MENTIONING THIS SPRAY AND FIGURED I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY... KNOWING I COULD NOT WAIT A WEEK TILL I FOUND OUT IF I HAD A SINUS INFECTION, I HAD TO AT LEAST TRY IT... I FEEL LIKE I WILL BE HEADING TOWARD NASAL SURGERY FOR DEVIATED SEPTUM... HOWEVER, THIS SPRAY HAS CLEARED UP MY BIGGEST SPOT OF BLOCKAGE, UP NEAR WHERE THE DEVIATION IS... ALSO, IT ALLOWED ME TO BE IN THE AC WITHOUT GETTING IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED... I WANT TO CONTINUE THE PRODUCT TILL I CAN SORT OUT THE ISSUE OF SURGERY... HOWEVER, I AM JUST WONDERING IF THE CONTENTS OF THIS SPRAY WILL DO LONG TERM DAMAGE TO SENSITIVE TISSUE? HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS RESULT WITH SINUS BUSTER? AND WHAT ABOUT LONG TERM USE?######I just ordered some today so i 'll let you know what the results are when i try it.######Well i 've been using it for several days and thh results are mixed. It does seem to offer some relief when i use it but it 'd made no difference to the sinusitis overall; that still gets worse on a daily basis. For what it cost plus shipping i would n't buy it again but might try sinol instead if anything. I 'm waiting for something called a saltpipe at the moment which is supposed to be amazing for all sorts of respiratory conditions so i 'll see if that has any impact on my symptoms. Watch this space.######I 've had sinus problems since I was a kid do, mostly, to allergies. Over the years I 've tried a number of different products with the last being cortisone-based sprays. After a year or so even they stopped working. About 5 years ago I began using Sinus Buster. At first the `burn ' was pretty rough. After I got used to it I found the results were excellent. Best of all, the product continues to work. It has n't lost its effectiveness over the years. My only gripe is that the product no longer comes in the original spray bottle- only the metered dose.######How long does the metered dose last? The spray i got is nearly gone in two weeks and that 's not eve nusing it all the time. I would be spending Â# 35 a month for saome mild relief and it 's just not worth it. I wonder if the metered dose would last longer. Of course the causes and what works are different for most people and if i 'd have had better results i would n't be complaining. Anyway the saltpipe has helped with the fatigue and breathing but had no effect on the sinusitis so far but i 've only been using it two days. I felt the benefit straight away with the fatigue and my breathing is gradually improving. One thing worth mentioning is that you can use saltpipes nasally as well for sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. At the very least it 's going to clean my lungs out and counteract the effects of pollution where i live (apparently it 's the second worst in the uk) and for that alone it was worth it.######departed, I too experience fatigue, could you describe yours? and how do you use a saltpipe? where is it found? thanks... dr's say fatigue is not a symptom of sinus issues... which makes it even harder to get treatment here############Use Sinol Nasal Spray, available at Rite Aid. It also ultizes capsaicin but is much easier to use. Website is very impressive and have many doctors and clinical trials behind them. I have been using it for 16 months and I am a new woman, love it !!######Capsaicin is the same stuff that is used in Pepper Spray, carried by Police and Military.######Steer clear of this product !!! Honestly, it is one of the most painful experiences to spray this in your nose. IT SEVERLY BURNS YOUR NASAL CAVITY !!! . Any benefit it provides (which is little in my opinion) is FAR outweighed by the extreme pain. No joke, it 's pepper spray up your nose. Dumb idea for a product.######I have n't used this stuff in years. The first time I took it, it was one of the most painful 5 seconds in my life. But then I got used to it. I had headaches all the time and this only provided temporary relief and it was getting expensive to use it everyday. I went through two bottles very quickly. I went to a chiropractor and he discovered that my neck and back was out of alignment and causing my headaches. After some treatment from the chiropractor, I never had to use sinus buster again! I would n't recommend sinus buster as a permanent, long-term solution to your sinus/headache problems. I would only recommend it for the occasional sinus/headache sufferer. There are more practical solutions out there and you ca n't be dependent on sinus buster for the rest of your life.######Sinus Buster just issued results from a rigorous clinical study run at a leading medical research facility. It apparently worked incredibly well agaist congestion and sinus pain. And completely safe. No rebound. Do not accept any knock off capcaicin products with similar sounding names like the one mentioed above. It is definitely not the same !!!######Thanks to everyone. I jotted down all your suggestions. My ent will not give me anything else. He said there is nothing else out there. He has written me a prescription for everything possible. Pills, sprays, etc.. Nothing works. I get 2 allergy shots each week, allergy pillow cases, cleaned my ductwork, got new carpet, nettie pot, all OTC medicines, saline sprays. I sleep in an upright position. I am excited to have maybe have found a solution.######JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN AS A LONG SUFFERING SINUSITIS CASE. I TRIED SINUS BUSTER... PAINFUL AND REALLY NO HELP. I EAT CAPSICAIN, DRINK IT BUT NOT OF ANY BIG HELP. I SEE OTHER CAPSICAIN SINUS FORMULAS SUCH AS DR. SCHULZE'S BUT HAVE N'T TRIED. I 'M SCHEDULED FOR FESS SURGERY AND HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING SO SEVERE. WISH THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE. SO MANY OTHER PRODUCTS OUT THERE. I KEEP TRYING THEM AND RESEARCHING. GOOD LUCK######I have just started using the Sinus Buster which I bought at Rite Aid for about$ 15. I have had chronic sinusitis for about 25 years and had surgery which was of no benefit. I dont know about long range effects but the sinus buster has helped me tremendously already. I breathe easier with little sinus congestion. I was having a lot of bloody mucous and no more of that so far either. I plan to continue using this. I can tolerate the short burning sensation in my nasal passages when I first use it because it doesnt last long and is so worth it!######Sinus buster did not help me. I even bought casicain oil and made my own spray... ouch! But still no relief. good luck. I 'm scheduled for surgery... uuugh######I ca n't believe this would be a good thing to put in your nose! I have chronic sinusitis-- the drainage feels like a lump in my throast. Most of my life. No allergies. Two yrs ago I had surgery to remove a cyst filling most of the maxilarry sinus, causing blockage and infection because things could n't drain.

I have nasal polyps and tested positive for mold and other environmental allergies and i have days when everything seems fine but I also have days that i feel like crap. Pressure and/or pain on the face (cheeks, nose and eyes), sometimes even tingling, maxillary sinus pain, upper teeth pain, ear fulness or sometimes pain etc and the doctors I saw said it 's sinus infection caused by allergies so take Allegra D or Zyrtec, use NAsonex, and everything should be ok. As I said, sometimes it is, but sometimes it 's not at all. I 've started seeing a naturopath doctor and I hope it 'll help a little bit, but I was wondering if any of you, the sinus pain sufferer, have any suggestion on what to do to improve my condition. I currently live in a city on the East Coast, with lots of humidity, but we 'll move shortly to Colorado, where the weather is dry and everybody says that this will help my sinus condition. Thanks.######Chronic sinusitis is usually a result of repeated antibiotics being used to treat sinuse congestion. If it is chronic you probably have a systemic candida infection and need to stop with the antibiotics and start with treating the systemic infection. I have had this for many years and finally think i have found the key to treating this thing created by my doctor way back in 1987.######I wo n't get into a detailed argument with the first responder to your post but would encourage you to be extremely wary of that non-scientific advice. The polyps may be the root cause of the infection not clearing. They can block the natural drainage passageways in your sinuses and cause infections to recur almost immediately. Has your doctor recommended anything to help shrink the polyps? Generally a short course of oral steroids followed by the use of a nasal steroid spray and Singulair are pretty effective at keeping polyps from recurring (unfortunately, there is no natural way to deal with polyps, they are difficult to treat and, if not addressed, can require surgery to remove them. Here 's a list: 1. Get a Neil Med Sinus Rinse bottle and irrigate your nasal passages 2-3 times a day. 2. Talk to your doctor about a steroid nasal spray to keep the inflammation at bay during allergy season. 3. Take an antihistamine daily during allergy season (and consider undergoing allergy testing). You really should look for an ENT or allergist who specializes in treating chronic sinusitis so you have someone who can help you manage this (if the ENT recommends surgery right away get a second opinion).######Scientific? I post nothing that is not verified medical fact.######When I lived in Colorado I had the worst sinus infection ever, caused by the dry air and dust. It was Colorado Springs in 1992. I do much better in a moist climate, but that 's just me. At least in Colorado there are good NDs to treat you.######I simply hope that people will take the time to actually verify those ``facts '' before they start thinking that antibiotics contribute to sinusitis. Bacterial sinus infections that are not properly treated with antibiotics can cause serious health problems.######I was given antibiotics and seldane only for my sinuse problems to return a short time later. I now have and have had chronic sinusitis for many years as a result of that witch doctor treatment and have now realized the source of the chronic sinusitis as well as the fact seldane was removed from the market as a dangerous drug. That 's what modern so called scientific medicine has done for me. I suspect you are in medicine and think you guys need to be ashamed of yourselves for what you do to people.######Your suspicions could n't be any more wrong. I have battled chronic sinusitis for 20 years but have had the good fortune to have been treated by 3 incredible doctors (2 ENTs and an allergist) who have helped me get my sinus issues under control. I wasted thousands of dollars on bogus natural treatments before I finally found a doctor who actually specialized in treating chronic sinusitis and I am incredible grateful to him (Dr. Donald Leopold at the University of Nebraska Medical Center) for helping treat and educate me about chronic sinusitis. I do n't want others who suffer from chronic sinusitis to spend the time and money chasing phony hope when there are real, scientifically proven, treatments out there. I certainly understand how people become frustrated because chronic sinusitis is a difficult disease to diagnose and treat, but blaming it on Seldane or antibiotics might just keep someone from getting the help they need to find lasting relief..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

Sometimes sinus infections wo n't clear no matter what antibiotics you take if there is a nasal polyp obstructing normal drainage. I once had a sinus infection for 8 weeks, (no antibiotic was helping) and finally a cat scan of my sinuses revealed a polyp. After the surgery to remove the polyp, the impacted infection could drain properly and I was back to normal. Check back with your doctor to find out why you still feel so lousy. zuzu xx######Sinusitis unfortunately is aggrevated alot by weather and other stuff to.

They put me on FLONASE nasal spray and honestly at first I was resistant, but I have had alot of success with it.

It really works! It took cleared my sinuses almost instantly. I recommend that people suffering from sinus problems whether it be congestion or sinus headaches, it WORKS!######Many persrictions out there to help you. I would inquire.######I know Sinus buster but I do not use it because it contains capsaicin (spiciness of hot red peppers) which irritates the nasal lining. Due to this irritation nasal tissues shrink and you get an open nose. But this relif is in exchange of health of your nasal membranes. I recommend you read Goce Aleksovski's answer to my related question here: http://ehealthforum.com/health/treating-si nusitis-t169629. html.

I used to get at least 1 per year. Well this one never went away. I have been experiencing complete swelling of my sinuses, sever post nasal drip, coughing up mucus, developed asthma as a result of that, nasal polyps. After going to several different docs, their final diagnosis was the polyps and deviated septum. I had surgery to repair that and remove the polyps. 4 weeks later the sympoms returned. Complete and total congestion. I can not breathe through my nose at all. Tests show I get staph infections in my nose, no allergies, have been on every allergy medicine, antibiotic and nasal inhaler known to mankind. Nothing works. My post nasal drip was so severe in february that I ended up with pneumonia. Docs are perplexed and have no idea what else to do for me. Prednisone is the only thing that completely clears me up and helps me feel semi normal again but you cant take that long term. It 's a catch 22. I either suffer the consequencs of long term prednisone or I get pneumonia and possbily die from it someday. Does anyone have any suggestions or other things to try?

You do not need to have nasty colored nasal drainage to have a sinus infection. You doctor can take a set of sinus x-rays to see what is going on. Sometimes long term antibiotic therapy is necessicary to take care of sinus problems. That fact that your eye swells and is bloodshot definately means that something is going on that needs a docs attention. Call your doc and get this all checked out..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

My doctor is getting me to treat it with nasal steroids, decongestant, steaming, saline spray and I 've cut dairy out of my diet. I am definitely seeing some improvement but it 's very slow, and made worse by vertigo from fluid in my ears- so I 'd really like to feel better soon! Most of my congestion is there in the morning time, so tonight I 'm trying a humidifier in the bedroom to see if that will help. A couple of weeks ago, when it was quite bad, my doctor gave me an antibiotic and it helped me feel better. But after I finished the course the problems came back after a few days. This may have been made worse by the fact that I also stopped the steaming & nasal sprays because I felt better. I went back to the doc and she said to try treating it again, and if in a few weeks I 'm still not getting better she 'll send me to an ENT. She also gave me another prescription for an antibiotic just in case I felt I needed it. She said that if I started getting facial pain again that would indicate the need to use it. So I have n't really had much pain, just a tense tight feeling in my forehead. But today I am getting vision changes in my right eye, not severe, it 's just a bit blurry. My teeth are also slightly sensitive on that side, but that could be down to jaw clenching as I 've noticed myself doing it a lot especially on that side. I do n't have any real pain, just a small sense of pressure in my forehead and eye. I can breathe freely due to steaming & nasal spray. I 'm just wondering if I should take that antibiotic- would the inflammation/congestion cause that slight change in vision or does it indicate that I need the antibiotic to get rid of a bacterial infection? I do n't want to take it unless absolutely necessary so am being very careful in my consideration! Can anyone offer advice?######Hi, and thanks for your query on eHealth forum! Some antibiotics cab cause a change in vision, so please consult your doctor immediately regarding this. Chronic sinusitis is often allergic and can be due to mold infection too. A damp wall in the house, carpets, and ACs are all potential sources of mold. Please consult an allergy specialist. You may need to take the allergy test. Chronic sinusitis can also be due to EBV infection. The other possibility is deviated nasal septum. Nasal polyps and tumors, worms in stool causing high eosinophil counts, gastric reflux are the other causes. The treatment will be complete only on removing the cause. Hence please consult an ENT specialist (you must already be under one) and discuss these possibilities. Depending on the cause treatment will be prescribed. As of now you are only being treated symptomatically. Hope this helps. Take care!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Sinusitis

They said it was nothing to be concered about. I never asked them what my blood preesure was. Today, I went to the doctor and my blood pressure was 96/68. She said it was alittle low but nothing to worry about. I 'm 39 years old. My parents both have high blood pressure and are on medication for it. What is considered low and borderline low blood pressure? Is 96/68 low?######Doctors today would like to see most people sustaining a BP of 120/80 or below. However there are many variables depending on the individual and their overall general health. 96/68 is low but not all that unusual and can occur in perfectly healthy people. Anything at or below 90/60 would warrent further investigation, especially since these #s would most probably cause some symptoms in most people. If you are not experiencing any symptoms such as lightheadedness, dizziness or fainting, and your doctor had checked you out and is n't concerned, then you should n't be either. zuzu xx.######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

But something I 've been noticing more and more often lately is that almost every single time I stand up from a seated or lying position, I get super dizzy and the feeling I 'm going to faint. I have never actually fainted in my life and usually the feeling goes away when I stop walking, stand there for a few seconds and I 'm good to go. But it 's frustrating going through this all the time, and I may end up fainting in the future, who knows. Sometimes just the simple act of picking up something off the ground makes me feel lightheaded. Is this normal? some websites say it 's normal for people with low BP to have these symptoms. Other websites say people who have naturally low BP do not show any symptoms and this only happens to people who have higher BPs that drop suddenly. But I 've always had low BP. I experienced greyout once about 5 years ago (saw everything in black and white only), had to lay down. What do you think? should I be worried or do you all have these problems as well?######Feeling dizzy is associated with low BP so it 's quite normal. Possible when you feel dizzy it 's just a touch lower even more than your normal (low) BP. Personally I would n't seek medication to increase your BP unless you started feeling like this all the time or started fainting. I wish I had low BP!######Eat more protein and eat more often, smaller portion this should raise your BP..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

It is agreed though that any reading below 90/60- 90/50 can be considered low. If there are no symptoms, chronically low blood pressure is fine and nothing to worry about. What is normal for some people may be too low for others. Sudden falls in blood pressure can be dangerous, because they can cause dizziness or unexpected fainting. There are many causes. A number of medications can also cause them, such as the beta blockers and diuretics. The drops in blood pressure can be made much worse by alcohol consumption or the use of certain other medications. Big plunges in blood pressure can be life-threatening. If you get frequent dips in blood pressure, ask your doctor to review & adjust your medication. If your blood pressure is consistently at the same level (within reason) and you feel fine- everything is OK. flowergirl.######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Is 95/54 too low?.######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure######My blood pressure was low to begin with, and now it is getting lower. I take my own, at least 2 x a day, because of a new medication I am on. In the past few weeks my BP has gone from a normal (for me) of 100/80 or 110/60 range to and average of 95/54. Is that to low?######Hi Robin, What 's considered low blood pressure for you may be normal for someone else and vice versa but most docs would tell you that your #s of 95/54 would fall into the low blood pressure range. Since this is a new low for you I can understand you questioning it. Rule of thumb is that unless it is causing noticeable symptoms like faintness, dizziness, tiredness, lethargy etc it would not necessarily be called '' low '' and is not normally considered worrisome. Some experts define low blood pressure as readings lower than 90 systolic (yours is 95) or 60 diastolic (yours being 54) you need to have only one number in the low range for your blood pressure to be considered ``lower than normal ''. Note I did n't say ``too low ''. There 's a difference. SO. Since your diastolic is a few points below 60 then yes, your blood pressure would be considered slightly low. If you feel fine, I would n't worry but given that you have quite a few other health issues going on, it could n't hurt to let your doc know that it 's much lower now on your new med. Perhaps you 're getting too much of of good thing! and your dosage needs to be smaller. zuzu######I see the doc tomorrow- thanks for the heads up!

He talks about the challenges of treating hypertension in people with CKD and hypertension in general. I find this article very interesting. Among other things, he says that the most common cause of resistant hypertension in people with normal kidney function is a failure to use adequate diuretics, or any at all. He also explains how taking medications at night affects dipping patterns and other related issues in dippers and non-dippers with CKD and describes hypertension treatment thresholds for various groups of patients, as well as how the treatment guidelines are starting to reflect the evidence from clinical trials and are being adjusted upward for certain patient groups. He says that hypertension and high blood pressure are not the same thing. Hypertension is a genetic disease where elevations in blood pressure occur at an early age, either brought about by renal or hormonal issues or not, while elevations in blood pressure that fluctuate are causes by a whole spectrum of events that occur over a day and does not necessarily equal hypertension. I have always thought that hypertension and high blood pressure meant the same thing, not realizing that there WAS a difference. flowergirl######To me High Blood Pressure is Hypertension is High Blood Pressure is Hypertension. Both terms still equate to a higher than healthy level of blood pressure in one's circulatory system. In most cases, the medical industry does n't know the exact causes of higher blood pressure, and the medical industry does n't know how to keep blood pressure down at healthy levels; but the medical industry know how to lower blood pressure, somewhat, thru medications that block or inhibit excessive, damaging hormones. To me, any doctor that blames high blood pressure on heredity or stress or anxiety or panic attacks is just a person who does not know the real reason for the unhealthy blood pressure, but still wants to maintain a professional image.######I agree with you. Those two terms are interchangeable. In my mind, they mean the same thing. However, it was interesting to see this referred to as '' '' `the old school of thought '' '' '' in a couple of texts. This is one definition of hypertension I found: 1. Arterial disease in which chronic high blood pressure is the primary symptom. 2. Abnormally elevated blood pressure. fg######As you posted, high blood pressure can come from arterial disease, in which the circulatory system is plugged up. It makes sense that, if there is a kink or plug in the pipes, the fluid inside the pipes will be under more pressure. The other thing that causes higher blood pressure, in almost all other cases, is the overproduction of body hormones that cause the pipes to constrict, or tighten, or narrow. The medical industry found out that Angiotensin I and II cause the blood vessels to constrict, tighten or narrow. So.... they made meds like Ace Inhibitors and ARBS and Beta Blockers in order to block, or inhibit the metabolism from making too much Angiotensin. The question, therefore, is why is someone's metabolism making too much Angiotensin? I have found four reasons for my metabolism to be making too much Angiotensin. When I read about high blood pressure caused by heredity, I say thanks for nothing! Even if true, the high blood pressure is still because the metabolism is producing too much Angiotensin! So... the proper approach to curing an individual's high blood pressure is to target that individual's metabolism, in order to make the metabolism as healthy as possible, IMHO..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

I 'm totally not the typical pancreatitis patient- female, thin, fit, good diet, minimal alcohol consumption, no visible gall bladder stones on ultrasound... I had the pancreatitis for 5 days before taking myself to hospital. In those 5 days I saw two different GPs. One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain. My husband died of Pancreatic Cancer 15 years ago. oh, and the depression is worse, of course. Wishing you luck Ann######Hang in there!######Oh gosh, Ann, that sounds terrible. I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment. Can that happen from acute pancreatitis or only chronic?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich, than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E.. When im with my friends. I 've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana? Well, heres to everybody whos had to go through this damn disease, life aint over yall: wink:######Hi, i just wanted to say- be careful! I first developed symptoms at 18, was diagnosed at 25 and i 'm now 32, and i 've had 25 attacks, three within the last three months. It sounds as is your attacks are really mild- you 'll know if you need to go to hospital- because the pain gets way too bad to cope with! I do n't think my ap is linked to alcohol either, but I have cut it out, just to be sure. If you have to drink, I tink you 're better off with `long ' drinks such as wine, beer, etc.. Do n't drink spirits! And, sorry to say, you 've got to stop smoking, completely. It sends all your risk levels through the roof, and you ca n't afford it. You are already at an increased risk of cancer of the pancreas- very deadly, so you have to minimise all the other risks! Above all, do n't mess with this illness. I 've had it for a long time; sometimes it leaves me alone for 18 months, other times it hits again and again, and just takes over. Every time you 're ill your pancreas gets damaged, and you need it to last you the rest of your life. When you see what ap can do to you, it gives you a new appreciation- it can get much, much worse, so play by the rules in order to keep yours as mild as possible for as long as possible. I know it 's boring- having ap when you 're young is a real pain, but treat it with respect! C######thats good advice my son was diagnosed at 16 he is now 23 and been in and out of hospital allot and once in icu whilst on holiday in turkey, he dont touch alcohol and he still gets flare ups its a very scary illness######If you want to ward off pancreatitis, you need to stop drinking completely and smoking also. I have had to deal with pancreatitis for many years now, but more so in the last nine months. I was on a feeding tube for four months, and did n't think I was going to live through the last two attacks. Believe me, you do n't want to do anything that is going to make pancreatitis a part of your life. The quality of my life is not very good at all at the moment, and I would n't wish this on anyone. I have never been a drinker, but I do n't see why you ca n't just order a ``virgin '' when out with your friends......############every time u drink ur amylase and lipase will increase if the food you cosume contains a lot of fat pain may increase.as for ur marijuna aftr consuption u feel hungery and consume more food which might cause pancreatitis.######Hello, drinking with pancreatitis is always a bad idea !! And yes it can be avoided even when out with friends. Become the regular designated driver !! The attacks of pain you have following every time you drink should tell you it is a bad idea... With each acute attack you have, you are one step closer to chronic pancreatitis. And believe me- you do not want to be chronic !! My first attack happened when I was 8 years old (now 48). I have been chronic for the last 6 years. It is life stealer !!! It do n't kill you but it will sometimes make you wish it did. It is disabling (i have not been able to work since 2001). The pain is 24/7 and no matter what you do it never goes away. Yet you also get attacks when the pain is unbearable. Additionally chronic pancreatitis leads to many other disorders- the worse of which is type 1 brittle diabetes- uncontrollable diabetes. This comes with all the side effects of diabetes. Malabsorption is another problem. You can literally starve to death, even though you are eating. It causes all kinds of vitamin and mineral inbalances with come with their own problems. Please think twice before you take another drink. Each drink puts you closer to being chronic... And there are many more problems associated with chronic pancreatitis that I am not listing here. Reeann############Hi all. I 've just had my first attack of Acute Pancreatitis. I was rushed to ER and they gave me morphine, put me on a drip, gave me loads of antibiotics and would n't let me eat. I must admit it was pretty scary- I went in to shock and very nearly died. So I 've just got out of hospital and I do n't know very much about what to do next. The doctors did n't give me any advice except to only eat light meals ?! I see that alcohol is bad- that 's ok can live without that! Can anyone give me any advice? Am I likely to get it again? Thank you... Emma######research and learn to eat, and be devoted to, a non fat diet. I did not say low fat, I said non fat. It is the most important thing and I do n't see it on these posts. Maybe people do n't know how to eat to live with this disease. Please google non fat diets. Work up some recipes you like and stick to them, and carry a tupperware container of these foods with you if you go out. NO ALCHOHOL whatsoever. Do n't even smell it. Put mustard on your sandwich, no cheese no mayo. No egg yolks, buy egg whites in a container and scramble. maybe a slice of non fat cheese on the top. No butter at all, not light butter, nothing of the sort. No birthday cake or pastries, have angel cake instead. Spend a year working on the non fat diet and you will adapt very quickly. Never go off it. this is the way you will live from now on. It takes attention but you will be able to live with it easily once you get the hang of it. Take yours with you, is my advice.############i had an episode of acute pancreatitis about 4 years back. It was intense pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the back.my glucose level was also slightly high. sinnce then i have stopped drinking completely. thereafter i never had any problems whatsoever.my glucose also is normal.but thereafter my calcium level is always low. now i am taking calcium supplements 3 times a day. the absorption is very poor. i also have to take vitamin d. can i now start drinking occasionaly.######My boyfriend has been hospitalized 4 times in the last year for pancreatitis but he continues to drink, now the doctor said this can kill him is that true? He does not seem to get it he thinks that they are just make things up can this kill him if he does not stop drinking ???######I 've had a very serious acute pancreatitis attack 3 days ago... the pain got worse throughout the day and at 1am in the morning I was n't able to take it anymore and asked my husband to bring me to the ER. I stayed in the ER for 6 hours, got an IV, they took my blood, urine samples, and did an ultrasound. It did not take them too long to figure out that I had acute pancreatitis, but they said they can not figure out why- I do n't really drink (maybe once in 4 months ??) and I do n't have gallstones- two of the most common causes for acute pancreatitis. I asked my mother if she had symptoms like that before or if it was in my family, and actually she said she had something like that before, similar pain, but back then they were not able to give her a correct diganosis (40 years ago). I am only 25, and had pain in my stomach before, however, I never took it seriously or it was never that bad that I had to go to the doctor or to the hospital. I have n't had any solid food in 3 days, I am scared to eat because of the pain. I am drinking lots of water and broth, but even decaf tea or chicken broth gives me pain, not too much, but I can tell that it takes time to get better. I got pain reliever like vicodin, which knock me out. I wonder if I can ever go back to my regular diet, I never really cared what I ate before, it was usually a very balanced diet, and sometimes it happened to be a bit fatty/oily. I will have a follow up appmt with my doctor next week and I 'll try to find out more if I have to adjust my diet from now on. Is it normal to feel pain when drinking broth/ tea after acute pancreatitis?######If drink was the cause of your acute pancreatitis, give it up, because when- and it will be when- you develop chronic pancreatitis, you 'll remember all those blase evenings of getting trashed with absolute regret, while being in total agony in the present and unable to think clearly about your fearsomely shortened future. Drink can be fun, until it is n't, and when it 's threatening your wellbeing, just give it up. Seriously. i ca n't put into words the extent to which you 'll rue the day you carry on.######hey guys.... . im 16 yrs old i have had two attacks of acute pancreatitis lol its acyually funny im sitting at mayo clinic now getting a bunch of tests done for this... i was first told i hace this two weeks before my 16 birthday and have since had to make a lot of lifestyle changes... i used to drink about 3 times a month with my buddys but havnt had a drop of alchahol since my first aattack... i also used to smoke cicgarettes (about a pack a day) but quit after my second attack... both times i was put on a low fat diet which is 50 grams of fat per day... for all who dont know that is about 5 tablespoons of mayonase !!!!! i was recently told i could continue a normal diet but have chosen not to... i guess i really dont want to take the risk of getting it again... for 1 it is way painfull... i dont know how many times i blacked out bc of it... and for two i am now repeating a semester of my sophmore yera bc i missed so much school and i just kind of gave up. . plus it really isnt worth the week in the hospital and not eating for three days.... if you ever want to know more or want to ask n e questions you can message me... ttyl guys....######i had ap to. almost died. multiple organ failure followed along with adult respitory distress syndrome. ap usually doesnt go this far but for me it did... my pancreas shot poison into my body. . making my lungs shut down... do i drink now? yes i do... just not as much... i do not expierence stomach pain when i do it though but am always watching for any sign of it, cause then id stop. Life goes on. Doctors will naturally tell you not to do it... but i dont worship that religion and a doctor is not a priest for me as it is for so many others. Listen to your inner most voice. . and it will tell you what you are allowed and what you are not. Pay attention to pain, it is there to warn you and tell you something is not right. I always had warning signs but unfortunately i did not listen to them... i thought drinking more would make the pain go away... and before you judge me... let me say this... im sick of encyclopidia people who believe everything they are told You have a disease... you must be aware of it, but you must live and be merry as well... be the designated drive... ha! some people arent that boring If i sound like a ahole... fine.... but im sick of hearing stupid advice that not based on fact the truth is they dont know where the limit it so they say dont do it at all... i say dont do it at all if you are too stupid to find your limit... but if not, find your limit and listen to your body...... and live and laugh... life is too short to go through it trying to prolong by erasing all the little pleasures... those who want the last years where u pee your bed and cant move... you go ahead and live healthy to die long.... i dont want to die long and im sick of your opra, self help answers######I am writting even though I it may be premature to do so. But I have been devasted by the news at the docs. I have had some discomfort in my right side abdomen just under the edge of my rib cage. I had an ultrasound done and the doc told me I have a cyst in my pancreas... now I am scheduled for a CT scan and I am freaking out of what it might be. The doctor has put a rush on it. . and this has made me even more nervous. I drink but mostly on weekdays, and usually have a beer daily... what is going on ??? I have had heart burn and bloating as well for some time, and many times loose stools. Guess I am looking for good news or something comforting... anyone know what is going on and should I worry ???######A Brief Journey of my pain In January 2010 I experienced my first symptoms of pain which turned out initially to be jaundice followed by a diagnosis of gallstones which meant an admission into hospital in early February 2010. After my first admission eating fatty foods was a key cause of the episodes of pain and was told by the consultant to have my gallbladder out 6 weeks ago but instead gave me 3 months to decide as I was not in a fit state of mind to decide whether I really wanted it so was expected to give him my decision on 13th July this year. I have continued to cut down on fatty foods and have lost almost 3 stones in weight since the beginning of the year, I am not grumbling about the weight loss however I would have preferred to do it differently avoiding pain attacks relating to food intake. I now eat substantially less and better variety of diet along with gentle exercise a few times a week, these pain occurrences have totally changed my life, clothes are loose and although I was t-total before now I will be for the indefinite future as I donâ$ t want food and alcohol relating to further pancreatitis so overall despite the discomfort in hospital I am much healthier and happier. Events superseded my decision to have my gallbladder out late July 2010 so in May this year was admitted again with gallstone induced pancreatitis which was extremely painful resulting a week or so later with my gallbladder removed. I was petrified of the operation but I had it done as I could not bear any more pain so I took the risk of general surgery via key hole. Waiting 8 hours in squelching UK heat was not pleasant especially when you are nil by mouth. On 29th June I was discharged from the consultant only to find a week later I was admitted with a further episode of an infection of the pancreas spending seven nights at the local hospital. Now I hope they have gone for good so when I see the consultant surgeon at the end of August I can try and be discharged for a second time. This time I had severe hiccups, excess sweating and lots of vomiting adding to jaundice, gallstone and acute pancreatitis, why do things in halves, all this when I donâ$ t drink, smoke, eat pretty healthily and have good health yet I have all of this unlucky or what.

Mark Crossley######hello all im 25 years old, i drank wine everyday for the past two years at least a bottle maybe two. i was jus released from the hospital today for pancreatitis. my levels were all off my pancreas was at 10,000 my potassium, and other electrolytes were low. i was in the hospital for 5 days the dr. told me i should not drink anymore as i could possible develop cronic pancreatitis. my question is did anyway experience a bloating around their abdomen or weight gain in that area after being released from the hospital? i was fed thru an iv and given pain pills so i cant understand what the reason would be for the weight gain. thanks in advance######Yes it is very normal to have bloating and gassy feeling when you are released from the hospital and it lasts for weeks until it is finally gone. Your stomach can look and feel huge! I am not sure about the weight gain except I know that the pain killers they give you cause you to be constipated and you need to be on stool softeners most times. I have been in the hospital 8 times with this and struggle to quit drinking but know if I do n't that I will develop chronic pancreatitis which will eventually kill me.######I just got out of the hospital today after four days in there. I was on the IV the whole time and I gained 10 pounds and my stomach is totally bloated still. I did not have any food till this morning, which was some of that hospital egg stuff. It did not hurt after eating it so my doc let me go home. The couple of doctors that I talked to said that I can go back to my regular diet (which consist of meat, dairy and junk, no fruits of vegies) as soon as I felt comfortable. They also told me to stop drinking for two weeks and then I can drink again. I do not drink every day and only have a couple of beers unless it is some sort of weekend away, then I can drink a lot.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago. I was in Tanzania when I got it and was rushed into hospital because the pain was unbearable. After 3 days there I flew back to England and remained in hospital for another 10 days. During my stay I had ultra sound scans, a CT scan, a cannular put in and over 25 blood tests. I wasnt allowed to eat or drink for 5 days. They said they thought it might be the malaria tablets I had been taking- doxycycline, but they couldnt confirm it and wrote down it was idiopathic on my discharge form. Ive been told I can try drinking again after 3 months but I 'm pretty terrified of it coming back- I cant handle that pain again! I think i will drink in the future if I can, just not binge drinking, which my doctor said should be fine.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago.

The first episode was in october 2002 (when I was 22), and the second only 8 weeks ago in june 2005. The first case was very severe as I did not know what was causing my abdominal pain, and the doctor I saw suggested I had a stomach virus that was circulating at the time. He gave me injections for the pain, but it continued into the next day and before long I began vomiting violently whenever drinking even small amounts of water. I was admitted to hospital once they discovered my amylase was up to 11,000, and was kept in over a week, the episode lasting 10 days in total. I had an ultrasound and an x-ray to search for gallstones, but none were found. I admit I used to be typical student and liked a drink, but never to constant excesses, and although I was honest with the consultant about how much I was drinking, they agreed it was nowhere near enough to cause pancreatitis, especially as I was only 22. I was advised to give up alcohol for 12 months â$ ``being young and stupid I only made it to 3 months, starting with the odd glass of wine, and I slowly resumed my normal alcohol consumption (around 20 units a week) without giving it too much thought. This continued until around a year ago, when I cut my drinking down by about half â$ ``I would have a few drinks during the week, and only have a big night out around once every couple of months. The second episode came 8 weeks ago, but I first thought the mild pain was due to a virus, as had suffered diaorrhea in the days leading up to it. I went to a & e to get my amylase checked as soon as the pain got worse and I knew what it was (you donâ$ t forget the pain of acute pancreatitis in a hurry!) . It came back as 4100, and again I was admitted. This time I was only in for 3 days, but was still in some pain when I was discharged. Again during my time in hospital I was given an ultrasound and x-ray but no cause was found. After this happened again I started to worry â$ ``my diet has never been unhealthy but I chose low fat options of everything and some organic where my budget would allow. I had no alcohol except one night out two weeks before my third episode, where I had around 10 units. I was called back for a ct scan 2 weeks later, but again nothing was found. The doctors were deciding what steps to take next, when I had the pain again. Then came the third time- I went straight to the hospital, and my amylase this time was only 1300. I was kept in for 5 days, during which yet another ultrasound and x-ray were done and nothing found and felt completely fine when discharged. I am now abstaining completely from alcohol, following a low fat, high carb (as suggested on other websites), completely organic diet, free from flavourings, colourings, preservatives and chemicals as far as possible, drink 3 litres of water, my only vice being 5 light slim cigarettes a day. I am tired a lot of the time, despite having at least 7 hours or more sleep a day. I am not, and have never been, on prescription drugs, and only take pain killers for headaches if absolutely necessary. Apart from the obvious, I am completely healthy. However I am medically overweight for my height, due to weight gained whilst on the contraceptive injection depo provera for a year and a half until april 2002, when I had a iud coil fitted. Plans are being made for an mri scan, but if nothing shows up I will probably be referred to a gastroenterologist for further tests. What I would like to know is, after 3 cases of acute pancreatitis before the age of 25: â$ cents am I likely to develop chronic pancreatitis or diabetes? â$ cents what tests should I request if they are not offered to me? â$ cents what other measures (apart from diet and alcohol avoidance) can I take to prevent this from recurring? I would really like to hear from anyone who has been in, or is in, a similar situation to myself, as every doctor and consultant I see is completely mystified and noone has a clue what is wrong with me. I just want my life back, without worrying about when I will be back in hospital next, and the horror stories about the results of regular attacks.######Hi! My daughter, 14, has been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Over the last 2 1/2 years she has undergone several test all within normal limits. Ultrasound- normal, ct scans, normal, and blood test, normal. However, she had hida scan performed of her gallbladder and this reveal dysfunction and had it removed (only part of the problem). She then underwent an ercp and this reveal sphincter of oddi dysfunction, very rare for children. Again, only part of the problem. The pancreas is the root of this evil. Do n't let them stop until you have an answer. If I had listened to the doctors, she would be the worst case of `nervous stomach/eating disorder ' known.######Hi, i was very interested to read your account- it sounds just like me, only I was 18 when it started. Like you, it took an age to get taken seriously, and they have now established that I have pancreas divisum (divided pancreas, you 're born with it, but it should n't be a cause on its own), no visible gallstones, no alcohol abuse (and you really have to work to get them to believe that when you 're in your 20s- they assume you 're out getting wasted every night!) . My situation now is that i 'm 32, and unfortunately I have continued to have about 2 attacks a year since 18. I am not diabetic, although there is a strong history of diabetes (1 and 2) in my family. I drink about two units a month, so barely anything, and I absolutely do n't think alcohol, or for that matter, food, have anything to do with triggering an attack. However, I do eat healthily, and exercise regularly. I 'd do this anyway- i 've always exercised, and never smoked (the one thing you must do is give up smoking- it 's got a host of links to damaging the pancereas, and our pancreases do n't need any excuse! It will also prove to the docs that you are doing everything you can). I live in the uk, and am about to go to liverpool to visit the research team there who specilaize in familial pancreatitis. One thing I have just come across this morning is a study at the bandolier site in the uk, which links selenium ace with possibly preventing further attacks. As I say, i 've only just seen this, but selenuim's a good thing to take anyway, and it 's worth a try! Let me know how you get on. It 's a tough disease, but the main things are getting the doctors to take you seriously and as the lady in the second message said, be pushy. It took them five years to diagnose my pancreatitis- and all it takes is a simple blood test. It will not go away on its own, so get in there and demand some attention! Good luck clare######Wow, that must be very hard having it twice a year- but at least you know what it is and can get straight to hospital so hopefully your enzymes do n't have a chance to get too high. Has it done permanent damage having so many attacks? Talk about doctors not understanding, my employers were also not happy as they thought oh she has pancreatitis it must mean she drinks loads hence its her fault she needs time off work! So now i 'm mostly self employed I run the risk of not being paid for a few days but at least I can avoid the constant pointless meetings about how much sick time I have had off and what I plan to do about it...! I did n't know smoking damaged pancreas that much, of course as if I need another reason to give up, I know it is no good whatsoever, but I have been good recently and a pack of 20 now easily lasts me over a week. Its a step in the right direction anyway! Yeah I have heard about the selenium thing a while ago, maybe studies were done in usa first, but its found in brazil nuts so if you like them its one less vitamin tablet to take! Pls let me know how you get on in liverpool. I have just been to hosp in croydon (possibly the worst in the uk!) to get my results of my recent mri scan, and when I walked into the room the ``doctor '' asked me why I was there !! Said I just want the results of scan, he asked if I was in pain, I said no I just want the results of scan, to which he asked if I would like him to examine me! By this point I was losing the will to live... He said he did n't have the test results, went out of the room for 10 minutes, came back and said they did n't find anything. How much I can believe him, I do n't know! Useless is not the word...######That 's what worries me most, really- every attack does some damage to the pancreases, so how much more attacks will it take before it packs up and we end up in a whole new world of pain? So, i 'm trying most things at the moment to stave off another attack. One thing which I have n't seen anyone discuss is when in the day their attacks come. Mine always, absolutely without fail, starts first thing in the morning. I either wake up with the pain, or it developed within an hour. I do n't know why this is- maybe it 's because the pancreas has been inactive over night and is starting to creak into action? I 'd be really interested in whether other people get it at the same time of day. What I want to avoid is it degenrating into constant, chronic pancreatitis. My mum is type 1 diabetic, so I do n't want to go there either! Also, we 'd like to have kids in the next couple of years- no desperate rush, but I think I need to start working out the risks. Pregnancy puts an extra load on the pancreas. I can find lots about people who havce had pancreatitis for the first time whilst pregnant, but have n't read anything yet on women with acute or chronic pancreatitis who 've been planning a family. Can anyone advise me? I 'm not expecting it to be an easy process, but at the moment I really do n't know what the chances and risks are. Hopefully the guys in liverpool may be able to help me with that as well. Clare######Yes thats what i 'm worried about two, I thought having 3 attacks was pushing my luck! 3 to you must seem great in comparison. My first two attacks started the same as yours, about an hour after waking up. With the third though I did n't get any pain until about 2pm, and was n't sure it was pancreatitis but took myself to hosp anyway due to history and amylase high at 1300 but lowest they had ever been. I do n't have any children so can not advise i 'm afraid. Hope you get some replies from women who can help with that, but out of interest how much extra stress does it put on the pancreas?######Yeah, it would really help to hear from some other people. There must be women out there who have had acute pancreatitis and wanted to have kids. I do n't really know much about this, which is one of the reasons why I want to get up to liverpool and get some info, but I know that it will be more complicated then usual. Apparantly one of the causes of ap is carrying (alhtough not necessarily having symptoms of) the cyctic fibrosis gene. One in 20 people in the uk carry the gene, so they 're going to test me for it, if I do have it, it 's really important that my husband gets tested as well, and if we both have it, that 's a whole new discussion. Apart from that, I just have n't had nine months without ap since I was 18, so the chances of me getting through a pregnancy unscathed are slim, I think, at the moment. As I understand it, all women are more at risk of getting ap when they are pregnant. I am assuming that that means that you and I are particularly at risk, and I have been told by one doctor that ap in pregnancy `usually ' results in miscarriage. But, that 's one doctors opion, and he was n't a specialist, so other dcotors may regard that as alarmist, or spot on. I do n't know. I could really do with some answers !! C######hey I read your posts and couldnt help but comment. . I had my first pancreatic attack when I was only 11 after that had 9 episodes in the time span of 2 years. After the two years I havent gotten any episode thank God, but to this date doctors havent found the cause. I went to Georgetown hospital, miami childrens hospital, Jackson Memorial, Baptist Hospital, John Hopkins hospital, Mayo Clinic in Rochester and tons of other hospitals and nobody could discover the cause. Now I am 20 years and havent suffered from a pancreatic attack, when i turned 19 I decided to try alcohol and since nothing happened i started to drink moderatly of course and rarely, my mom was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and i have decided to stop drinking so i wont end up in the same situation. We had tests done to test our genes and hereditary pancreatitis was not the cause apparently. I am registered as an unknown cause of pancreatitis but I think its hereditary that is the only explanation. Just wanted to let you all know######I had my first attack of acute pancreatitis one night when i went to bed. I didnt think anything of it and just went to sleep. the pain went on for another day and I thought I had pulled something and on the 3rd day of the attack the pain started moving to my back. so I went to the er and they did an ultrasound and a ct scan which all came back normal. when they got my results back from my blood panel my lipase was 10 times higher then it should be and so was my amylase. so I was in the hospital for 11 days and was sent home on pain meds and a low fat diet. The pain felt like it was going away and then 2 weeks later i started having the pain again but this time it was worse and I had started vomiting. so i went back to the er and the doctor said there wasnt anything they could do for me there and that he wanted me to go out of town to a different hospital where they could give me the right treatment. I was at the new hospital for 9 days and they didnt find any signs of gallstones and sent me home. I had a follow up with this new doctor and he did some lab test and my lip and amy was 5 times higher then what they should have been but lower then what they were when i had my attack and he gave me some pain killers and sent me home. I have 3 more attacks since the first 2 and this is all in a year. What do I do next since these doctors dont seem to want to help me get to the bottom of this..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

Spent a week in the hospital and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I was informed and told not to drink and being young and immature (24) I thought I could slip a beer or a drink in here and there which eventually led me back in the hospital for three days. Since then I stopped drinking for a while and one night at a graduation party had a few drinks which led to more drinks which led to pain but no hospital. I have now been sober since that day but I do have pain that comes here and there. When I went for a scan and bloodwork I saw my file and it said chronic pancreatitis. I am going to see a new doctor on the 21st. It seems like their is nothing much that can be done here but start eating better and NO DRINKING AT ALL. I only have my fathers insurance (which is a great insurance) until I am 26 which is 2 years from now. I really want to get the pancreas looked at to see how much damage I have done from drinking heavily since I was 19 years old. I was reading that I should maybe look into getting a contrast-enhanced pancreatic CT scan. Also what are thoughts on oxycodone and roxicet when you are diagnosed with pancreatitis? Sometimes I take these if I am in a little pain but read these might not be good for you if you have pancreatitis as well. What is the mortality rate from pancreatitis? How long do people normally live with this disease? Now that I have a little more informed I still get no definitive answers from doctors or gastros they all say the same thing which is eat healthy and do not drink. I still would like to know more. Thanks for any comments in advance. Brian######Okay I can only answer a few of your questions. I believe that pancreatitis is not cureable, it is manageable though, through diet and meds. As far as taking Oxycodone and Roxy's when your only in a little pain... thats way overdoing it. Heavy narcotics are dependance causing drugs if you take them for long periods of time. You also get used to them over time as your tolerance increases, so you have to take more and more to do the job. This is not a scenario you want to get into to control ``a little pain ''. These kinds of meds are meant for chronic conditions which cause major pain, we 're talking 8, 9, 10 on a scale of 1- 10, all day everyday. So you should really think about that. good luck, kat.######-Health Issues###-Pain Management

The doctors say it was idiopathic and then we found out that it runs in my Dad's family. Then, a year later, my brother also had an acute attack. Since then, I have felt just fine. When I left the hospital, I asked the doctor if there was damage to my pancreas. He said he did not think so. No referral really, and that was that. I felt better and got on with my life. I never really drank alcohol before the attack, and have NOT had ANY since. Over the last few years I have developed a major hypochondriacal state about my pancreas, even though I have felt fine. I have been to the ER 3 times when I had a little burping, panicking that my pancreatitis was back. All three times I was examined and had blood labs run, and nothing showed up. I was sent home and it went away. Lately, anytime I have a bit of a tummyache or anything I panick some more. Would I know if I had chronic pancreatitis since my pancreatitis the first time 4 years ago? I 'm terrified that something is wrong but I do n't know it because I feel good mostly all the time- and I read online that you can have CP but not even have symptoms! Would I have lost weight by now? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am trying to get in with a Gastoenterologist just so I can ask some questions and get some answers- they never referred me after my episode and for 4 years I have been so anxious, and reading the internet does n't help at all. I called to get in and my PCP acted like I was an idiot wanting to the see the Gasto without any symptoms since the first attack..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

Had what was thought of to be my first diverticulitis attack. At the same time, I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I had two issues going on at once. The CT scan at ER stated that I had inflammation on portion of descending colon. The results stated Ischemic colitis could be reason, but my gastro thinks it may be due to diverticulitis, as I do have diverticulosis. (and because at my age of 44, didnt think I was a candidate of ischemic colitis). The ER never addressed the inflammation. I then had gallbladder surgery and then pain in intestines and I was put on Cipro and flagyll. Im going on my 8th day of meds, and I feel so horrible and tired, and have bad diarrhea. But whats really bugging me is Im getting pain on left side under rib, where I believe inflammation was. Its a nagging pain. Never occurred before attack. Just curious as to how long it takes to heal if it 's truly diverticulitis. Im assuming if I had any dangerous problems, Id be bleeding and keeled over. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!######Hi, You say you had pancreatitis in November, have you had it checked out with the pain you 're having anymore. I am 72 years old and found out I had chronic pancreatitis when I was 68. I realize now I had my first attack of acute pancreatitis before I was 18 years old and several more acute attacks through the years. My ER trips I was told I had Gastritis. I was also told I had gallbladder disease when I was 22 years old but it was quite a number of years more before I had my gallbladder removed. When my gallbladder was removed I still remained having pain in my right side. I also would have full-blown stomachaches, usually most of the evening after dinner. My MD had upper GIs and all the tests he thought of done and could n't find anything wrong so he labeled me as having right sided diverticulitis. So for years this is what I thought was wrong with me and I just lived with it Then when I was 68 I woke up one morning with a stomach ache straight in the middle of my stomach, one bad enough I could n't hardly sit still I was rocking back and forth. I went to the emergency room and this time they diagnosed me with acute pancreatitis and said I needed to see a doctor and get my pancreas checked, as my brother had died with pancreatic cancer. I live close to John Hopkins so that is where I got a doctor and went and they went down and checked my pancreas to make sure I did n't have cancer and I was told I had a disease pancreas. So now what I have is chronic pancreatitis due to having so many pancreatic attacks not knowing what they were. You say your pain is on the left side and my pain was on the right side but your pancreas is really in the middle in the back of your stomach so it makes me wonder. I would not go as far to say I would guess you have pancreatitis, but one never knows I guess and since you have had it it would be wise for you to watch out and not get into much more trouble with that like I have. I am wondering if it can hurt on the right side, can it not hurt on the left side also. They told me I had to really cut down on fats and dairy products and since I have done so I have way less pain and I 'm doing much better. I really wish you well and hope to hear what your problems turn out to be. Seeing that you have had pancreatitis it really crossed my mind how many years I have spent trying to find out what was causing all of my pain and also wanting to warn you to be careful and watch your pancreas close so you would not be into chronic pancreatitis like I have. Much luck to you and I hope you recover and feel better soon. Shirley######Wow, you have had quite a journey !! What I initially felt on Nov 26 was cramps, thought I had to go to bathroom, but I thought my intestines would explode. God awful. Then I suffered through next 24 hours before I went into ER on my own. They found I had pancreatitis. I had soreness in that area, but not severe pain like in the intestines. Its strange, I had two things going on at once. I am curious about the thickened bowel area of the descending colon. My uncle is dying from colon cancer and while I am young, I still worry. This is all an enigma. I went to the ER with intestinal pain and dx with pancreatitis. Not sure if the two are connected. Dont think they are. I believe the pancreatitis is gone. But I am sore from under my rib cage down. Could be the tail, who knows. I know its not my gallbladder, cause it 's gone! Im sorry you suffered for so long. What do you do for your disease? best wishes!######Hi there, I certainly hope you are feeling some better by now, it 's pretty miserable when you suffer with stomach pain so long. I can well understand why you 're so concerned, that C word is always at the bottom of our thoughts. I have no idea what diverticulitis feels like as I never apparently really had it. What I have to do with this chronic pancreatitis is watch my diet eat very little meat and dairy products and that is really cut my pain down. I will tell you the pain that it can cause can make you rollup and roll and I really have n't had an attack like a real real attack, to end up in the ICU, as many of persons have. I have read some horror stories of people with chronic pancreatitis on the Internet and it tells me from what I have had I certainly hope to never get there. Not long after I found out I have this I almost headed to the emergency room one night I was pretty doubled up in pain but I managed to get over the worst and go to bed. I 'll tell you, you watch every bite you put in your mouth after you feel the pain it can. cause. I have considered myself quite lucky since I 've known I 've had it from what I hear and have read about other people. Of course chronic pancreatitis can turn into cancer also so that is something you have to watch out for. My brother died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 52 and he had never been sick for a day in his life until he got that.How we never know what will happen next and when we get stomachaches it 's so hard to guess what 's going on in there. Please keep in touch so we can all know what 's going on with you. I just pray that you get it resolved soon. Good luck! Shirley.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

I have had very high lipase and amylase levels for quite some time, without any symptoms. All the testing and scans has led my dr's nowhere. I crave sugar all the time, sometimes I have drastic energy crashes before I even know I 'm hungry. Recently my vision has gotten blurry, sometimes it is so hard to see that it gives me bad headaches. I know nothing about diabetes. Should I be tested? Thank you for your help.######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or ther other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. Curious. Rose######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or the other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. If you want to rule out diabetes, your doc should help you discover what is going on with you. Hope you can resolve this. Keep us posted. Rose######One doctor immediately said chronic pancreatitis, since my levels have been so high but have rollercoastered over the past couple years. But they ca n't find a cause or a cure for it. All catscans and MRI's have shown everything to be normanl, no blockages, stones, or inflammation.######Pancreatitis and diabetes can be related. If you have chronic pancreatitis, your pancreas is apparently comprimised and not functioning at it optimum level. Have you been referred to an endochronologist? When I was in hospital and not able to have anything by mouth for 10 days, on day 6, they introduced I.V. nutrition. This I.V. bag of `food ' was mostly sugar, with electrolytes and other vital supplements. I have not previously been diagnosed a diabetic, although I was borderline gestational diabetic with my first child and not with the second. The I.V. food bag, caused my blood sugars to be all over the place. I had insulin shots every day- multiple times a day- while the food bag was on the I.V. pole. They kept increasing the insulin in the I.V. food bag, but still needed to give me the shots- my body just was too busy trying to heal the pancreas to regulate blood sugars too. I believe that my insulin levels are not right yet and it has been a month that I 've been out of the hospital now. I need to see my doc/intern and get blood sugars checked as well. Just saw the gastro doc and still have a couple issues from that hospitilization episode yet to take care. I would make sure the pancreas is able to produce the insulin you need- You need to be proactive about it. Keep us posted Rose######I am not a medical professional but I do know from experience that yes diabetes and pancreatitis can be related. I have type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with chronic pancreatitis. They dont know if I was born with the chronic pancreatitis yet but looking back on my life long medical history it looks like I may have been. This is likely to be the reason why I am a double diabetic. So far lots of places I have read about online say that both chronic and acute pancreatits can lead to diabetes.######Thank you for all of the responses everyone. I have never been able to get a doctor to send me to an endocronologist, nor could I get one to accept me, because my blood sugar is always normal. My amylase and lipase are always a mess, but I ca n't seem to find anyone who wants to do anything other than take out my gallbladder. =-LRB- I 've given up for now..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Please help!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes######For the past few months my hubby has not been himself. He is tired all the time, and since mid December has been constantly thirsty. He ca n't get enough to drink. Several trips throughout the day to the bathroom, (but would n't that be from all the liquids he drinks?) His vision goes blurry, he gets very shakey, and sometimes he says he feels like he is going to pass out. No energy. While shopping last night I picked up a blood glucose test meter. We waited until this morning to do the test. He did n't have anything to eat or drink for 9 hours so we could get the proper results. The meter came up with ``510 ''. The test said if it is below 20 or higher then 600 a warning would appear letting him know it was too low or too high. We do n't know what a normal level should be. The test does n't really tell us. We did the test again about an hour after he ate lunch and it was ``471 ''. I did the test also to see what would happen and mine said ``80 '' in the morning and ``105 '' after lunch. He is 54 years old and NEVER been to a family Dr. because of not having any health insurance.Today I called all over to find a Dr. that will accept new patients without insurance. After 3 hrs. I found one who made an appt. but not until March 25. I even explained how worried I am about him. No one seemed to care. If he would of had insurance, they would have glady seen him. Can someone please tell us what a normal reading should be and your opinions on his symptoms? Thank you!######I do n't mean to scare you. But I would STRONGLY suggest you take your husband to a hospital emmergency room IMMEDIATELY. A lot of his other blood chemistries could also be out of whack and life threatening. It is possible that he may just get sent home with a prescription for glyburide, but please, you are better safe than sorry. These numbers are life threatening from what I understand. Please do not wait for the dr's appt. Go to the hospital. His numbers are extremely high. Anything above 126 is abnormal and these are life threatening values, again, from what I understand.######Normal is more in the range you saw on yourself, a bit higher would also be normal. In terms of symptoms, frequent urination is a symptom. I am not a Dr but my understanding is that where your blood sugar is too high, your kidneys try to dump some of the sugar out through urine. So you pee a lot. This dehydrates you and you are thirsty. I do n't know if you measured properly but if so, 510 and 471 would be very high. Can you continue looking for another doctor sooner? Is there not another medical service you can get help with?######I agree with Uma... your husband should go to the nearest emergency room. With blood sugars running that high, he could be in diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. While there, ask if he would qualify for uncompensated care (most hospitals have a fund to help take care of people who do n't have health insurance and are in financial straits but still need urgent medical care.) A non-diabetic's blood sugars would never go that high, even after eating a high-carb meal. Normal range is between 70 and 140, never higher. Your husband is definitely diabetic... question is, whether it 's type 1 or type 2, and the only way to tell is through some blood tests. Ruth######Yes, that would indicate diabetes, probably type 2, given his age, meaning he has resistance to his own insulin. He needs to see a doctor or go to the hospital asap to get his blood glucose in control. Normal blood glucose is between 70 and 120, so 520 is very high. Meters read ``HI '' when over 600, but that warning is just indicating extremely severe highs. Good luck, and do not let this slide so as to prevent any complications.######Finally talked hubby into going to the ER instead of waiting for Dr. appt. He does have type 2 diabetes. He did n't have any ketones which they said was a good thing. His glucose level while we were there was 296. They gave him a prescription for Metaformin. They set him up with a follow-up Dr. for this Thursday. I just want to thank e `one for telling me he should go to the ER. I was really scared for him. He 's been on the med. for 2 days but his numbers are still in the 200's. Anyone have any idea how long this med. takes to start working? Thank you all again!######Everyone is different but met can take weeks to kick in full effect. If I remember well they said as much as 4 to 6 weeks. When I started it was n't doing anything and I read it COULD take several weeks. It will slowly start to make a difference. Was it his morning levels that were so bad or after eating? In the mean time, go easy on the carbs and drink lots of water.######Not really sure if he is overweight, but probably is. . He is 6 ' 1 '' and weighs 255 pounds He 's gained 25 pounds since Sept' 07. Thats when he quit smoking (cold turkey) and took up eating candy. . tons of it! Around Nov./ Dec. is when he started feeling really bad. . (But since not feeling well he 's been losing weight) The ER did n't give us a diet plan or anything to follow before his Dr. appt. on Thursday, so I had to go online and look it up. I know the med. is making him even more sicker to his stomach, cramps, and diarrhea. I guess thats a normal side effect from what I have read about it and just to stick with it because you will feel worse before you get better ??? His reading this morning before breakfast was 189, the lowest it 's been since we started monitoring it a few days ago. Exercise. . yes, my hubby wants the both of us to start going for walks. We will ask the Dr. about it first. He 's a bricklayer and ca n't wait for spring to settle in so he can return to work. But mostly, all he keeps saying is. . ``I hope I get better ''. He 's very worried about not having insurance and not being able to work if he does n't get feeling better. Hopefully things will work out somehow.######If he is in fact Type2, the metformin will start having an effect after about 3 weeks. But if he is Type1, metformin wo n't do him any good and he will steadily get worse. The fact that the onset has been so quick, blood sugars of 500 + have been recorded, and he has lost weight suggest that it could be Type1. So watch it carefully.######He was diagnosed with type 2.######Sheila, From what I have heard and read, the side effects from metformin do go away after a while, but if they become intolerable, the best way to manage is to start from the beginning, with a very small dose, and then increase it gradually over a period of several weeks. Do n't know how much he 's taking, so ca n't tell if he 's on a large dose already or not. This is something you can work out with his doctor. Ruth######Thank you Ruth. He is on 500mg, 3 times a day.######There are people who 's pancreas produces no insulin. They are type 1. There are people who produce insulin but their body does n't use it well. They are type 2. And there are people in between who do n't produce quite enough or who 's body barely make due with what they produce. There are people borderline between the two. The progression of one to another sometimes occurs with age Doctors will try and use metformin and if your husband does n't get good control, they will try other medications and may eventually prescribe the use of insulin. Metformin is usually the first attempt. If it does n't work, there are several other weapons in the arsenal. I guess theoretically the minute you use insulin you are type 1. NIDDM is ``non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus '' (type2). IDDM is ``insulin depenant diabetes mellitus '' (type 1). I does n't really matter if he is type 1 or 2. The important thing is for him to get control, and if to do so, means insulin injections, so be it. They are not the end of the world, just think of them as a different form of medication. But for now, listen to the Dr. Metformin does a couple of things. I allows the insulin your husband has (assuming he is producing some) more efficiently. It also reduces the amount of sugar his liver produces. If he is responding to metformin, the chances are he does have some insulin production left. If it 's enough is to be determined. But remember, if not, insulin injections are not the end of the world. I hope this info helps. If it 's just annoying, let me know######I feel the need to correct a misconception here. Type1 Diabetes and Type2 Diabetes are clinically diseases and need to be treated in different ways. Type1 is an autoimmune disorder, whereas Type2 is the result of insulin resistance. While you ca n't progress from the one to the other, it is possible to have both Type1 and Type2 at the same time. The problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between them in the early stages, and Type 1 is often mis-diagnosed as Type 2. If the diagnosis was not based on insulin level and antibody test results, it could be wrong. As I mentioned in the previous post, normal weight, weight loss and very high blood glucose readings suggest that this could be the case. The fact there were no ketones could just mean that the pancreas is still producing enough insulin to stop this from happening. But things change fast in the onset of T1. And treating Type1 with type2 oral medications accelerates onset of the disease. Most importantly, these medications wo n't stop the development of ketoacidosis, which is dangerous condition. This is why it needs to be watched carefully at this stage.######Could n't have said it better myself, Mark! Also, even if T2 progresses to the point where one is insulin-dependent (as I am), it is STILL T2, not T1. It 's just T2 with a completely worn-out pancreas. Ruth######Unfortunately not all doctors and litterature use the terms the way you do. Some refer to type 1 as insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 as non insulin dependent (NIDDM). They seem to classify the result, i.e ``do I need insulin ''. You have classified them, as some doctors and litterature by the underlying issue, ie deterioration of the beta cells in the pancreas vs deterioration of the bodies ability to use insulin, that may lean to a burn out of insulin production. In your language, is IDDM type 1 and NIDDM type 2 or are those terms meaningless?######No, Type1 is not equal to IDDM and Type2 is not equal to NIDDM. And yes, it is unfortunate that the terminology has become so confusing. I think it highlights the shortcomings of defining a disease by its symptomatic characteristics. It makes much more sense to define a disease in terms of what causes it. But up until the 1970's, the distinction between the respective causes of what we now know as Type1 and Type2 diabetes were not well understood. So it was easier to call them IDDM and NIDDM. The terms Juvenile Onset Diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes were used for similar reasons. Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years. It is not uncommon for young people to become insulin resistant and for older people to have an autoimmune attack on their beta cells. It is also common for someone with insulin resistance to lose all beta cell function and become totally dependent on injected insulin (like Ruth). Also consider that an insulin dependent T2 is not the same as a T1 (who is also insulin dependent). The presence of insulin resistance means that additional treatment options may have to be considered. The net effect is that those old terms have lost their descriptive exclusivity. This is why usage of the IDDM/NIDDM and Juvenile/Maturity Onset Diabetes terminology has been superseded by ``Type1 '' and ``Type2 '' diabetes. These terms are both well understood in terms of the respective etiology, and the risk of mis-diagnosis has been brought into focus. This is what I was commenting on in the earlier post. It is easy to misdiagnose a T1 as T2 in the early stages. Doctors still use age and size as diagnostic guidelines and do n't do the required tests. Use of the old terms, IMO, is not helpful and just causes a lot of confusion. Mark######To highlight the lack of clarity, this from the definition page of the canadian diabetes association. (url) http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/dictionary.asp[/url] TYPE 1 DIABETES (or insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas no longer produces any or very little insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar as an energy source. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and affects 10% of people with diabetes. TYPE 2 DIABETES (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs or the insulin is not metabolized effectively. Type 2 usually occurs later in life and affects 90% of people with diabetes..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Diabetes is a disease wherein the body fails to manufacture or properly use insulin.Insulin is an agent of the blood sugars that is used as a source of energy throughout the body.Although the liver uses insulin for the storage of glycogen, a processed form of glucose. In a person with Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin that is produced does not work properly, and the sugars are not able to get into some of the cells.######There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is sometimes called insulin-dependent, immune-mediated or juvenile-onset diabetes. It is caused by an auto-immune reaction where the bodyâ$ s defence system attacks the insulin-producing cells. The reason why this occurs is not fully understood. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually occurs in children or young adults. People with this form of diabetes need injections of insulin every day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood. If people with type 1 diabetes do not have access to insulin, they die. Type 2 diabetes is sometimes called non-insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes do not usually require injections of insulin. Usually, they can control the glucose in their blood by watching their diet, taking regular exercise, oral medication, and possibly insulin. Type 2 diabetes is most common in people older than 45 who are overweight. However, as a consequence of increased obesity among the young, it is becoming more common in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes. If people with type 2 diabetes are not diagnosed and treated, they can develop serious complications, which can result in an early death. Worldwide, many millions of people have type 2 diabetes without even knowing it. Others do not have access to adequate medical care. The onset of type 2 diabetes is also linked to genetic factors but obesity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet increase the risks. Some women develop a third, usually temporary, type of diabetes called â$ gestational diabetesâ$ when they are pregnant. Gestational diabetes develops in 2-5% of all pregnancies, but usually disappears when the pregnancy is over. Women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on.

Many times people are get depressed. But weight loss is one of the very good way to control diabetes..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

I went to the diabetes center yesterday to get a monitor and have them show me how to use it. I 'm supposed to check my blood sugar levels 4 times a day: before breakfast and 2 hours after each meal. When I went in, it was three hours after I had eaten, but we took it anyway and recorded it like it had been 2. It was 109. Now, the guidelines she gave me says I do n't want it to be above 120 at the 2-hours-after mark. So 109 is pretty significantly lower (i think), but I did n't think much about it because it had been an extra hour. I took it again two hours after dinner, and it was 92. This morning it was 70. I do n't know what the morning number is supposed to be, but that still seems low to me. My fasting number, which is pretty much the same thing, when I took the glucose test was 96, and the nurse commented on how ``great '' that was because it was so low. But 70? Maybe I do n't know anything, but those numbers seem really low to me. I do n't want to call and be freaking out or anything until I have a full day of testing under my belt, but I was wondering if anybody here knew anything about it. How low is too low? Should I be concerned?######I just took my three hour long glucose test yesterday and im worried that it will come back bad. Pretty sure it will. I dont know if I can freaking prick my fingers like that... Ahhhh makes me queasy thinking about it. The dr said it can get so worse as to inject insulin too ??? I hope you find out your answers = 0 \############I dont know a week ago I took the hour long test, they took my blood I drank the nasty sprite stuff. . Waited an hour and they took my blood the test came back bad so I had to do the same thing but for three hours and they took my blood 4 times, once before and once every hour into the test up till the fourth hour. They didnt do that with you?######Yes, they did. But what i 'm saying is that when they prick your finger, they know within seconds what your sugar levels are. They should n't be making you wait to get the results; they knew the results when you were sitting right there. It 's not like they have to send bloodwork to a lab or something. Heck, I knew before the last prick on my three-hour test that I had failed it because I was already high on two of the numbers.######Oh I havent pricked my finger yet I just took the four hour test yesterday and they said if any two of them come back high I have gestational diabities which im pretty sure they will. I used to have highinsulin a few years ago when I was overweight so thats why the dr wanted to do this test early. Also every single time I eat I get tired and when I stand everything goes black. Something tells me its all connected. I should find out in a few days how the test came out and when I do she said that I have to come in and learn about all that pricking and stuff, see a dietition and some kind of group thing.######Yes, they have pricked your finger. If you did the glucose tolerance test, that 's what they do... Besides, you said they pricked your finger. Each time they prick your finger during that test, they are checking to see if your blood sugar levels are within a certain range. If it 's too high, then that 's bad. They would have known when they did the test if your levels were too high, there is nothing to ``wait '' on. Anyway... Someone * please * answer my question ?????######They took a tube of blood each time from my arm, the never pricked my finder. Hope you get your answer######That 's weird. Anyway, good luck to you. I 'm sure everything will be ok either way.######When I had my 1hr they pricked my finger... But when I had my three hour they drew 4 tubes of blood. I still go my results the next day. Didnt' need to worry abut it. When I had fainting spells they checked my blood and told me that I needed to make sure I ate something like an apple and drink a clear soda... It always made me feel better right away. They gave me the moniter too and as long as it was above 60 I was ok. But now I don; t have the spells anymore and I do n't have to prick my finger anymore.############My grandmother is diabetic and its disgusting now I know pregnancy induced diabetes is different and does go away 95% if you take care of urself this is what I do know some of it is from hubby... Carbs are really bad (basically they are spoons of sugar but come out later) taters, anything bread, carrots pretzels, chip etc naturals sugars you eat in halves so have half an apple in the morning the other in the afternoon just as an example. Make sure ur meals are complete 1/4 of ur plate should have stuff from every food group besides that ur about average for blood sugar 109 is quite high and 70 is kinda playing it on the average-normal side. Best of luck lalee just as an fyi for anyone if you have gestational diabete and do not take care of urself/eat healthy/moderation/diet it is very possible your diabetes may carry over past the pregnancy so take care of urself now! Hubby said its really gross when people come in with diabetes, it slowly kills you and your skin dies he said the smell can be somewhat bad now majority of people who have it did do it to theselves for not taking care of themseles unfortunatly there is people who never asked for it!############I had to sign up in order to respond to this post. I am a certified diabetes educator. The information that diamondsz provided is not only dangerous, but can be construed as prejudice advice to all with diabetes. Everything that diamondz said is wrong. 1) having diabetes is ``not disgusting. '' people who think it is do not even know what diabetes means. 2) gestational diabetes usually goes away, but a person with gestational diabetes is at risk for developing it again in future pregnancies, or type 1 diabetes (we 'll get to that). 3) carbs are not bad at all. Everything you eat consists of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You can not avoid carbohydrates, and in fact, probably consume 60% of them. There are many, many kinds of carbohydrates. I would get into that, but it would take weeks of writing to tell you about it. 4) spoon fulls of sugar is bad, like she said, but it is bad for everyone. Being diabetic does n't mean it 's bad. If you ever, ever say, ``oh my god, that person is diabetic, they ca n't be eating that (insert desert item here)! '' , you need to stick your foot in your mouth. Especially if you ca n't even tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All of the ``meal plan '' advice that has been provided by diamondz are just platitudes. It is impossible to do an armchair diagnosis of a person. Use this boards as support, not as medical advice. The fyi by diamondz is even more misleading. She claims that if you do n't take care of yourself now, then you 'll have diabetes later in life. This is not true. (we 'll get to that, too.) her ``hubby '' is wrong about diabetes, and it 's shameful that he be claimed to be an authority in this field. It 's all wrong, wrong, and wrong. Yes, uncontrolled diabetes leads to complications. Please note... Uncontrolled. This means different things to different types of diabetes. I wish diamondz did n't spread the common ``media belief '' of diabetes on this board. The following information is true: there are two major classifications of diabetes; type 1, and type 2. Of all the cases of diabetes in the world, between 5-10% of people in the world have type 1 diabetes; the remainder have type 2 diabetes. Of all the people who have type 2 in the world, there are over 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes. Four of the 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes are caused by lack of exercise, poor diet, and insulin resistance. This can sometimes be blamed on the person for not exercising or eating poorly-- in fact, most of the time, it is based on food. But some forms of type 2 diabetes are not the fault of the person. Hence, diamondz calling it ``gross '' is totally abusive in her ``authority. '' some people who have type 2 have gotten it because of cancer drugs (chemotherapy). So the next time you call a type 2 diabetic ``gross '', you 'd better have your facts straight-- they could be a five-time cancer survivor, and you 've just hurt their feelings for living. Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by diet, exercise, and sometimes oral medications called insulin sensitizers or incretin mimetics. Now, to the important type of diabetes-- type 1. Type 1 diabetes does not occur based on anyone's choice. It hits randomly. I said randomly. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction. Do you know anyone with ms? Lupus? Celiac disease? These are all autoimmune conditions. Type 1 diabetes can hit anyone-- at any time. It 's commonly called ``juvenile diabetes '' because it frequently occurs in younger people, but it can happen at any age. For every one-hundred diabetics that reads this message, five to ten of them have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 means their pancreas does not produce insulin, so it must be supplied through an insulin injection. So long as the person tests their blood glucose frequently, and adjusts for carbohydrate/fat/protein intake at meals, they can ``think like a pancreas '' and keep glucose values in normal ranges. This is not an easy job-- it is a full time job. This is a very complex subject, so i 've only touched the surface. There are basal insulins, bolus insulins, and a very complex world of diabetes management. If a person does not manage their blood glucose levels, they are more prone to diseases that affect small blood vessels (like retinopathy, kidney problems, neuropathy, and the list goes on). Please-- do not look at kids with type 1 and say they 're doomed. If they are in control of their diabetes, they live just as long. And with modern technology (e.G. Home blood glucose testing), complications of diabetes are reduced. Type 2 diabetes complications are of the same manner. These are the target populations that give type 1 diabetes a bad, bad name-- diamondz comments are evidence of this. I will respond to lalee's question in the following message.######Lalee, now to answer your question. Gestational diabetes is an interesting topic to me. It 's believed that in some women, insulin resistance causes the diabetic symptoms (it can be seen like type 2 diabetes), where in other cases, it models type 1 diabetes (where the mother's beta cells stop producing insulin in sufficient quantities). Home blood glucose meter kits have a +/ -20% error. This means that if you see 100mg/dl on the screen, it could be anywhere between 80 and 120 mg/dl. The purpose of the meter is tell a story of your trends. If you were showing 200 mg/dl on many occassions, this trend would be a flag about a problem. Showing 121 mg/dl does not mean you have diabetes... Even showing 140 mg/dl does not prove anything, because of the margin of error on the test kits. This fact should help to relax you a bit. Each of those tests costs$ 1.00, so it 's hard to experiment with the meter without costing a fortune. The average blood glucose level of humans, according to quest diagnostics statistics, is 85 mg/dl. This is a plasma level. This means that including post-meal, pre-meal, and fasting conditions, a person without diabetes averages, in their lifetime, 85 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose levels fall below 60 mg/dl. Some people may experience it, and simply eating a meal (or candy) can raise blood glucose back up. You might feel shakey, confused, tired, annoyed, scared, and even sweaty during hypoglycemia. This is because stress hormones turn on in the body in an attempt to raise blood glucose-- this hormone is called glucagon. When a type 1 diabetic takes too much insulin, or does too much exercise, their blood glucose can drop-- hence their need to chomp on fast acting carbohydrates (such as dextrose). Hyperglycemia is defined as the condtion when glucose is higher than 180 mg/dl. If you give even the healthiest person in the world a bunch of candy, they will rise above 120 mg/dl. The person training you probably was reading the brochure and standard training literature. And they probably do n't know that a meter has a +/ -20% error rate. (i actually see the one-touch ultra, and if you read the small print documentation, you 'll see this is the fact). Make sure your meter code is set for the test strips you 're using-- this can skew your results a bit when it does n't match the test strip vial. 70 mg/dl is normal for waking up. The values you have presented show no signs of hyperglycemia (diabetes). If you are ever worried about having low blood glucose, just eat. Typically, you will find yourself at a low glucose level in the mornings, since you have n't eaten much. If you get up and wait 30 minutes before testing, you 'll discover that your body (specifically, your liver) releases glucose to raise you in order to help you ``hunt for food. '' you have nothing to be concerned about. I 'm going to give one more lesson for any other readers out there. Why are we concerned with gestational diabetes? Well, here's why. Insulin is a hormone that turns glucose (sugar) into fat. That 's it. Yes, very simple. People who lack insulin can not turn glucose into fat, so their bodies ``starve to death ''-- people with type 1 diabetes before 1921 (the invention year of insulin) would die, despite whatever they ate. Type 2 diabetes is defined as insulin resistance-- meaing that their body has plenty of insulin, but for some reason, is not able to use it (i could speak for hours on this topic.) you have beta cells in your pancreas that release insulin in response to high glucose values. (this is why a type 1 takes insulin when they eat, or when they need to lower their hyperglycemia into normal glycemia, which is in the range of 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl). I 'm leaving out a lot of details here... But basically, here 's the problem. If your blood glucose goes really high, the baby will produce insulin in order to lower the blood glucose in its body. You see, you share what is in your body with the baby's body. If your blood glucose is high, the baby's blood glucose will be high, too. So what does the baby do? The baby's pancreas produces insulin to compensate. This insulin, though, does not travel out to the mother's body. Instead, it works to lower glucose in the baby. Read back to what I said that insulin does. It builds fat. Here's why gestational diabetes is a bad thing: 1) the baby will come out weighing 10 + pounds... Not exactly a thing you want going through you, right? 2) high blood glucose increases the chance of bacteria to set up shop, because glucose is the essential food for all life, including bacteria; 3) having high glucose in the mom can cause oxidative stress, meaning, the mom will feel yucky; 4) having high glucose in mom can result in mom's beta cells working too hard-- if they work too hard, they will become damaged, and the mom could potentially be left with type 1 diabetes, which can occur anywhere from one day after birth to... You guessted it... A risk lasting the rest of her life. Some women have 3 kids, and end up with type 1 diabetes. Sorry for all the lessons, but I really saw a lot of information that was way out of line in this thread. Diabetes should not and does not have a negative image associated with it, as diamondz was presenting. You should never define a person with diabetes as beign a ``diabetic '' in a social situation; would you call a person with cancer something like a ``that peson with cancer '' or a person confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis (ms) a ``multiple schleratic ''? I do n't think so. If you or anyone else has questions about diabetes, please feel free to contact me. Typos are the mistake of me writing this at 2 am. I hope this helps to lower your concerns. Also, I could go into the whole world of the glucose tollerance tests (gtt) that some of you have experienced, but I think this is more than enough information to digest for now. Btw, there are people who have ``hypoglycemia ''-- where they produce too much insulin, or become hypoglycemia after eating a high carbohydrate meal. (their body responds with insulin for the meal, but the insulin hangs around too long, causing cells to turn too much of that glucose into fat). Did you know that an average person has 6 grams of glucose in their blood? That 's why diabetes is so hard to manage... If you just add one extra gram of sugar in the body, it can raise glucose values by 40 mg/dl or even more (depending on weight). Okay, i 've said enough on this. I really hope diamondz takes back what she 's said about diabetes, and that she needs to have her husband, if he 's in the medical establishment, to stop telling her what he 's ``heard. '' by the way, a person's glucose can change by 300 mg/dlin as little as one hour. So do n't sweat the small changes. If you 're between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl while fasting, you 're doing great. Two hour post-meal (also called post-prandial) should be under 120 mg/dl, though some scientists believe 140 mg/dl is just as fine, so long as fasting levels return to below 100 mg/dl. These values are played with all the time, but since your home test kit is only correct within 40% of the actual value (+20% to -20%), you ca n't freak out. Now if you keep getting results that are high, or after eating, then you can be concerned a bit more. If you have more diabetes questions, I highly recommend going to the american diabetes association website (www.Diabetes.Org) and go to the message board, and post questions in the appropriate forum. You will have very well grounded and experienced people there that can assist you with your questions.######Weird, my capitalizations on certain words has been modified... For example, quest diagnostics is the name of a business, and should be with a capital ``q '' and a capital ``d '', but when I saved the message, it was placed in lower-case format. Needless to say, the above messages I posted are not how I wrote them. This forum must modify cases to their own non-english standard. -- oh, and one more thing... Labs do n't necessarily test with a glucose meter. For the person who had blood drawn into a tube at each hour, this is because they are sending the blood in for accurate tests. Their glucose meters are the same as the ones you can buy off the shelf. That means they still have that +/ -20% error. The blood they put in a tube, however, will be sent to a lab, spun on a centrafuge, and testsed. The margin of error for lab-tested blood is typically less than 2% (that means a 4 mg/dl error range), which is much, much, much, much more accurate than a home glucose meter.######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Points to Remember What is diabetes? a disorder of metabolism-- the way the body digests food for energy and growth What are the main types of diabetes? type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes gestational diabetes What is the impact of diabetes? affects 17 million people is a leading cause of death and disability costs$ 132 billion per year Who gets diabetes? people of any age people with a family history of diabetes most common in older people, overweight and sedentary people, African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Where Is More Information Available?

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. How Is Diabetes Managed?

Just found out that my two sisters have diabetes, and hoping I do n't. Can someone tell me what your first symptoms were of diabetes. My sister said that she would get hot and sweaty and could n't lose weight.######Hot, sweaty, and not able to lose weight are not symptoms of diabetes. Weight loss, palore, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue are symptoms.######Okay thanks, I thought that not being able to lose weight was not one of the symptoms.######Lady50, I read in a Diabetes journal that there is a connection between Diabetes and NOT being able to lose weight. I know for myself, I tried different approaches to losing weight but did n't get results. Since recently being told I 'm Diabetic I started to watch my carb intake and carb mixtures for the past month to have control of my sugar numbers and already seen a reduction in my weight. It may be more of eating a healthier low carb diet but I also think since my sugar is at a steady pace- it 's easier for me to get the weight off. \* I also do get hot and sweaty but I 'm 46- that 's just plain ol' mother nature. PollyAnn######The not being able to lose weight may be what causes Type 2, but it is definitely not a symptom of diabetes. When you have diabetes, you are n't able to properly use carbohydrates for energy, so you urinate them out. This basically results in your peeing out your number 1 energy source, forcing your body to burn fat rapidly. Therefore, weight loss is a symptom.######Thats not exactly it but close. The Problem comes from No Insulin. Type 1 Diabetics will ofton see the weight loss but Type2's usually wont. When there is not any insulin in the body at all the body cant do many things, Insulin is responsible for Moving Glucos from the Blood stream to where it is needed. Which includes to Glycogen for energy and to fat for storage. Without any insulin the body also cant rebuild muscle as it gets broken up when used. So you end up losing tons of muscle. Unfortunately many Type 2 Diabetics actually do not experience any symptoms at all.######I visited a Diabetes Support group and the first thing I noticed was that everyone there was overweight. My thoughts were `is this the way I 'm heading with my Diabetes'. I have about 25lbs to lose but these people were a lot heavier. I went to gain knowledge from others that are in the same boat but at first I felt a little odd. Everyone was very nice, had different types of Diabetes and ranged in all ages. There was a 13-year-old girl who takes insulin and even she was overweight. Does insulin cause you to gain weight? I also learned from this group that most everyone has other serious issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure and lung problems. And the women in the late 40's age said they were dealing with Menopause symptoms and think possibly that Diabetes is making the symptoms worst for both their Diabetes and Menopause. It was n't the place for me but it 's nice that there are such place for support.######I agree type 2 diabetics do n't always show weight loss or any symptoms at all, but I do n't believe only people with type 1 experience weight loss. My pathophysiology text book lists weight loss as a symptoms for both types. Type 1s will lose more weight for the reasons you mentioned, but they will overall have more symptoms since their blood sugar will raise at a much more rapid pace. Once blood sugars reach over 180, most people will be peeing out glucose, since that is generally the renal threshold for glucose.######Thank you all so much. I have another question, hope ya all do n't mind. Right now I am like dead broke, and wanted to get a diabetes test since 2 sisters of mine have it. I was thinking of going to the local Health Department and get a finger \*\*\*\*\* blood sugar test. Do you think this test would detect diabetes in me. If your bloodsugar is quite high, does that mean diabetes. I have read that urinalysis is a good test, since there should be no sugar in the urine. This finger \*\*\*\*\* bloodtest will only cost me 3 bucks.######correction: should have said finger poke instead of the other word.LOLLOL######If both your sisters have it, I would think the easiest way to detect it would be asking one of them to test you. If it 's high, my suggestion to you is to get health insurance before you get diagnosed by a doctor.######It 's all very confusing to me. I thought Diabetes I was when your body ca n't produce insulin at ALL. that 's why it has to be injected. Type II diabetes is totally different and it 's not insulin that they 're taking by pill form. the medication they take by pill form helps regualte their blood sugar in type II. Insulin ca n't be produced in pill form. only with injection. type II can be cured by changing the diet. It 's proven. It 's very technical and can be down right confusing. hypoglycemia, vs reactive hypoglycemia is different from eachother too. I need a good book to describe and illistrate to me in detail what each one is. in laymans terms or dummy form like they make dummy books for computers. the longer I go with having low blood sugar attacks, the worst my being able to understand anything in an orderly fashion is diminishing. it 's very frustrating. maybe there 's a book out there in the market for me. anyone have any suggestions? Linda######There are several types of diabetes. type 1- the immune system attacks it 's own pancreas. This results in the insulin producing cells no longer being able to produce insulin. The blood glucose raises rapidly and dangerously. As no insulin is present, external insulin must be provided through injection or a pump. type 2- this is a bit more complicated. In type two, for some reason, the cells stop responding to the insulin being produced. Basically, insulin acts as the gatekeeper for the cells, allowing glucose to enter the body cells. Think of it as the gatekeeper falling asleep on the job. To make up for this, ``reinforcements '' are sent in. The body just keeps making more insulin so blood glucose can be maintained at a somewhat normal level, though the level does raise. Eventually, the body ca n't make any more insulin, so lack of insulin production becomes a sign of type 2 at some point in time. Gestational- basically in this one, the fetus takes all the glucose away from mom's body. So mom's body tries to not store glucose, but keep it all in the blood instead. The glucose raises. Also, some resistance is present due to the added weight. MODY- maturity onset diabetes of youth. This is a rare genetic form of diabetes. Basically, the body is born not being able to make enough insulin (but it makes some), and it gets worse with age. Diet and exercise can be used at first, then meds, then insulin. LADA- latent onset autoimmune diabetes of adults. Think of this as an adult getting Type 1. It 's a form of type 1 diabetes, but the onset is slower and at an older age.######update: My sister checked my bloodsugar with the finger poke bloodtester. Before I ate, it was 140, after eating it was 117. A few hours later, it dropped down to 57. This is when I was feeling a bit shakey inside.Then I was craving sweets like mad. This is weird that it dropped so low.######Sounds like reactive hypoglycemia.######Thank you for helping me with this. I will be looking that up..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With Type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes may include fatigue, thirst, weight loss, blurred vision and frequent urination. Some people have no symptoms. A blood test can show if you have diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.######Great! So, do you recommend standard medications (drugs)?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

Thanks######If your brother has Type 1 diabetes, the only treatment is to use insulin, either with syringes (shots) or through an insulin pump. There currently is no permanent cure except a pancreas transplant, and they usually do n't do those unless the kidneys are also failing. If your brother has Type 2 diabetes, then it would be treated initially with diet, exercise and possibly oral medication. If he 's overweight and loses most of the excess weight, he then might not need any medication at all. But if he IS Type 2, it 's important that he not delay in treating it, as the blood sugar must be stabilized as soon as possible while he is attempting to lose the excess weight. I 'm assuming that it 's more likely that he 's a Type 1. A regimen of a shot of long-acting insulin taken once a day, coupled with rapid-acting insulin taken before eating and geared to the amount of carbs he will be eating, is the best way to control Type 1.

Ever since my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer a few years ago I 've been incredibly careful with my diet. I 'm thin, I exercise religiously and I eat very few carbs. I do n't eat pasta, rice, candy, refined sugar of any kind and I do n't drink soda or alcohol. The only bread I eat is a single slice of sprouted grain bread in the morning. Other than that it 's veggies, lean proteins, nuts, dairy and the occassional piece of fruit. I promise you- I 'm not exagerrating. So as I said, I was surprised when my blood sugar came back high on the test. I bought a monitor and test strips and started testing my blood sugar levels and what 's weird is I find that when I do n't eat for a few hours (especially if I work out really vigorously) I feel shaky and anxious- but I test my blood and the sugar levels are high. I 'm so confused. After I eat, they go back down a bit. My fasting levels are in the normal range... I 'm concerned because I had an uncle who had Type 1 diabetes that was n't diagnosed til he was almost 50... I 'd really appreciate any insights. Thank you so much.######First off, what do you mean by ``high ''? Different folks have different standards. If it is actually high, then it could be your liver dumping glucose in response to your body's requirement for energy. It 's not that selective though and tends to over do it.######Hi Cdmom, I would ask my doctor to give me an A1c test. That will let you and your doctor know what your average blood sugars have been running for the past three months. You need to find out if you are a diabetic.######I agree with Cora that your liver could be dumping glucose because of a need for it due to exercise (perhaps). Your comments about your weight (not heavy) and what you eat (or do n't eat) can only suggest to us that you are probably not developing type 2 diabetes. My own familiarity is with type 1 diabetes, not type 2. My son has type 1 and celiac disease and I can tell you sometimes his blood sugar rises without food: that just means he needs at that moment a higher dose of the basal insulin (he takes Levemir for that). I 'm wondering what happens when you eat a high carb food (if you ever do). Since you have BG testing equipment at home, you could actually give yourself a glucose challenge. The procedure is to test in the morning on an empty stomach, then drink two cans of soda (or juice with equivalent carb content), then test an hour and two hours later (or more if you like). Two hours later I believe you are expected to be below some number (I think it is 140 but maybe others here can confirm that). We have never done the glucose test at home, but an endo at one point told me how one does it, and commented it is easily done at home if you have the meter for measuring blood sugar. I 'm a little concerned you could be developing type 1 (although I am not a doctor so do n't get too upset by just me suggesting it). If you ate a high carb diet one would expect the main issue to be your body's inability to deal with consumed sugars (or carbs). If you are really eating such a very low carb diet as it seems you might be, then perhaps your body is struggling to produce the maintenance dose of insulin needed (which normally does not happen with t1d until a little later I think). My son for example, for some months after his t1d still produced enough insulin that he needed no basal dose, just doses for meals (but his meals were typical meals with some carb content). Our bodies do need a little insulin all the time, not just to deal with the food we eat. Still it seems a little far fetched that you could be short on this low level of needed basal insulin (by your body not producing enough), and I think the liver dumping sugar explanation might make more sense. In any case, you could do your own home glucose challenge and find out the answer if you wanted, or you could go to an endo who specializes in diabetes (hopefully not just type 2) and you could also get an answer there. Good luck.######Thank you so much!######Thanks for your suggestion. My insurance covers basically nothing so I 've been hesitant to ask for more testing, but I think you 're right- I need to find out for sure if I 'm diabetic. I really appreciate how quickly the kind folks on this board reply!######Thank you so much- I will definitely try that. It 's interesting you mentioned celiac disease: my family history has several autoimmune diseases in it, celiac disease being one of them. I hope your son is well. My sister's son has celiac and it 's meant an enormous amount of adjustment and learning. I 'm always amazed by the power of mothers to basically give themselves medical educations on behalf of their kids. Thanks again.######Hi! Perhaps you have a stress syndrome expressing glycemic surges from stress hormone elevations, e.g. ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine, responsive to the situation concerning your husband. Have you had the the appropriate blood chemistry profiles to determine whether that might be the case? If were found to be the case, or if it were suspected, on competent examination, perhaps you 'd consider therapy, talk or chemical. Best of luck. CT######Wow- thank you so much. I had n't considered that. I think I 'm going to have to ask for more info & testing from the doctor. Best to you, cdmom.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

After a 2 hour GTT my numbers hovered around 200. A reactive hypoglycemia landed me in the ER after that test. I 'm doing a five hour GTT next week. I 've seen lows of 30 several times and an occasional ``Lo '' on my glucometer. Normally, I 'm responsive-- if a little disoriented and a light-headed. I have so many questions! Type I or Type II? I thought hypoglycemia came from too much insulun? My grandmother was called ``brittle '' diabetic. She was diagnosed at age 20-- what does this mean? and how does it relate to me-- is it hereditary? I 'm 32 and 5 ' 9 '' 130#-- I 've been watching my diet and excercise-- so I feel a little frustrated by all of this. Any input would be appreciated.######I am sorry to hear that you are having to go through all of this. If it is any comfort, this is a condition that is all about control. You can control it and live a normal happy life. It isnt like cancer where it just takes you over and you are helpless. At this point, there is no way of knowing what type it would be. You are a little old for type 1 but a little young for type 2. I would figure that they will type you according to the treatment you require. Seeing that you are reactive hypoglycemic and your numbers did not go sky high with the GTT, you are probably type 2. Type 1 diabetes is not hereditary. Your grandmother being brittle meant that conventional treatment did not control it. Believe it or not, math has alot to do with type 1 control. You learn how much insulin to take for how many carbs you eat. How much will 1U of insulin bring your blood sugar down. Being brittle means that thos numbers just dont work so you have to play with it constantly to get control. Type 2 diabetics have been known to be brittle the longer they have it. Type 2 has also been related to skipping a generation. That is another reason I would think they will type you as 2. Hypoglycemia can sometimes be called Reactive. This means that your pancreas rebounds and gives you too much insulin. This is a sign that your pancreas is still working though not as it should. Good luck to you and let us know what you find out. Right now I would do everything in moderation and keep track of your blood sugars so you can show them what is going on. HTH######Usually one's type is determined by a test called C-peptide. This test measures a by-product of insulin production and through it they can determine if you 're still producing insulin and approximately how much. It is quite possible that you have a form of hypoglycemia... as those reactive episodes would seem to indicate. Hypoglycemia is, however, frequently a precursor to Type 2 diabetes. I would hazard a guess that your doctor is scheduling the 5-hour GTT to determine if you are actually diabetic truly hypoglycemic at this stage. Either way, diet plus possibly some medication should work to stabilize your blood glucose. For hypoglycemia, diet is usually all that 's needed.######What do they do for the C Peptide test? I have heard of it but do n't know if I have ever had one.######Hello Mindy Here is a link to explain about C-Peptide. It is fairly clear what and how to decide type 1 or type 2 diabetes (url) http://www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part1/section-10.html[/url] Don######Thanks Don... That is wonderful to finally find out. All of this time, I have been rocking along thinking I had been typed by my treatment. Pills did nothing for me and since I was 21 and overweight when I was diagnosed, there was question. I have been told before that I have no c peptide so I guess that would make me a true type 1. Thanks again######This sounds like Reactive Hypoglycemia (RH) rather than frank diabetes, at least at this point. It may turn into diabetes later, when the pancreas's Beta cells wear out. The only good treatment for RH is to go on a VERY low carb diet, eliminating all fast absorbing carbs such as rice, potatos, grain products (bread, etc), sugar, corn and peas from the diet and relying instead on proteins and good fats. As time goes on you may find that YOUR body will tolerate various carbs, but that takes careful experimentation and you should wait for later taking tem one at a time. Try looking at the following website: (url) http://www.fred.net/slowup/hypo.html[/url] They explain it very well at length there. As a matter of fact I went there some years ago to help my nw step-mother learn how to control her RH. When we visited she had several hypos soon after eating, but I got her to change her diet and her life improved immeasurably. She even lost weight and felt better generally. Tht was after she had known she had RH for about 50 years, and doctors could n't seem to ko how to help her. Many doctors still do n't believe that RH is possible, so good care for it is problematical at best.######Thanks for all your wonderful help. I 've been making the low-carb food choices, and I have felt better these last few days. My five hour GTT is tomorrow. I 'll let you know how it goes (if I survive the Thanksgiving feast!) ..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I am not as physically fit as I used to be but I still swim and play basketball weekly. My diet consist of fatty foods and I hardly drink beer but when I do it 's binge drinking, around 5-6 beers about once or twice a month. I went to ER complaining of stools without any pain at all, so they ran stool test, blood work and ct scan and everything was fine but my lipase levels were EXTREMELY elevated at 1700. They admitted me to hospital for a few days and I responded well to clear liguid diet the first day, I was retested and my lipase next morning was at 1050, still high but a significant reduction. Next morning it jumped to 1130. I was shocked and was upset that the lipase was not going down. All my lipids, liver panels and cbc were normal. GI doc said he 's certain it was acute pancreatitis. He then ordered a 2nd CT scan this time with oral and IV contrast and once again, it was clear but GI doc not did talk to me about results, he sent nurse in to send me home. They sent me home only telling me to lay off alcholol and see him in 2 weeks. Why would any responsabile doctor, especially GI send someone home with a dangerous lipase of 1130? I was shocked again. This still left me with many unanswered questons. Maybe you guys can help me out. 1. I get abdominal pain and sometimes mild diarrhea after drinking moster energy drinks, dairy and iced coffee drinks. Pain always lasted for a less than 5 mins and relieved after bowel movement, I never had pain that persisted for hours. I also associated this brief pain with IBS. No D if I stay away from those trigger foods. Does pancreatitis always create severe abominable pain lasting for more several hours? 2. How can a doctor tell if it 's acute or chronic pancreatitis? Can you have multiple acute attacks or is more than one attack considered chronic? From what I read CP eventually becomes less painful due to failing pancreas and amalyse levels are normal. Since I have no pain, I assume it 's CP and those small bouts of 5 minute pains were pancreatitis flare ups. 3. Anyone have insight of survival rate and lifespan with this condition if treated properly with low fat diet, exercise and abstinence from alcohol? I read it reduces lifepspan 10-20 years for any cp patient. 4. Does chronic marijuana use contribute to pancreatitis? I smoke tons of marijuana and I just switched to edibles after diagnosis, even though GI doc think it has nothing to do with it. Thanks.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

I 'm totally not the typical pancreatitis patient- female, thin, fit, good diet, minimal alcohol consumption, no visible gall bladder stones on ultrasound... I had the pancreatitis for 5 days before taking myself to hospital. In those 5 days I saw two different GPs. One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed.

I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment.

Spent a week in the hospital and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I was informed and told not to drink and being young and immature (24) I thought I could slip a beer or a drink in here and there which eventually led me back in the hospital for three days. Since then I stopped drinking for a while and one night at a graduation party had a few drinks which led to more drinks which led to pain but no hospital. I have now been sober since that day but I do have pain that comes here and there. When I went for a scan and bloodwork I saw my file and it said chronic pancreatitis. I am going to see a new doctor on the 21st. It seems like their is nothing much that can be done here but start eating better and NO DRINKING AT ALL. I only have my fathers insurance (which is a great insurance) until I am 26 which is 2 years from now. I really want to get the pancreas looked at to see how much damage I have done from drinking heavily since I was 19 years old. I was reading that I should maybe look into getting a contrast-enhanced pancreatic CT scan. Also what are thoughts on oxycodone and roxicet when you are diagnosed with pancreatitis? Sometimes I take these if I am in a little pain but read these might not be good for you if you have pancreatitis as well. What is the mortality rate from pancreatitis? How long do people normally live with this disease? Now that I have a little more informed I still get no definitive answers from doctors or gastros they all say the same thing which is eat healthy and do not drink. I still would like to know more. Thanks for any comments in advance. Brian######Okay I can only answer a few of your questions. I believe that pancreatitis is not cureable, it is manageable though, through diet and meds. As far as taking Oxycodone and Roxy's when your only in a little pain... thats way overdoing it. Heavy narcotics are dependance causing drugs if you take them for long periods of time. You also get used to them over time as your tolerance increases, so you have to take more and more to do the job. This is not a scenario you want to get into to control ``a little pain ''. These kinds of meds are meant for chronic conditions which cause major pain, we 're talking 8, 9, 10 on a scale of 1- 10, all day everyday. So you should really think about that. good luck, kat.######-Health Issues###-Pain Management

I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich, than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E.. When im with my friends. I 've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana? Well, heres to everybody whos had to go through this damn disease, life aint over yall: wink:######Hi, i just wanted to say- be careful! I first developed symptoms at 18, was diagnosed at 25 and i 'm now 32, and i 've had 25 attacks, three within the last three months.

I do n't think my ap is linked to alcohol either, but I have cut it out, just to be sure. If you have to drink, I tink you 're better off with `long ' drinks such as wine, beer, etc.. Do n't drink spirits! And, sorry to say, you 've got to stop smoking, completely. It sends all your risk levels through the roof, and you ca n't afford it. You are already at an increased risk of cancer of the pancreas- very deadly, so you have to minimise all the other risks! Above all, do n't mess with this illness. I 've had it for a long time; sometimes it leaves me alone for 18 months, other times it hits again and again, and just takes over. Every time you 're ill your pancreas gets damaged, and you need it to last you the rest of your life. When you see what ap can do to you, it gives you a new appreciation- it can get much, much worse, so play by the rules in order to keep yours as mild as possible for as long as possible. I know it 's boring- having ap when you 're young is a real pain, but treat it with respect! C######thats good advice my son was diagnosed at 16 he is now 23 and been in and out of hospital allot and once in icu whilst on holiday in turkey, he dont touch alcohol and he still gets flare ups its a very scary illness######If you want to ward off pancreatitis, you need to stop drinking completely and smoking also. I have had to deal with pancreatitis for many years now, but more so in the last nine months. I was on a feeding tube for four months, and did n't think I was going to live through the last two attacks. Believe me, you do n't want to do anything that is going to make pancreatitis a part of your life. The quality of my life is not very good at all at the moment, and I would n't wish this on anyone. I have never been a drinker, but I do n't see why you ca n't just order a ``virgin '' when out with your friends......############every time u drink ur amylase and lipase will increase if the food you cosume contains a lot of fat pain may increase.as for ur marijuna aftr consuption u feel hungery and consume more food which might cause pancreatitis.######Hello, drinking with pancreatitis is always a bad idea !! And yes it can be avoided even when out with friends. Become the regular designated driver !! The attacks of pain you have following every time you drink should tell you it is a bad idea... With each acute attack you have, you are one step closer to chronic pancreatitis. And believe me- you do not want to be chronic !! My first attack happened when I was 8 years old (now 48). I have been chronic for the last 6 years. It is life stealer !!! It do n't kill you but it will sometimes make you wish it did. It is disabling (i have not been able to work since 2001). The pain is 24/7 and no matter what you do it never goes away. Yet you also get attacks when the pain is unbearable. Additionally chronic pancreatitis leads to many other disorders- the worse of which is type 1 brittle diabetes- uncontrollable diabetes. This comes with all the side effects of diabetes. Malabsorption is another problem. You can literally starve to death, even though you are eating. It causes all kinds of vitamin and mineral inbalances with come with their own problems. Please think twice before you take another drink. Each drink puts you closer to being chronic... And there are many more problems associated with chronic pancreatitis that I am not listing here. Reeann############Hi all. I 've just had my first attack of Acute Pancreatitis. I was rushed to ER and they gave me morphine, put me on a drip, gave me loads of antibiotics and would n't let me eat. I must admit it was pretty scary- I went in to shock and very nearly died. So I 've just got out of hospital and I do n't know very much about what to do next. The doctors did n't give me any advice except to only eat light meals ?! I see that alcohol is bad- that 's ok can live without that! Can anyone give me any advice? Am I likely to get it again? Thank you... Emma######research and learn to eat, and be devoted to, a non fat diet. I did not say low fat, I said non fat. It is the most important thing and I do n't see it on these posts. Maybe people do n't know how to eat to live with this disease. Please google non fat diets. Work up some recipes you like and stick to them, and carry a tupperware container of these foods with you if you go out. NO ALCHOHOL whatsoever. Do n't even smell it. Put mustard on your sandwich, no cheese no mayo. No egg yolks, buy egg whites in a container and scramble. maybe a slice of non fat cheese on the top. No butter at all, not light butter, nothing of the sort. No birthday cake or pastries, have angel cake instead. Spend a year working on the non fat diet and you will adapt very quickly. Never go off it. this is the way you will live from now on. It takes attention but you will be able to live with it easily once you get the hang of it. Take yours with you, is my advice.############i had an episode of acute pancreatitis about 4 years back. It was intense pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the back.my glucose level was also slightly high. sinnce then i have stopped drinking completely. thereafter i never had any problems whatsoever.my glucose also is normal.but thereafter my calcium level is always low. now i am taking calcium supplements 3 times a day. the absorption is very poor. i also have to take vitamin d. can i now start drinking occasionaly.######My boyfriend has been hospitalized 4 times in the last year for pancreatitis but he continues to drink, now the doctor said this can kill him is that true? He does not seem to get it he thinks that they are just make things up can this kill him if he does not stop drinking ???######I 've had a very serious acute pancreatitis attack 3 days ago... the pain got worse throughout the day and at 1am in the morning I was n't able to take it anymore and asked my husband to bring me to the ER. I stayed in the ER for 6 hours, got an IV, they took my blood, urine samples, and did an ultrasound. It did not take them too long to figure out that I had acute pancreatitis, but they said they can not figure out why- I do n't really drink (maybe once in 4 months ??) and I do n't have gallstones- two of the most common causes for acute pancreatitis. I asked my mother if she had symptoms like that before or if it was in my family, and actually she said she had something like that before, similar pain, but back then they were not able to give her a correct diganosis (40 years ago). I am only 25, and had pain in my stomach before, however, I never took it seriously or it was never that bad that I had to go to the doctor or to the hospital. I have n't had any solid food in 3 days, I am scared to eat because of the pain. I am drinking lots of water and broth, but even decaf tea or chicken broth gives me pain, not too much, but I can tell that it takes time to get better. I got pain reliever like vicodin, which knock me out. I wonder if I can ever go back to my regular diet, I never really cared what I ate before, it was usually a very balanced diet, and sometimes it happened to be a bit fatty/oily. I will have a follow up appmt with my doctor next week and I 'll try to find out more if I have to adjust my diet from now on. Is it normal to feel pain when drinking broth/ tea after acute pancreatitis?######If drink was the cause of your acute pancreatitis, give it up, because when- and it will be when- you develop chronic pancreatitis, you 'll remember all those blase evenings of getting trashed with absolute regret, while being in total agony in the present and unable to think clearly about your fearsomely shortened future. Drink can be fun, until it is n't, and when it 's threatening your wellbeing, just give it up. Seriously. i ca n't put into words the extent to which you 'll rue the day you carry on.######hey guys.... . im 16 yrs old i have had two attacks of acute pancreatitis lol its acyually funny im sitting at mayo clinic now getting a bunch of tests done for this... i was first told i hace this two weeks before my 16 birthday and have since had to make a lot of lifestyle changes... i used to drink about 3 times a month with my buddys but havnt had a drop of alchahol since my first aattack... i also used to smoke cicgarettes (about a pack a day) but quit after my second attack... both times i was put on a low fat diet which is 50 grams of fat per day... for all who dont know that is about 5 tablespoons of mayonase !!!!! i was recently told i could continue a normal diet but have chosen not to... i guess i really dont want to take the risk of getting it again... for 1 it is way painfull... i dont know how many times i blacked out bc of it... and for two i am now repeating a semester of my sophmore yera bc i missed so much school and i just kind of gave up. . plus it really isnt worth the week in the hospital and not eating for three days.... if you ever want to know more or want to ask n e questions you can message me... ttyl guys....######i had ap to. almost died. multiple organ failure followed along with adult respitory distress syndrome. ap usually doesnt go this far but for me it did... my pancreas shot poison into my body. . making my lungs shut down... do i drink now? yes i do... just not as much... i do not expierence stomach pain when i do it though but am always watching for any sign of it, cause then id stop. Life goes on. Doctors will naturally tell you not to do it... but i dont worship that religion and a doctor is not a priest for me as it is for so many others. Listen to your inner most voice. . and it will tell you what you are allowed and what you are not. Pay attention to pain, it is there to warn you and tell you something is not right. I always had warning signs but unfortunately i did not listen to them... i thought drinking more would make the pain go away... and before you judge me... let me say this... im sick of encyclopidia people who believe everything they are told You have a disease... you must be aware of it, but you must live and be merry as well... be the designated drive... ha! some people arent that boring If i sound like a ahole... fine.... but im sick of hearing stupid advice that not based on fact the truth is they dont know where the limit it so they say dont do it at all... i say dont do it at all if you are too stupid to find your limit... but if not, find your limit and listen to your body...... and live and laugh... life is too short to go through it trying to prolong by erasing all the little pleasures... those who want the last years where u pee your bed and cant move... you go ahead and live healthy to die long.... i dont want to die long and im sick of your opra, self help answers######I am writting even though I it may be premature to do so. But I have been devasted by the news at the docs. I have had some discomfort in my right side abdomen just under the edge of my rib cage. I had an ultrasound done and the doc told me I have a cyst in my pancreas... now I am scheduled for a CT scan and I am freaking out of what it might be. The doctor has put a rush on it. . and this has made me even more nervous. I drink but mostly on weekdays, and usually have a beer daily... what is going on ??? I have had heart burn and bloating as well for some time, and many times loose stools. Guess I am looking for good news or something comforting... anyone know what is going on and should I worry ???######A Brief Journey of my pain In January 2010 I experienced my first symptoms of pain which turned out initially to be jaundice followed by a diagnosis of gallstones which meant an admission into hospital in early February 2010. After my first admission eating fatty foods was a key cause of the episodes of pain and was told by the consultant to have my gallbladder out 6 weeks ago but instead gave me 3 months to decide as I was not in a fit state of mind to decide whether I really wanted it so was expected to give him my decision on 13th July this year. I have continued to cut down on fatty foods and have lost almost 3 stones in weight since the beginning of the year, I am not grumbling about the weight loss however I would have preferred to do it differently avoiding pain attacks relating to food intake. I now eat substantially less and better variety of diet along with gentle exercise a few times a week, these pain occurrences have totally changed my life, clothes are loose and although I was t-total before now I will be for the indefinite future as I donâ$ t want food and alcohol relating to further pancreatitis so overall despite the discomfort in hospital I am much healthier and happier. Events superseded my decision to have my gallbladder out late July 2010 so in May this year was admitted again with gallstone induced pancreatitis which was extremely painful resulting a week or so later with my gallbladder removed. I was petrified of the operation but I had it done as I could not bear any more pain so I took the risk of general surgery via key hole. Waiting 8 hours in squelching UK heat was not pleasant especially when you are nil by mouth. On 29th June I was discharged from the consultant only to find a week later I was admitted with a further episode of an infection of the pancreas spending seven nights at the local hospital. Now I hope they have gone for good so when I see the consultant surgeon at the end of August I can try and be discharged for a second time. This time I had severe hiccups, excess sweating and lots of vomiting adding to jaundice, gallstone and acute pancreatitis, why do things in halves, all this when I donâ$ t drink, smoke, eat pretty healthily and have good health yet I have all of this unlucky or what.

Mark Crossley######hello all im 25 years old, i drank wine everyday for the past two years at least a bottle maybe two. i was jus released from the hospital today for pancreatitis. my levels were all off my pancreas was at 10,000 my potassium, and other electrolytes were low. i was in the hospital for 5 days the dr. told me i should not drink anymore as i could possible develop cronic pancreatitis. my question is did anyway experience a bloating around their abdomen or weight gain in that area after being released from the hospital? i was fed thru an iv and given pain pills so i cant understand what the reason would be for the weight gain. thanks in advance######Yes it is very normal to have bloating and gassy feeling when you are released from the hospital and it lasts for weeks until it is finally gone. Your stomach can look and feel huge! I am not sure about the weight gain except I know that the pain killers they give you cause you to be constipated and you need to be on stool softeners most times. I have been in the hospital 8 times with this and struggle to quit drinking but know if I do n't that I will develop chronic pancreatitis which will eventually kill me.######I just got out of the hospital today after four days in there. I was on the IV the whole time and I gained 10 pounds and my stomach is totally bloated still. I did not have any food till this morning, which was some of that hospital egg stuff. It did not hurt after eating it so my doc let me go home. The couple of doctors that I talked to said that I can go back to my regular diet (which consist of meat, dairy and junk, no fruits of vegies) as soon as I felt comfortable. They also told me to stop drinking for two weeks and then I can drink again. I do not drink every day and only have a couple of beers unless it is some sort of weekend away, then I can drink a lot.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago. I was in Tanzania when I got it and was rushed into hospital because the pain was unbearable. After 3 days there I flew back to England and remained in hospital for another 10 days. During my stay I had ultra sound scans, a CT scan, a cannular put in and over 25 blood tests. I wasnt allowed to eat or drink for 5 days. They said they thought it might be the malaria tablets I had been taking- doxycycline, but they couldnt confirm it and wrote down it was idiopathic on my discharge form. Ive been told I can try drinking again after 3 months but I 'm pretty terrified of it coming back- I cant handle that pain again! I think i will drink in the future if I can, just not binge drinking, which my doctor said should be fine.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago.

The first episode was in october 2002 (when I was 22), and the second only 8 weeks ago in june 2005. The first case was very severe as I did not know what was causing my abdominal pain, and the doctor I saw suggested I had a stomach virus that was circulating at the time. He gave me injections for the pain, but it continued into the next day and before long I began vomiting violently whenever drinking even small amounts of water. I was admitted to hospital once they discovered my amylase was up to 11,000, and was kept in over a week, the episode lasting 10 days in total. I had an ultrasound and an x-ray to search for gallstones, but none were found. I admit I used to be typical student and liked a drink, but never to constant excesses, and although I was honest with the consultant about how much I was drinking, they agreed it was nowhere near enough to cause pancreatitis, especially as I was only 22. I was advised to give up alcohol for 12 months â$ ``being young and stupid I only made it to 3 months, starting with the odd glass of wine, and I slowly resumed my normal alcohol consumption (around 20 units a week) without giving it too much thought. This continued until around a year ago, when I cut my drinking down by about half â$ ``I would have a few drinks during the week, and only have a big night out around once every couple of months. The second episode came 8 weeks ago, but I first thought the mild pain was due to a virus, as had suffered diaorrhea in the days leading up to it. I went to a & e to get my amylase checked as soon as the pain got worse and I knew what it was (you donâ$ t forget the pain of acute pancreatitis in a hurry!) . It came back as 4100, and again I was admitted. This time I was only in for 3 days, but was still in some pain when I was discharged. Again during my time in hospital I was given an ultrasound and x-ray but no cause was found. After this happened again I started to worry â$ ``my diet has never been unhealthy but I chose low fat options of everything and some organic where my budget would allow. I had no alcohol except one night out two weeks before my third episode, where I had around 10 units. I was called back for a ct scan 2 weeks later, but again nothing was found. The doctors were deciding what steps to take next, when I had the pain again. Then came the third time- I went straight to the hospital, and my amylase this time was only 1300. I was kept in for 5 days, during which yet another ultrasound and x-ray were done and nothing found and felt completely fine when discharged. I am now abstaining completely from alcohol, following a low fat, high carb (as suggested on other websites), completely organic diet, free from flavourings, colourings, preservatives and chemicals as far as possible, drink 3 litres of water, my only vice being 5 light slim cigarettes a day. I am tired a lot of the time, despite having at least 7 hours or more sleep a day. I am not, and have never been, on prescription drugs, and only take pain killers for headaches if absolutely necessary. Apart from the obvious, I am completely healthy. However I am medically overweight for my height, due to weight gained whilst on the contraceptive injection depo provera for a year and a half until april 2002, when I had a iud coil fitted. Plans are being made for an mri scan, but if nothing shows up I will probably be referred to a gastroenterologist for further tests. What I would like to know is, after 3 cases of acute pancreatitis before the age of 25: â$ cents am I likely to develop chronic pancreatitis or diabetes? â$ cents what tests should I request if they are not offered to me? â$ cents what other measures (apart from diet and alcohol avoidance) can I take to prevent this from recurring? I would really like to hear from anyone who has been in, or is in, a similar situation to myself, as every doctor and consultant I see is completely mystified and noone has a clue what is wrong with me. I just want my life back, without worrying about when I will be back in hospital next, and the horror stories about the results of regular attacks.######Hi! My daughter, 14, has been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Over the last 2 1/2 years she has undergone several test all within normal limits. Ultrasound- normal, ct scans, normal, and blood test, normal. However, she had hida scan performed of her gallbladder and this reveal dysfunction and had it removed (only part of the problem). She then underwent an ercp and this reveal sphincter of oddi dysfunction, very rare for children. Again, only part of the problem. The pancreas is the root of this evil. Do n't let them stop until you have an answer. If I had listened to the doctors, she would be the worst case of `nervous stomach/eating disorder ' known.######Hi, i was very interested to read your account- it sounds just like me, only I was 18 when it started. Like you, it took an age to get taken seriously, and they have now established that I have pancreas divisum (divided pancreas, you 're born with it, but it should n't be a cause on its own), no visible gallstones, no alcohol abuse (and you really have to work to get them to believe that when you 're in your 20s- they assume you 're out getting wasted every night!) . My situation now is that i 'm 32, and unfortunately I have continued to have about 2 attacks a year since 18. I am not diabetic, although there is a strong history of diabetes (1 and 2) in my family. I drink about two units a month, so barely anything, and I absolutely do n't think alcohol, or for that matter, food, have anything to do with triggering an attack. However, I do eat healthily, and exercise regularly. I 'd do this anyway- i 've always exercised, and never smoked (the one thing you must do is give up smoking- it 's got a host of links to damaging the pancereas, and our pancreases do n't need any excuse! It will also prove to the docs that you are doing everything you can). I live in the uk, and am about to go to liverpool to visit the research team there who specilaize in familial pancreatitis. One thing I have just come across this morning is a study at the bandolier site in the uk, which links selenium ace with possibly preventing further attacks. As I say, i 've only just seen this, but selenuim's a good thing to take anyway, and it 's worth a try! Let me know how you get on. It 's a tough disease, but the main things are getting the doctors to take you seriously and as the lady in the second message said, be pushy. It took them five years to diagnose my pancreatitis- and all it takes is a simple blood test. It will not go away on its own, so get in there and demand some attention! Good luck clare######Wow, that must be very hard having it twice a year- but at least you know what it is and can get straight to hospital so hopefully your enzymes do n't have a chance to get too high. Has it done permanent damage having so many attacks? Talk about doctors not understanding, my employers were also not happy as they thought oh she has pancreatitis it must mean she drinks loads hence its her fault she needs time off work! So now i 'm mostly self employed I run the risk of not being paid for a few days but at least I can avoid the constant pointless meetings about how much sick time I have had off and what I plan to do about it...! I did n't know smoking damaged pancreas that much, of course as if I need another reason to give up, I know it is no good whatsoever, but I have been good recently and a pack of 20 now easily lasts me over a week. Its a step in the right direction anyway! Yeah I have heard about the selenium thing a while ago, maybe studies were done in usa first, but its found in brazil nuts so if you like them its one less vitamin tablet to take! Pls let me know how you get on in liverpool. I have just been to hosp in croydon (possibly the worst in the uk!) to get my results of my recent mri scan, and when I walked into the room the ``doctor '' asked me why I was there !! Said I just want the results of scan, he asked if I was in pain, I said no I just want the results of scan, to which he asked if I would like him to examine me! By this point I was losing the will to live... He said he did n't have the test results, went out of the room for 10 minutes, came back and said they did n't find anything. How much I can believe him, I do n't know! Useless is not the word...######That 's what worries me most, really- every attack does some damage to the pancreases, so how much more attacks will it take before it packs up and we end up in a whole new world of pain? So, i 'm trying most things at the moment to stave off another attack. One thing which I have n't seen anyone discuss is when in the day their attacks come. Mine always, absolutely without fail, starts first thing in the morning. I either wake up with the pain, or it developed within an hour. I do n't know why this is- maybe it 's because the pancreas has been inactive over night and is starting to creak into action? I 'd be really interested in whether other people get it at the same time of day. What I want to avoid is it degenrating into constant, chronic pancreatitis. My mum is type 1 diabetic, so I do n't want to go there either! Also, we 'd like to have kids in the next couple of years- no desperate rush, but I think I need to start working out the risks. Pregnancy puts an extra load on the pancreas. I can find lots about people who havce had pancreatitis for the first time whilst pregnant, but have n't read anything yet on women with acute or chronic pancreatitis who 've been planning a family. Can anyone advise me? I 'm not expecting it to be an easy process, but at the moment I really do n't know what the chances and risks are. Hopefully the guys in liverpool may be able to help me with that as well. Clare######Yes thats what i 'm worried about two, I thought having 3 attacks was pushing my luck! 3 to you must seem great in comparison. My first two attacks started the same as yours, about an hour after waking up. With the third though I did n't get any pain until about 2pm, and was n't sure it was pancreatitis but took myself to hosp anyway due to history and amylase high at 1300 but lowest they had ever been. I do n't have any children so can not advise i 'm afraid. Hope you get some replies from women who can help with that, but out of interest how much extra stress does it put on the pancreas?######Yeah, it would really help to hear from some other people. There must be women out there who have had acute pancreatitis and wanted to have kids. I do n't really know much about this, which is one of the reasons why I want to get up to liverpool and get some info, but I know that it will be more complicated then usual. Apparantly one of the causes of ap is carrying (alhtough not necessarily having symptoms of) the cyctic fibrosis gene. One in 20 people in the uk carry the gene, so they 're going to test me for it, if I do have it, it 's really important that my husband gets tested as well, and if we both have it, that 's a whole new discussion. Apart from that, I just have n't had nine months without ap since I was 18, so the chances of me getting through a pregnancy unscathed are slim, I think, at the moment. As I understand it, all women are more at risk of getting ap when they are pregnant. I am assuming that that means that you and I are particularly at risk, and I have been told by one doctor that ap in pregnancy `usually ' results in miscarriage. But, that 's one doctors opion, and he was n't a specialist, so other dcotors may regard that as alarmist, or spot on. I do n't know. I could really do with some answers !! C######hey I read your posts and couldnt help but comment. . I had my first pancreatic attack when I was only 11 after that had 9 episodes in the time span of 2 years. After the two years I havent gotten any episode thank God, but to this date doctors havent found the cause. I went to Georgetown hospital, miami childrens hospital, Jackson Memorial, Baptist Hospital, John Hopkins hospital, Mayo Clinic in Rochester and tons of other hospitals and nobody could discover the cause. Now I am 20 years and havent suffered from a pancreatic attack, when i turned 19 I decided to try alcohol and since nothing happened i started to drink moderatly of course and rarely, my mom was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and i have decided to stop drinking so i wont end up in the same situation. We had tests done to test our genes and hereditary pancreatitis was not the cause apparently. I am registered as an unknown cause of pancreatitis but I think its hereditary that is the only explanation. Just wanted to let you all know######I had my first attack of acute pancreatitis one night when i went to bed. I didnt think anything of it and just went to sleep. the pain went on for another day and I thought I had pulled something and on the 3rd day of the attack the pain started moving to my back. so I went to the er and they did an ultrasound and a ct scan which all came back normal. when they got my results back from my blood panel my lipase was 10 times higher then it should be and so was my amylase. so I was in the hospital for 11 days and was sent home on pain meds and a low fat diet. The pain felt like it was going away and then 2 weeks later i started having the pain again but this time it was worse and I had started vomiting. so i went back to the er and the doctor said there wasnt anything they could do for me there and that he wanted me to go out of town to a different hospital where they could give me the right treatment. I was at the new hospital for 9 days and they didnt find any signs of gallstones and sent me home. I had a follow up with this new doctor and he did some lab test and my lip and amy was 5 times higher then what they should have been but lower then what they were when i had my attack and he gave me some pain killers and sent me home. I have 3 more attacks since the first 2 and this is all in a year. What do I do next since these doctors dont seem to want to help me get to the bottom of this..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

Last year an allergist tested me for allergies and asthma, and both came up negative. The allergist diagnosed me with non-allergic rhinitis. I also developed a very nasty cough that never stopped. In desperation I tried a little experiment on myself; I took three different antihistamines and my cough magically disappeared. I went back to my family doctor with this info, and he put me on Symbicort which had the wonderful effect of almost completely dispelling my cough without knocking me out. My GP also told me that non-allergic rhinitis is frequently diagnosed when an allergist can not identify the responsible allergen, and implied that the Symbicort was for allergies. But I found out later that Symbicort is an asthma medication. It has been argued that because the Symbicort worked on my cough, my problem must be asthma related in some way. Here 's a list of my symptoms: Current: 1) Night-time postnasal drip that wakes me up 5 or 6 times a night choking on mucus 2) Scratchy throat that is steadily getting worse 3) Occasional cough Past: 1) Bronchitis (at least once a year) 2) Devilishly persistent cough 3) Sinus infections (at least once a year) Any thoughts?.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

What are other's experience with weaning off (or at least down on) symbicort? I have always been prone to prolonged cough after I get a cold. Before last year I had been treated once with Flovent for cough but had been fine for several years. I have allergies and take reactine and nasonex year round. Last year, I caught a cold during the worst of allergy season and ended up with a terrible cough. It was worse at night and would get so bad I would throw up. I 've had this cough before and it is usually triggered by a viral illness. The cough was really harsh and would not settle so I convinced an after hours doc to start me on Flovent (which he was n't convinced I needed). Usually when I get a cough it will last for weeks, but once it settles I wo n't have problems for a long time. After a month on Flovent my symptoms improved but I was still using ventolin almost daily. My doctor then put me on symbicort 200/6 2 puffs twice daily. I had PFTs done once my symptoms settled and they were normal. I have n't had a methacholine challenge so do n't know for sure that this is asthma. My problem is that I ca n't wean myself off the symbicort. I 've tried going to one puff twice daily but always start coughing again. I 'm surprised I ca n't get off the inhalers a I have always been fine between episodes before. I do n't know if I just got used to feeling a bit tight and now that I know what it 's like to not have the feeling I have no tolerance for feeling tight. I did notice that exercise was easier after starting the inhaler and even noticed that I had longer breaths during yoga. What is the experience of others with CVA?######I do have cough variant asthma and am on Spiriva and symbycort. I was told I might never be off them!######I think I 'm struggling a bit with this. I went from not needing any inhalers to not being able to function without inhalers in one step. It is especially hard because my PFTs are normal so I feel like I should be fine without the symbicort. I sometimes think I 'm just being a hypochondriac and try to ignore the symptoms. Like today, I had a cough all day (to be honest I 've been coughing for a couple of weeks but was trying to ignore it) and felt a little tight but I ignored it until I got home. I did n't think ventolin would help but took it when I got home just to see and I 'm amazed what a difference it made. I 'm not even sure when I should use the rescue inhaler. Do people use it for any symptoms or only when the symptoms start to interfere with life? I 'm starting to think I should go back to my doctor to ask about this.######The rescue inhaler should be used only when you need quick help with your breathing or congestion. The main reason for taking things like symicort and the like is so that you do n't have to depend on your rescue inhaler. You should n't be using your rescue inhaler as a routine. Also, the weed and grass pollen count has been nuts, especially here in the Midwest. This pollen is my main asthma trigger. You may find your cough getting better now that the pollen is lower. When you see a pulmonologist they will set you up with an ``plan '' to help with the asthma attacks. Asthma is something you may never get rid of, so do n't ignore breathing and coughing problems. I feel much better now that I take daily medications to help. I almost never use my albuterol. Good luck to you and know that there are many of us out here with the same problems.######Thanks. Another question. When do people use their rescue inhalers. Since I do n't wheeze I do n't have a clear sense of whether there is a tolerable level of symptoms that do n't need a rescue inhaler? For example coughing occasionally through the day. Right now my symptoms seem to be ramping up a bit but are still mild. I feel a little short of breath walking but it settles when I stop. As well I cough frequently but not uncontrollably through the day and do n't have nighttime symptoms. I am taking my symbicort but do n't really use the ventolin. Do others use their rescue inhaler for mild CVA symptoms?######Your pulmonologist will go over this in some detail. I use mine when I feel like I have something stuck in my throat that I ca n't cough up. I 've never had a shortness of breath problem so you would have to get advice from someone else. CVA can vary from having a tickle in your throat that wont go away to feeling like you have something in your throat that you ca n't cough out. I also have considerable hoarseness when I have an attack. The rescue inhaler also helps to break up the heavy mucous in my throat besides helping breathing.######I also have cough variant asthma. Sometimes my coughing has caused me to black out briefly. The symbicort has made me much less sensitive to my triggers. Colds, smoke, fragrances and extreme heat or cold weather can set me off.######Obviously I 'm still trying to get a handle on this. At times I do n't feel like I really have asthma because I do n't have the traditional symptoms. This has lead to me ignoring changes in my cough. I 've had increasing cough over the last few weeks but did n't think too much of it. Today however I noticed my chest felt different, kind of like my lungs vibrating (I do n't know how else to describe it). I have n't felt this way since I started symbicort. I decided to be more liberal with the ventolin and could n't believe how much mucus I started to cough up. I 'm realizing I 'm going to have to pay more attention to my symptoms to avoid a real flare. Unfortunately I ca n't get into my doctor this week (I 'm out of town for the next few days) but will be trying to get in next week. I 'm hoping this will settle down soon..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I do n't have asthma attacks very often. Most of the time, the inhaler just sits in my purse unused for months on end. But when I get sick, my lungs kick up a fuss and I get asthma for the next few weeks. It 's as simple as that. I 've had enough years to know it. But I tend not to notice it until I get into the doctor's office and he listens to my lungs and reminds me to use my ventolin 3 or 4 times a day, at the same time as he hands me my antibiotic prescription. If I take a deep breath in and exhale sharply, I can easily tell if I 'm wheezing or not (that 's how I decide if I need to take my puffer, and if I need one puff or two), but he can pick it every time when I have n't got a clue. I went in to the doctor this week with a respiratory thing that had plunked itself directly into my lungs and had me coughing non-stop for 24 hours. It had n't remotely occurred to me that I was having asthma until he started talking about a stronger inhaler. I 've never needed anything other than ventolin in my life, but I 'm on symbicort for the next two weeks.######Sounds like you need to be on a daily med- not just a rescue inhaler. Give the symbicort a try. Maybe you need a pulmonologist to determine your severity and correct med. Symbicort is a dual med and you may be able to get by on a minimum dose of a single med. I 'd investigate it.######I 'm used to being extremely healthy, but I 've had a very bad year for infections. I 've had four antibiotics this year and never really gotten over one germ for more than a few days before the next appears, and this time he went straight to the strong stuff. I think he was over-reacting because I 'm getting over it a lot more quickly than I 'd expect if I was really `that sick ', but who knows. If it can keep me from getting sick again, great! I 've never seen a specialist for asthma. For that matter I 've never had a test for it or anything else either. I grew up in Australia and so many kids are asthmatic that they 'll hand you a prescription if you say you were wheezing. I held out until I was in college and had my lungs close up almost entirely while I was walking past a perfume store. Only one question about the symbicort- it seems to make me cough a lot more after I 've taken it, so I have to follow it up in pretty short order with my ventolin. Is this expected?######I 've never been on a dual med so I ca n't say. Others have reported that though so perhaps. Or maybe you need a spacer... do you use one?######I just got a spacer for my ventolin. I love it! I did n't think it would work for the symbicort though. What 's the difference between a `single ' med and a `dual ' med? I just took what the doc gave me. It 's apparantly not doing anything yet, but I know it takes time to kick in.######I take Symbicort with spacer. Works fine. Dual med means that Symbicort has two ingredients, fomoterol and a steroid. Fomoterol is a longer-acting version of the stuff that 's in your rescue inhaler. The steroid reduces inflammation in the lungs, but it takes a week or two to start working. Everyone with frequent asthma symptoms should be on a steroid inhaler, they make an enormous difference in preventing attacks. Over time, they can prevent the disease from getting worse. The Fomoterol is a good medicine for someone in a flareup, but it has more side effects than the steroid (same side effects as your rescue inhaler, in fact) so you do n't want to be on it 365 days a year unless your asthma is bad enough that it 's necessary.######I agree with JaneWhite1. Use the spacer with both so that you know you are getting the right dosage. It can take several weeks for the daily med to produce results. I am on a single med, Flovent, as my asthma is very mild and I do n't need the added benefits of the brochial dialator. It seems that many docs, esp general docs, start their patients off on a dual med like symbicort or Advair and evventually put them on a single med like FLovent. My doc started me on Flovent but 4 puffs a day. I 'm now on just one as it got my asthma under control and we reduced the number of puffs till I was down to one and it worked. So, jsut another reason to see a pulmo for a good dx and treatment plan.######Hi I recognize what you 're describing. I start feeling tired and it can take a while to realize I 'm short of breath. It could be seasonal (pollen?) but what I am told is that if I have to keep taking my inhaler then I need to increase the daily dose of inhaled steroids. What I 've realized after years is that it 's easier to control asthma if you react quickly (say with a small dose of inhaled steroids) than to let it go on and hope for the best. Your lungs can get inflamed the way your nose does when you have a cold and it can take a wee while for them to settle again. Your doctor should be able to help because everyone is different and it 's best to get expert advice. I would also recommend Asthma UK website..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

Some background info... for years I have had some discomfert at times in my chest, allergy wise, I was told I 'm allergic to the basics, mold, dust, pollen. But I also have a deviated septum which messes up my sinuses. For years I was on various treatments for the sinsus, and the nasal allergies, but I never really felt too much relieve so I just gave it all up. However, now that I 've had the lung function test, my doctor said it showed ``very little asthma, nothing to really worry about ''. Well, I did n't want to go in for an office visit for a ``consultation '' so I asked if I could talk to the doc over the phone. The office called me back and said, the doc would like me to start on Symbicort and go see him in about 2 months. I was kind of shocked because I 've read that symbicort is used for severe cases, and someone told me it 's known to be ``heavy duty '' meds. Then I went to pick up my presciption, along with my Mom's for Symbicort as well (she has COPD). , and my dosage is higher than hers. Why is he putting me on such strong stuff if my asthma is so ``little ''? Also, I 'm having an issue with now that I know I have it, I FEEL it more. Things I used to just pass off as nasal drip, when I get that ithcy throat dry cough thing, I 'm wondering if that 's actually an asthma attack, and it 's freaking me out, quite honestly. Anyway, I 'm going to start the Symbicort tonight, I 've been putting it off because I wanted more info, but I have to trust the doc's orders, right?######I do n't know what your asthma symptoms are, but it does seem a little odd to me that you 'd be started on a high dose of Symbicort right away. I also use a high dose of Symbicort, but that 's not what I started with. Each doctor has his or her own way of doing things, but generally they start with less medication then go to more medication until your asthma is under control. Here 's the deal with me... a big problem for me is nocturnal asthma. Albuterol did n't work because it does n't last very long and I was waking up several times a night to use it. So I was started on a low dose of Symbicort. I was still having some nighttime issues, though not as severe, and some problems during the day/evening so I was given the high dose, which is good. The long-acting bronchodilator in Symbicort lasts a long time so I get some good zzzzz's Sometimes I use albuterol, but it 's not too bad. As far as noticing your symptoms more... if you feel like crap 24/7/365, then you suddenly do n't... you take note of the times when you feel like crap again. It can be disturbing at first, but you 'll learn what your ``triggers '' are, that is, what things cause you to cough, get short of breath, etc.. In that way, you 'll know to avoid those things so you 'll feel better more often. It 's very helpful to learn about asthma/allergies. After I was allergy tested I got a short allergy education session and some good reference material. Also, my doctor/nurse has taught me a lot about asthma. The more you know the better off you are because things do n't seem so mysterious and random. I hope something I said has been useful. You should really talk to your doctor for questions about your medication, as he 's the best resource for advice. Good luck.######You are very correct, Ahhchoo, that each doctor has their own system. Mine starts you on a higher dose or more puffs and then reduces it as the asthma gets under control... trying to get to the lowest possible with good control. I started at 4 puffs of Flovent per day and am at 1 per day now. Ca n't really get much lower than that! So I can see where he would have her on the symbicort for 2 months and then come back for an evaluation. The OP should talk with the doctor then about adjusting the medication if all has gone well.######Thank you both for the helpful replies! As of last night, I took my first prescribed two puffs of the symbicort. The instructions say 2 puffs every 12 hours, and it 's a one time only, no refill prescription. So, I assume what his plan is to see how that makes me feel and he will go from there. Unfortunately I did not remember to bring it with me today, so I ca n't do my 2nd puffs until tonight, which will be a 24 hour period, I hope that does n't screw up any progress, but my assumption is it 's just a matter of lengthining the amounts. I plan to follow it as directed, once I can remember to bring it with me In regards to taking note of when I do and do n't feel like crap, to know my triggers... I used to try and do that too back in the day. However, I then start to become TOO aware of things, and I 've been called a ``hypo, worrier, making things up '' type too many times to want to go down that road. For example, I can see myself hanging with friends or family, having a bit of a cough, and then saying, hmmm I think it could be this that 's making me cough, since I just had it now and I started to cough, perhaps that 's a trigger. They will (and have) told me that i 'm being overly paranoid, hypo, etc.. Granted, I know I should n't care about what others say/think, but I have noticed that I have those tendancies to become TOO aware of things, and worry about them, etc.. But I will give it a try, and keep it to myself, perhaps, and just try to take note what affects me. Thanks again, and best of luck with both of your treatments, hope you are both feeling well more than most of the time######OK just another follow up here. I 've taken the Symbicort once a day for a few days now (I admit I did miss a few due to the holiday). I do n't necessarily feel an improvement, since I 'm not really sure what my symptoms really are or are n't. Also, I kind of feel like as SOON as I take it, I feel slightly tight in my chest area. But I suspect it could just be my nerves or anxiousness about taking the medicine. The same thing would happen with the Albuterol whenever I took it, but then it would eventually pass and I would feel fine. I hate being paranoid about this stuff, and I try to tell myself it 's not bad for me as millions of people take stuff and are fine. So, how do I know if I 'm really reacting to the med or if it 's just in my head?######You may just be stressing over it. Or it could be the bronchial dialator that is combined with the steroid in Symbicort (similar to albuterol and therefore maybe a similar reaction).######Hmm, ok I 'm gon na give it a few more tries and just mention it when I go see the doc. It 's not anything at all unbearable. And it 's kind of how I feel at any given time, really. Sometimes when I take a sigh, it does n't feel like a good enough deep breath, and other times, it does. I ca n't ever explain it except that sometimes you take a deep breath and you feel it sort of release inside, but other times it does n't. I do n't know if that 's part of the asthma, or if I just pay attention to my deep breaths too much. But, anyway, as I said, I 'll just suck it up and continue to take my meds like a good girl, and talk to the doc in a few weeks. Thanks again !!######You could try using a peak flow meter. In that way you could objectively demonstrate to yourself whether your chest tightness is actually less airflow in yor lungs or anxiety. Less airflow in your lungs... drop in peak flow after Symbicort or albuterol. Anxiety... no peak flow change. That might settle your mind a bit. It would also help your doctor to help decide your treatment if you 're having some kind of reaction to bronchodilators. I actually like Symbicort and I react well to albuterol. I 've never had anxieties about using either because I 've always had very positive results from both. If I miss a dose of my Symbicort or even squirt one of my puffs totally on my tongue (like I did today), I end up sorta hacking later in the afternoon and finally have to use albuterol in the evening. Suckage. Good luck. I hope it all works out for you.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I posted about the side effects of the nebulized albuterol yesterday, and thanks for the response-- today I 've used it three times, and have n't had too much trouble with side effects. My asthma just sort of appeared several weeks ago. Not gradually, just one day I started coughing and the next I was having coughing fits and chest pains. Since then, it 's getting much, much worse. I 've had several bad asthma attacks since it first started. I 've got an at-home nebulizer now, and I 've had to use it three times today. About an hour ago, I had a really bad scare. The worst asthma attack yet. I was breathing heavy and coughing for a few minutes, and then I just could n't breathe. I started getting dizzy, my chest and ribs were killing me, and I felt like I needed to cough but I just did n't have the breath. I tried walking and I nearly passed out-- everything was fuzzy and my vision kept getting black around the edges. All I could do was hunch over and try to get some air. My mom and her friend got me to sit down near the air conditioner, and when I tried to ask my mom to get the nebulizer, I could n't even talk. Every time I tried, I was gasping for breath. I 've never been more scared in my life. All I could do was point and finally say ``nebulizer '' after several failed attempts. I had to get up and go get it, though I nearly collapsed when I stood back up. I felt a lot better after the nebulizer treatment, but it 's still not quite enough. I 'm not struggling to breathe, now, but it is VERY uncomfortable-- normal breaths hurt, coughing hurts, I 'm still dizzy from that episode earlier, and I feel like just moving in general is only going to exacerbate it. My question is this: what else is there to do? What else CAN I do? I 'm on symbicort day and night, the nebulizer treatments when I need them, and I 'm on prednisone right now to get rid of the inflammation. What 's the next step? Every doctor I 've seen has only gotten this far-- nebulizer treatment, prednisone, send me home. Is n't there anything further that can be done? It 's unbearable. I never thought asthma could be such torture.######I am so sorry you are struggling so much. I 've never had an attack as severe as you talked about but I can imagine how bad it must feel because my moderate attacks feel pretty bad to me. I wish I had some advice for you but I really do n't know what can be done when asthma is really severe. All I know is that if you have an attack and if after using your inhaler/nebulizer rescue medicine you still are struggling then you need to go to the ER right away. At least they can assess you better there and you are in the safety of the hospital if it worsens. I 'm probably stating the obvious here but call your doctor ASAP on Tuesday. Like if they open at 8 a.m. then call at 8:01 and keep calling until they get someone to talk to you.######Serious asthma attacks can be scary. They are nothing to play around with. Go to the ER if you have a serious attack and the meds are not working. When you get to the point that you ca n't talk, that is serious. That said, when I have asthma flare-ups that are n't taken care of with my maintainence items, I typically end up on a round or two of Prednisone. That is really the only thing that gets things back under control. (I am on Singulair, Advair 500/50 and Albuterol). I also carry an Epi-pen prescribed by my doctor for a serious asthma attack. It is to be used to give me time to get to an ER when the Albuterol does n't work. You should also work with your doctor or an asthma specialist to put an asthma plan in place. It will give you some direction on what action to take when you have asthma problems of different types. It would also be useful to determine what some of your asthma ``triggers '' are. Then, if possible, you can work to avoid them or make lifestyle changes. That is often easier said than done though.######I agree with the written plan. If you are n't seeing a pulmonologist or at least an asthma specialist, you need to find one. I also agree with finding out what your triggers are so you can manage them. Next, you may not be on the best meds for you. You may have to try several daily meds to find one that works best for you. Good luck!######This might be a little bit of a long shot as you have had the asthma a relatively short time. You mentioned you are taking Symbicort. It is a combination therapy which contains a steroid component to keep lung inflammation in check and a long lasting bronchodialator similar to the albuterol but lasts 12 hours. I had some problems with Advair which is a similar combo medicine from another company. Advair is generally a good drug. However in a small number of people (myself included) it can actually make asthma worse, especially with someone who often uses Albuterol (usual component in the nebulizer) as I did before every bike ride. I did n't have attacks nearly as bad as you but after 5 or 6 months I had trouble riding 15 miles flat when I could easily ride 50 miles with hills before. I would ask your doctor about this. Unfortunately many doctors refuse to acknowledge this. Mind does and I stopped taking Advair on my own. My very next bike ride without any medicine was much better although not quite as good when I first used the Advair when it worked well. I would suggest your doctor prescribe another steroid, without the long lasting bronchodialator and maybe add something like Singular which is a type of anti inflamitory drug that works in a different way. The goal is to keep inflammation in your lungs to a minimum where your triggers do n't create an asthma attack. I would also try to figure out what your triggers are and try to avoid them.######After re-reading your post the pregnizone should be enough to reduce the inflamation although adding an inhaled steroid might help which is what your doctor added with the Symbicort. This leads me even more to believe that may be the long lasting beta agonist in the Symbicort that is causing the problem. Since you are taking the pregnizone I would call your doctor to see if you can try stopping the Symbicort and add Pulmicort which has the same steroid component in Symbicort without the beta agonist. If my theory is correct you should know in a day or so as the long lasting beta agonist should wear off before 24 hours..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

It seemed that each season I 'd develop a nasty sinus infection, bronchitis or a devilishly persistent cough. Last fall it was a cough that was literally non-stop. My old doctor retired last year, so I went to a new one. The new one gave me some cough syrup, and told me I probably had allergies. So he sent me to an allergist. The allergist tested for 60 types of triggers, and all of them came up negative. He also tested for asthma, which came up negative as well. So he diagnosed me with ``non-allergic rhinitis '' and told me to rinse my sinuses out frequently, which I do now, and helps somewhat. However I kept coughing, and out of frustration tried a little experiment. I took three over the counter antihistimines (Benadryl, Zyrtec and Chlor-Trimeton) which promptly killed my cough (and also knocked me out for a few hours.) I went back to my general practitioner, and he put me on Xyzal and Symbicort. I 'm not sure about the Xyzal, but as soon as I started inhaling the Symbicort my cough died almost completely. The weird thing is that I was later told that Symbicort is an allergy medication. Fast forward to today... my problem has manifested this spring as post-nasal drip, and I would wake up five or six times a night choking on my own mucus. Since I 'm currently unemployed and uninsured, I cooked up my own solution. Right now I 'm rinsing my nose out and taking Mucinex, Benadryl, Chlorpheniramine, Phenylephrine and Zyrtec. It mostly works, but I still wake up a couple of times a night and am frequently tired from a poor night's sleep. I 've heard mixing antihistamines is not a good idea, but combining them seems to be the only way to knock out whatever I 've got. So the upshot of all this, is what do I really have? An allergy, asthma or ``non-allergic rhinitis ''? Is there any over the counter medication that would be better than mixing up three different anthishistamines?######Symbicort is an asthma/COPD medication. It 's very possible that you have asthma- esp since laying down seems to exacerbate the coughing- and that is a symptom of asthma. It could be a cough variant asthma or regular asthma. Without being tested by a pulmonologist or an asthma specialist, you wo n't be able to find out. That being said, I 'm not sure where to send you since it really does n't appear to be allergy related and we are in the midst of serious allergy season beginnings here. I owuld not continue to mix all those antihistamines. My doc (Jim Bonner in the asthma/allergy clinic at The Kirklin Clinic) allows me to take 10 mg zyrtec twice a day and one benedryl at bedtime if my allergies are really bothering me. But I would never exceed that dosage. Typically I take one zyrtec per day and the one benedryl at bedtime. The bedtime benedryl is to help me sleep (it 's the Pm in Tylenol PM) and the zyrtec in the winter is for my wintertime rhinitis. I only take zyrtec if needed in the summer. Hope this helps.######Thanks for the response. I know little about allergies and even less about asthma. Still, does n't the fact that the problem is seasonal and that antihistamines work point to an allergy rather than asthma? Do you think I should repost this to the asthma forum? Thanks for the pointer to the Kirklin clinic, but currently I 'm uninsured and do n't have the money for a consultation. So I need to figure this thing out on my own if possible.######You have vasomotor rhinitis, which is nonallergic rhinitis. Perfumes, smoke and the likes bother people with this. Wow !! You certainly took a chance when mixing all those meds !!!######It could be allergy induced asthma. There are lots of possibilities here but the fact the the Symbicort worked leads to think it 's at least partially asthma driven. The Symbicort would not work for just an allergic reaction. Maybe you 'll get insurance soon and can get a proper work up.######The previous posters are giving you some good advice. You might also consider whether or not you have reflux. I have had ``silent '' reflux for years. My only symptom when I am refluxing is a chronic cough. Lying down you do n't have gravity working for you and the reflux can get worse. Of course, I have a cough as my main symptom for my asthma and some PND. The trigger for the cough is n't always obvious. If you think it may be reflux, you could try Prilosec, Zantac or Gaviscon.######Thanks for all the replies. Unfortunately, I 'm now more confused than before. My GP told me that `non-allergic rhinitis ' was a diagnosis frequently given when the diagnostician ca n't identify the specific allergy. But Titchou seems to think that if Symbicort works, it 's likely to be asthma or at least allergy-induced asthma. I have considered the possiblity that GERD might be the source of the problem. I do sometimes experience reflux, but it either usually comes right up, or manifests as shortness of breath and heartburn. A can of soda and a little Pepto Bismol usually clears it right up. When I 've got the persistent cough, nothing except Symbicort is completely effective at getting rid of it. Plus the seasonal nature of the problem I think eliminates GERD as a cause. I think I 'll repost in the asthma forum and see what folks there say..######-Health Issues###-Allergies

Do you have a rescue inhaler (albuterol)? You did n't mention that.######It may take a couple weeks for those medications to take full effect, or you may be on too low a dose of the Symbicort. Also, it could just be a nasty fall pollen season. Does it help if you avoid outdoors? Have you tried other antihistamines? Definitely, let the doctor know how you are feeling!######im not sure if it helps if i avoid outdoors. i really have n't been outside for more than 20 mins tops since August but i do go to school. i just came from the dr. she changed me from symbicort to alvesco n she said maybe flovent next time i go bk n a month. but yes i have a couple rescue inhalers. albuterol in the light blue and dark blue container and albuterol with the red body. ``proair ''. she said i should start taking pepcid or prilosec daily n that might help me breathe. i 've also heard sum 1 talk about muscle relaxers but im not sure. i havent took benedryl n a couple of weeks.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I was diagnosed with the disease in my early twenties when I had repetitive bouts of cold, cough followed by wheezing. No amount of medication has helped me so far to get rid of this problem. Asthma attacks keep recurring.######IT seems that you are using alot of antibiotic in your childhood that is refected to you now i advice you to do for specailzed doctor to cheek you..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Asthma

Every morning I wake up congested with tightness in my chest. I went to the ER last Wednesday because my albuterol (salbutamol) inhaler did n't work very well at all. I was given a breathing treatment in the ER and the ER doctor prescribed symbicort. I also have a cold/flu. I use the two puffs of symbicort in the morning and two in the evening. Some days I only have to use my albuterol a couple of times. Since contracting this cold/flu I 've had to use my albuterol taking four puffs in order to relive my chest tightness and congestion. Does it usually take symbicort a while to work or is it just the cold/flu making things worse? My peak flow readings have been down as well.######Symbicort may help somewhat immediately, but it will take a week or two to see the full benefit. And I 'm sure the cold is part of the reason you are out of control. Keep an eye on things, go back to the ER if you need to. Prednisone is also an option, if the flare does n't settle down soon. What kind of doctor do you usually see for your asthma? If you are n't on a daily controller medicine, maybe you should be. If you have n't seen a pulmonologist within the last year, I 'd consider it.######Thanks for the advice jane. Right now I only seen my family doctor. It 's not easy to see specialists around here but I can look into it. I use sabutamol (albuterol) as a rescue inhaler. Is that the same as a daily controller medicine?######No it is not. Advair, Symbicort, Flovent, etc are daily meds. The albuterol is a rescue med for when you have an attack or for premedicating before cardio. Seeing a pulmonologist should get you set up on an asthma action plan that will tell you what to do in case of a cold, the flu etc..######No, it is n't. Albuterol is something that you take when your asthma bothers you. It relieves symptoms fast, but it does n't prevent flares. Symbicort is one example of a controller medicine. You take it twice a day every day, whether you feel well or not. (Some people with milder asthma take it once a day.) It helps keep your asthma from acting up in the first place.######Ok, thanks for the replies. I do take symbicort two puffs in the morning and two in the evening. You 're right I really do need more of an action plan.######You may need a different med or to add another when you are sick. A pulmo can certainly help you sort this out.######Thanks Titchou. Hopefully I will be able to find a pulmonologist. I already have an endocrinologist and am going to see an allergist this month.######Hi In addition to the above comments re taking a `preventer ' and `reliever ' inhaler you should consider also using a spacer or volumatic chamber when using your inhalers. Problems taking medications are common for asthmatics when suffering from a cold, and colds often lead to a flare up of asthma, a spacer can be invaluable for relieving and managing symptoms. It is also easier to ensure whether inhaler working correctly, as you can see the `puff ' of medication being taking. Extremely simple and cheap to purchase- yet very effective.######The Allergist may be of some help to you as well. My Allergist provided me with an asthma action plan and prescribes maintenance asthma medications.######My pharmacist mentioned an aero chamber to me. I will look into a spacer as well. I never thought of the allergist as this will be my first visit with him. Thank you for your helpful comments.######The areochamber and spacer are the same. Different brand inhalers tend to use different spacers, as the mouth piece on inhalers can be slightly different in size. Since my asthma was correctly diagnosed, with the use of a preventer, reliever inhaler, a spacer, as well as recognizing the pattern of any deterioration- touch wood- asthma been very well maintained.######I really do need to get one of those. I know many of my asthma triggers but not all. Cigarette smoke really bothers me, paint fumes, cold air, sometimes cut grass. I 'm glad to hear that your asthma is well maintained aqua. I was n't diagnosed until I was a teen. As a child I was never able to run without getting out of breath and a pain in my side. I know it had to have been asthma then.######Like you I had undiagnosed asthma during childhood, and diagnosed late teens. I have had allergy testing, but nothing showed sufficiently to explain my attacks. I have learned my main triggers to be strong aerosols, certain perfumes, aftershave, sudden temperature changes, paint, smoke and laughing too much! But my worse attacks have always been when getting over a cold, which is very common for many asthma suffers. I always then have to use my spacer with the inhaler just so I can actually inhale my inhalers, without coughing. I am sure you will start feeling the benefits of your preventer inhaler within 7- 10 days, and increasing your ventolin, especially with the aid of a spacer, should provide some relief in the meantime. I always double the dose of both inhalers when ever I have a cold now, and it has been many years since I last attended hospital due to my Asthma. Hope things pick up for you soon.######I really do need to get that spacer because it sounds like it would really help me. Sometimes I feel the mist of the inhaler hitting the back of my throat but other times I feel nothing. This cold has really been doing a number on me. For some reason I do n't really cough that much with a cold. Instead I sneeze a lot. With this cold my ribs are really sore as well. When I have an asthma attack my chest gets really tight and I ca n't draw in a deep breath. Sometimes if I do cough it feels like my lungs are closing up, like suffocation. I never knew that was safe to double up the dose of my inhaler. I have to had to many times especially in the morning and during a bad attack. I wish that I had the breathing treatment like they did at the hospital. Thanks for all the advice and encouragement Aqua. I really appreciate it.######You could ask your doctor for a nebulizer like they used at the hospital. Many people use them. It might be good for when you have a cold or of ther upper respiratory issues. Another reason to see a pulmo!######A nebulizer sounds like a good idea.######Symbicort is a controller medicine for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma. It helps you breathe more freely.######Hello Trinity12, My asthma is also not so much under control but it is because my GERD. So it would be good idea to make sure if you have it or not.######A nebulizer is a great suggestion! I also used one during an ER visit and liked it so much that I asked my doctor for a prescription. My asthma gets very bad when I have a chest cold or bronchitis and it 's hard for me to get the medicine in my lungs. The nebulizer makes it much easier for me if I am sick or having a bad flare up. I have an albuterol solution for it. I actually keep a nebulizer at work and at home just in case I 'm caught with a bad attack at work.######I will definitely look into GERD as being a possible cause of my asthma flare up. Chest pain and congestion woke me up this morning. I took my symbicort and albuterol. I also used a vaposteam steam device which allows me to inhale hot steam mixed with vicks. All three of those things helped earlier on. Now however my chest congestion is becoming very bad. I 'm not due to take my symbicort for another 3 hours and I 've used double the dose of albuterol to no avail. The mucus seems to have become solid in my chest. Is there anything else I can do in order to thin the mucus? I do n't cough too often and when I took it just feels like I 'm suffocating and does n't bring up any mucus. Would an expectorant syprup help at all or hot soup?######An expectorant should help.######My albuterol finally has kicked in somewhat. I 'm going to try to drink more water to thin the mucus. I need to find an expectorant without a cough suppressant because I need to cough.######Sounds like I 'm in the same position you are. I thought I was getting much better quickly, but I woke up at 4 last night and when I tested myself to see how well I was breathing I kicked off an attack. Today the grunge in my chest seems to have started to solidify. I 'm coughing, but it 's not getting me anywhere. I 'm already on day 5 of levaquin and day 3 of Symbicort, so I should be covered. I 'm drinking tons of water today to try to thin things out and hoping... if I do n't feel better tomorrow I 'll call the doctor again.######I 'm sorry to hear you 're having such a tough time kajikit! I hope that you feel better soon. I found that water really did help thin things out for me. I still woke up feeling congested but not as bad as the day before. I still feel worn out and am still taking it easy. I sleep with my head raised which seems to help me not cough as much while sleeping. I 'm getting allergy testing done on Wednesday. I carry an epi pen because of a severe anaphylactic reaction to pecans and strawberries in the past.######I went to the allergist yesterday and found out what is causing my asthma flare up. I 'm allergic to various tree pollens, and molds. I am very severely allergic to cats, dogs, and dust mites. I have had an anaphylactic reaction to pecans in the past so I carry an epi pen. I am basically allergic to most tree nuts. Also I have a morphine allergy and an allergy to ivp (x-ray contrast) dye. The approaching summer season as well as poor air quality in my apartment (mold, poor ventilation, etc..) is the reason for my asthma flare up. I think that I did have a respiratory infection for a while.######Okay, good to get some answers. So, it sounds like you need to:- Get on strong antihistamines- Do what you can to improve your indoor air quality, such as buying a HEPA filter or window AC, or killing the mold with bleach or vinegar. - Consider allergy shots.######Thanks for the helpful advice jane. I 've been using extra strength non drowsy generic antihistamine. Are there stronger ones? We do have a window a/c that we use in the summer. We were able to kill some of the mold using hydrogen peroxide an water. I 'm going to keep an eye on the air quality forecast before I go out as well as pollen forecast. I 'm not sure about allergy shots because of the cost associated with them.######What is the name of the antihistamine- not the brand name but the drug name?######It 's 10mg of cetirizine hydrochloride. It lasts 24 hours.######That 's probably the best out there. You can take 2 per day- 12 hours apart. Try that for 3-4 days and see if it does n't help. Always pulls me out of an allergy attack.######Thanks for the suggestion Titchou.######Should both the doses of symbicort be spaced 12 hours apart or does it matter? I 've been taking two puffs in the morning but it 's not always at the same time. I have been taking the second dose between 5-6pm. Also the allergist gave me avamys (nasal steroid) but after taking my antihistamine, symbicort, and the spray my blood pressure became fairly elevated. (126/102) I could feel the pressure in my body and my head. I felt extremely light headed, dizzy and nauseous. I take tiazac (diltiazem) XC 240mg in the morning. Could it have been the combination of symbicort and the nasal spray that caused the blood pressure to go up? I really do need to get my family doctor to refer me to the asthma clinic at the local hospital.######It 's the bronchial dialator in the symbicort most likely. The level of steroid in the inhaler and the spray probably are n't enough to do it. Is the zyrtec- cetirizine- the ``d '' type? If so, go to the regular one without it as that will raise your bp also. You really need to gt the bottom number down- 102 is very dangerous. If you want, leave of the nasal spray and just go with the symbicort and the antihistamine. As for when to take, they should be 12 hours or so apart. But the closer the evening one is to bedtime is better. I 'm on one pull of flovent a day and I am to do it at bedtime. Hope this helps.######Thank you for all of your Titchou! I really appreciate it! The cetirizine hydrochloride is the regular one. I usually do n't go to bed until after midnight. Should I just take the last dose of symbicort an hour or two beforehand? As for my blood pressure I have been struggling with it for a long time. It took several different meds before I found the Tiazac XC. I take it to keep my heart rate regulated as well as my blood pressure. My heart used to race over a hundred just from walking a short distance and my blood pressure has been as high as 156/115.######Wow! You sure got a bad copy of someone's gene! Yes, do the symbicort and hour or so before bedtime. I usually take a bath around 9 and am in bed by 9:30 so I do mine when I 'm getting ready for bed. I get up at 5:30 and get dressed around 7 so that 's when I did my other puff when I was on twice per day.######Asthma and high blood pressure are n't the worst of my issues. Check out my post on the endocrine board. I guess I really do have bad genes health wise. I 'll follow your advice Titchou. I have n't been feeling too badly. A little coughing but my breathing is fine and also tired. I 'm always tired though.######I 'm doing my symbicort at 8.30 am and pm. I figured 12 hours apart would be the best, and I get up at about eight. I do n't seem to have much breathing trouble at night, mostly in the afternoons.######Kajikit. I have the exact same problem. Need to use my albuterol sometime in the afternoon like once at least... Especially if I 'm outdoors. The pollen season on the east coast has been ridiculous this year... A lot of my friends who are n't even allergic to pollen have developed pollen allergies this year...######Yes, Symbicort is not the ideal drug for someone with high blood pressure. Maybe after pollen season you can get switched to something without bronchiodilator. Also, if your rescue inhaler makes you dizzy, ask about Xopenex (levalbuterol). It 's a similar medicine that has fewer cardiovascular side effects. (Downside: it 's a lot more expensive, like$ 200-300 rather than$ 50 for regular albuterol)######The Symbicort and albuterol make me feel a little shaky at first but the effect goes away fairly quickly. I 've never checked my blood pressure after taking the symbicort. The only time that I checked it was after taking Symbicort, avamys, and albuterol one right after another. Thanks for the advice regarding Xopenex. I will look into it if need be..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

If you want to rule out diabetes, your doc should help you discover what is going on with you. Hope you can resolve this. Keep us posted. Rose######One doctor immediately said chronic pancreatitis, since my levels have been so high but have rollercoastered over the past couple years. But they ca n't find a cause or a cure for it. All catscans and MRI's have shown everything to be normanl, no blockages, stones, or inflammation.######Pancreatitis and diabetes can be related. If you have chronic pancreatitis, your pancreas is apparently comprimised and not functioning at it optimum level. Have you been referred to an endochronologist? When I was in hospital and not able to have anything by mouth for 10 days, on day 6, they introduced I.V. nutrition. This I.V. bag of `food ' was mostly sugar, with electrolytes and other vital supplements. I have not previously been diagnosed a diabetic, although I was borderline gestational diabetic with my first child and not with the second. The I.V. food bag, caused my blood sugars to be all over the place. I had insulin shots every day- multiple times a day- while the food bag was on the I.V. pole. They kept increasing the insulin in the I.V. food bag, but still needed to give me the shots- my body just was too busy trying to heal the pancreas to regulate blood sugars too. I believe that my insulin levels are not right yet and it has been a month that I 've been out of the hospital now. I need to see my doc/intern and get blood sugars checked as well. Just saw the gastro doc and still have a couple issues from that hospitilization episode yet to take care. I would make sure the pancreas is able to produce the insulin you need- You need to be proactive about it. Keep us posted Rose######I am not a medical professional but I do know from experience that yes diabetes and pancreatitis can be related. I have type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with chronic pancreatitis. They dont know if I was born with the chronic pancreatitis yet but looking back on my life long medical history it looks like I may have been. This is likely to be the reason why I am a double diabetic. So far lots of places I have read about online say that both chronic and acute pancreatits can lead to diabetes.######Thank you for all of the responses everyone. I have never been able to get a doctor to send me to an endocronologist, nor could I get one to accept me, because my blood sugar is always normal.

Spent a week in the hospital and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I was informed and told not to drink and being young and immature (24) I thought I could slip a beer or a drink in here and there which eventually led me back in the hospital for three days. Since then I stopped drinking for a while and one night at a graduation party had a few drinks which led to more drinks which led to pain but no hospital. I have now been sober since that day but I do have pain that comes here and there. When I went for a scan and bloodwork I saw my file and it said chronic pancreatitis. I am going to see a new doctor on the 21st. It seems like their is nothing much that can be done here but start eating better and NO DRINKING AT ALL. I only have my fathers insurance (which is a great insurance) until I am 26 which is 2 years from now. I really want to get the pancreas looked at to see how much damage I have done from drinking heavily since I was 19 years old. I was reading that I should maybe look into getting a contrast-enhanced pancreatic CT scan. Also what are thoughts on oxycodone and roxicet when you are diagnosed with pancreatitis? Sometimes I take these if I am in a little pain but read these might not be good for you if you have pancreatitis as well. What is the mortality rate from pancreatitis? How long do people normally live with this disease? Now that I have a little more informed I still get no definitive answers from doctors or gastros they all say the same thing which is eat healthy and do not drink. I still would like to know more. Thanks for any comments in advance. Brian######Okay I can only answer a few of your questions. I believe that pancreatitis is not cureable, it is manageable though, through diet and meds. As far as taking Oxycodone and Roxy's when your only in a little pain... thats way overdoing it. Heavy narcotics are dependance causing drugs if you take them for long periods of time. You also get used to them over time as your tolerance increases, so you have to take more and more to do the job. This is not a scenario you want to get into to control ``a little pain ''. These kinds of meds are meant for chronic conditions which cause major pain, we 're talking 8, 9, 10 on a scale of 1- 10, all day everyday. So you should really think about that. good luck, kat.######-Health Issues###-Pain Management

Had what was thought of to be my first diverticulitis attack. At the same time, I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I had two issues going on at once. The CT scan at ER stated that I had inflammation on portion of descending colon. The results stated Ischemic colitis could be reason, but my gastro thinks it may be due to diverticulitis, as I do have diverticulosis. (and because at my age of 44, didnt think I was a candidate of ischemic colitis). The ER never addressed the inflammation. I then had gallbladder surgery and then pain in intestines and I was put on Cipro and flagyll. Im going on my 8th day of meds, and I feel so horrible and tired, and have bad diarrhea. But whats really bugging me is Im getting pain on left side under rib, where I believe inflammation was. Its a nagging pain. Never occurred before attack. Just curious as to how long it takes to heal if it 's truly diverticulitis. Im assuming if I had any dangerous problems, Id be bleeding and keeled over. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!######Hi, You say you had pancreatitis in November, have you had it checked out with the pain you 're having anymore. I am 72 years old and found out I had chronic pancreatitis when I was 68. I realize now I had my first attack of acute pancreatitis before I was 18 years old and several more acute attacks through the years. My ER trips I was told I had Gastritis. I was also told I had gallbladder disease when I was 22 years old but it was quite a number of years more before I had my gallbladder removed. When my gallbladder was removed I still remained having pain in my right side. I also would have full-blown stomachaches, usually most of the evening after dinner. My MD had upper GIs and all the tests he thought of done and could n't find anything wrong so he labeled me as having right sided diverticulitis. So for years this is what I thought was wrong with me and I just lived with it Then when I was 68 I woke up one morning with a stomach ache straight in the middle of my stomach, one bad enough I could n't hardly sit still I was rocking back and forth. I went to the emergency room and this time they diagnosed me with acute pancreatitis and said I needed to see a doctor and get my pancreas checked, as my brother had died with pancreatic cancer. I live close to John Hopkins so that is where I got a doctor and went and they went down and checked my pancreas to make sure I did n't have cancer and I was told I had a disease pancreas. So now what I have is chronic pancreatitis due to having so many pancreatic attacks not knowing what they were. You say your pain is on the left side and my pain was on the right side but your pancreas is really in the middle in the back of your stomach so it makes me wonder. I would not go as far to say I would guess you have pancreatitis, but one never knows I guess and since you have had it it would be wise for you to watch out and not get into much more trouble with that like I have. I am wondering if it can hurt on the right side, can it not hurt on the left side also. They told me I had to really cut down on fats and dairy products and since I have done so I have way less pain and I 'm doing much better. I really wish you well and hope to hear what your problems turn out to be. Seeing that you have had pancreatitis it really crossed my mind how many years I have spent trying to find out what was causing all of my pain and also wanting to warn you to be careful and watch your pancreas close so you would not be into chronic pancreatitis like I have. Much luck to you and I hope you recover and feel better soon. Shirley######Wow, you have had quite a journey !! What I initially felt on Nov 26 was cramps, thought I had to go to bathroom, but I thought my intestines would explode. God awful. Then I suffered through next 24 hours before I went into ER on my own. They found I had pancreatitis. I had soreness in that area, but not severe pain like in the intestines. Its strange, I had two things going on at once. I am curious about the thickened bowel area of the descending colon. My uncle is dying from colon cancer and while I am young, I still worry. This is all an enigma. I went to the ER with intestinal pain and dx with pancreatitis. Not sure if the two are connected. Dont think they are. I believe the pancreatitis is gone. But I am sore from under my rib cage down. Could be the tail, who knows. I know its not my gallbladder, cause it 's gone! Im sorry you suffered for so long. What do you do for your disease? best wishes!######Hi there, I certainly hope you are feeling some better by now, it 's pretty miserable when you suffer with stomach pain so long. I can well understand why you 're so concerned, that C word is always at the bottom of our thoughts. I have no idea what diverticulitis feels like as I never apparently really had it. What I have to do with this chronic pancreatitis is watch my diet eat very little meat and dairy products and that is really cut my pain down. I will tell you the pain that it can cause can make you rollup and roll and I really have n't had an attack like a real real attack, to end up in the ICU, as many of persons have. I have read some horror stories of people with chronic pancreatitis on the Internet and it tells me from what I have had I certainly hope to never get there. Not long after I found out I have this I almost headed to the emergency room one night I was pretty doubled up in pain but I managed to get over the worst and go to bed. I 'll tell you, you watch every bite you put in your mouth after you feel the pain it can. cause. I have considered myself quite lucky since I 've known I 've had it from what I hear and have read about other people. Of course chronic pancreatitis can turn into cancer also so that is something you have to watch out for. My brother died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 52 and he had never been sick for a day in his life until he got that.How we never know what will happen next and when we get stomachaches it 's so hard to guess what 's going on in there. Please keep in touch so we can all know what 's going on with you. I just pray that you get it resolved soon. Good luck! Shirley.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

I have pancreas divisum, not discovered for 5yrs, so did n't know what the cause was at the time... Only a small percentage of people with pancreas divisum have chronic pancreatitis. I had attacks every second week with a four day stay in hospital to treat the pain, vomiting and rehydrate. In '08 I had temporary stents put in, they stay in for about a week and the they pass through (bowel). It stretches the alternate duct that the pancreas secretes from, letting the enzymes flow out. My duct was 2mm instead of about 7mm. After that procedure, which I 've got to get done every couple of years (2 so far) I have less pancreatic pain and far less attacks. Having said that, over the years I also have developed erosive gastritis, narcotic bowel syndrome and inability to eat much. And these problems together cause just as much hell! Also nocturnal epileptic seizures from a long term anti nausea med. Meds have caused these other issues to develop after long term use as Drs can only treat the symptoms. How long have you suffered from pancreatitis? I know what hell it can be and if I can be of help in any way or you want to chat, do not hesitate to ask..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

I 'm totally not the typical pancreatitis patient- female, thin, fit, good diet, minimal alcohol consumption, no visible gall bladder stones on ultrasound... I had the pancreatitis for 5 days before taking myself to hospital. In those 5 days I saw two different GPs. One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain. My husband died of Pancreatic Cancer 15 years ago. oh, and the depression is worse, of course. Wishing you luck Ann######Hang in there!######Oh gosh, Ann, that sounds terrible. I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment. Can that happen from acute pancreatitis or only chronic?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

My doctor prescribed omeprazole 40mg generic capsules that is covered by my insurance. It is made by Mylan and is delayed release. He wanted me to try it as a last resort before he calls my insurance company to fight for coverage of Nexium. Unfortunately, this omeprazole is not working well. I did n't notice anything until today (3rd day) and now I 'm having significant heartburn and reflux. I had tried 40mg Prilosec tablets (took 2 pills) before the doctor prescribed this omeprazole and I 'll have to say I think it worked better. I called the pharmacy to inquire and they said the omeprazole has no salts which apparently helps absorption in some? I 'm still not sure about this. If this is the case, why have two kinds? So I 'm thinking to switch to Prilosec tomorrow as I 'm becoming more and more miserable by the minute! Has anyone had different experiences between the two? Is omeprazole magnesium the formula closest to Nexium? Thanks for any help! This whole thing with no insurance coverage for Nexium has really been a bummer for me. Just shows how dependent I am on this medication. Thanks so much. Lori######I do n't know much about the comparison, but I do think you need to give the omeprazole more time. It took me 1-3 weeks to feel better and feel the effects of the medication. Once I quit cold turkey (horrible idea) and it took me 2 weeks back on the medication to feel the heartburn being suppressed. Then the omeprazole started to not work as well (I was on 1 20mg dosage per day), so my doctor told me to increase to 2 20mg pills per day. It took about a 1 and a half for me to feel the effects of that. So, give the omeprazole time.######If the OTC version of Prilosec works, then take that. Everyone's body processes things a little bit differently. That 's why it 's sometimes good to have slightly different medicines to treat the same thing. And, yes, the dependency thing is awful! Do n't you wish they 'd warned us?######I have taken what seems likes every PPI ever make like a merry go round use for able like a few years there it seem to lose some of it potencie anyways I have not found anything that works quite as well as Nexium I do not currently use because of the same issue of no insurance coverage. But you can buy omeprazole with magnesium over the conter in tablet and capsule form I currently use prescription omeprazole once day with prescription Radadine at night as needed. My GI doc says not everyone's body is diff so you have to see what works for you you might also ask about Dexilant which is the latest PPI's it was given to me by my regular doctor as a sample but I have not had a need to take it thank god! This stuff is supposed to be great but as like with anything it may or may not be covered by your insurance. GERD LUCK! Haha right this is what my GI do like to say geezs######Thank you everyone. I 've taken the prescription omeprazole from last Sunday to Tuesday. I then switched from that to Prilosec OTC. I thought it was working better but today I 've had my worst day. I 'm on day 5 now of no Nexium and I 'm concerned that this will get really bad in about 2 days. I know for a fact that Prevacid, Protonix, Dexilant do not work for me. Aciphex works very well but my tinnitus increases so loud that I struggle to sleep. I wish I could take it because my insurance covers it. I do not know if this Prilosec is going to work at all but I 'm praying with all my might that it just needs to build up. I do n't know whether to count the generic and the otc formula to say it is in my system now 5 days? I do n't understand why most of these drugs do not work well for me! The docs do not tell you about the dependence and I wish they did. I tried taking lower doses of PPI's in the past and none of them worked for my reflux/heartburn. I have a small hiatal hernia that should not cause me too much grief but it does! My doctor is not ready to call my insurance company and fight for Nexium coverage. I never thought I 'd be in this poistion where I feel like a drug addict!######I got here by typing ``omeprazole is killing me '' into my browser. I was taking Nexium but I recently changed insurance companies through work and they claim that Nexium is not a preventative medication so it is not covered. I took one Nexium a day and it was all I needed to halt my acid reflux, and I had no side effects that I was aware of. I have pretty much tried everything and nothing else works like Nexium. Sorry if this sounds like a commercial, but I do n't care. I got some samples but recently ran out and began taking Omeprazole. It is tearing me up. I have chronic pain and churning. I really do n't know what to do at this point. I could buy nexium for$ 200 a month, but that 's really not affordable. There are some who claim that Nexium is no different that Prilosec, but they do n't know what they are talking about. I would like to challenge the Insurance Company's claim that Nexium is indeed preventative. Does anyone have experience with that?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

Please let me know as I feel alone######Hi, sorry you are suffering and feel alone. What I can tell you is that I experienced pains in the jaw, cheeks, sternum, ribs, as well as fingers and feet as a result of taking PPIs (lansoprazole and omeprazole). So, I wonder how many of the symptoms you describe started after you started on 40mg omeprazole?

I was on 80 mg omeprazole for a few years (prior to a fundoplication operation). When I discussed this with a gastroenterologist friend and colleague, he said, in some cases 120mg have been prescribed (and shown to be safe)- which would be equivalnet to 240mg pantoprazole.

Your time is much appreciated######Hello, Welcome to ehealthforum Your symptoms are indicative of GERD or reflux disease.Since the symptoms are very severe you require a Endoscopy whioch would help in knowing if there is presence of any ulcer.Regarding the medication Nexium taken empty stomach has good response in reflux patients.You can discuss with your Physician regarding its use. Also I would advice you to get an Endoscopy done.Have healthy diet and avoid spicy, fatty food intake.Drink lots of water. Take care!######Thanks, I think the nexium 40mg really did help. I feel a lot better and I was just taking it for a few days. I was just wondering does taking domperidone help the absorption and effectiveness of omeprazole/nexium. As omeprazole is required to be taken on an empty stomach and domperidone helps empty the stomach. Because my appetite is very low but does domperidone help in regard to that? I now have to stay off the omep/nexium for two weeks because I am being tested for a bacteria which could be causing the reflux.######I have used a natural Amish remedy to deal with my acid reflux and heartburn for about a year now. There are n't any side effects, and it works in like two minutes. It might be a really great alternative as long as your doctor has no problems with it- which he should n't. It contains only raw and unfiltered apple cider vinegar, ginger juice and garlic juice. No preservatives or anything, but there is some sort of special blending process used to achieve its effectiveness. The only company that makes the remedy currently is Caleb Treeze Organic Farm, and you can pick up a bottle at their Stops Acid Reflux website..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Acid Reflux

A few years ago, I switched to the generic with no problems. About 3 months ago, my pharmacy changed the supplier for the Omeprazole, and I started having strange numbness and tingling, especially in my face, and lots of GERD issues. No one knows if it is related or not, but my doctor told me to start taking the OTC Prilosec. After 2 months, I am still having problems, and the GERD does not feel as well controlled as it used to feel. My doctor is now changing me to Protonix to see if that will help. I just wanted to see if anyone else is in my boat.######I took prilosec/omeprazole 20mg/day for around 10 years and it was a miracle drug (even though I believe it gave me IBS, but that 's another story). However about 6 mos. ago, I noticed my chronic heartburn symptoms coming back. I did n't notice any other side effects other than it seemd my GERD got worse and the pills were n't helping much anymore. Since then I 've tried max doses of Protonix, Prevacid, and now Dexilant and none of them seem to help much anymore. I fear I 've become immune or something even though my doctors keep telling me that people should not really develop a tolerance to the PPI class of drugs. Some people seem to do better by switching off from one to the other for a while, kind of a drug holiday. So far that has not worked that great for me but I 'm wishing you better luck.######There are a number of GI conditions that mimic classic heartburn and that the PPI's wo n't benefit. Perhaps you need a full work-up with a GI specialist, even if it means a second or third opinion.

All of which is corrected with iron IF this is due to a straight forward simple (IDA) iron deficiency anemia. FLFLOWERGIRL######thank you for your reply. I was wondering.######Flowergirl is right- iron will only help if you are iron deficient. It is possible to be anemia and not iron deficient- I am chronically anemic, but I was only diagnosed when I went to see the doctor because the iron tablets were upsetting my stomach. You need to check if your ferritin levels are low as well as your haemoglobin, and if they are then you will need to take iron. If it turns out you have chronic anemia, and not iron deficiency anemia, then make sure you find out what 's causing it- it is usually a symptom of another, more serious disease.######lynn82nj-- Were you first DX `ed with IDA to find out that it was not? How did they discover that it was not IDA? Curious. FLFLOWERGIRL######I 'm still a bit unsure in my case- it seem I had iron deficiency, and then at some point a few months later anemia, but unrelated? to the iron deficiency. The anemia was from a stomach inflammation from H. Pylori. What I do n't completely understand is that my ferritin plummeted from 66 to 10 in just a few weeks after the inflammation was cured- and I had to take iron tablets immediately after, although just a few weeks before there was no iron deficiency, and iron tablets had caused black stools. (!!) I do n't know if that helps your question flowergirl! I also would like to know what 10 on the ``anemia scale '' means too (I was 9 the month before)- does everyone else get dizzy after lifting groceries/problem solving/just going about their day, or wake up in the morning feeling like they 've just been exercising and ca n't get their breath? I 'm feeling worse than I was at 9 and I 'm wondering if I do n't have something else, or if I 'm just poorly adapted to the anemia? I read about a girl who was still working a customer service job at 8.5, but has anyone been able to continue with academic work on anemia? I 've had to quit my work because I was delivering such poor results. Would be great to know your experiences. .######lynn82nj-- Thanks for your post. I was curious about the type of chronic anemia that you had. I too would have chronic anemia if it were n't for my doc saying that I am married to iron supplements. Your ferritin dropped because you used up all your iron, as it was trying to keep up with the lowered Hgb levels which caused your anemia. There is an automatic mechanism that knows when to kick in whenever there is blood loss, and calls on the ferritin stores possibly depleting them depending on the demand. If I understood your story correctly. Iron and blood loss both are a cause of black stools, some irons turns stool green. That would scare me after an internal bleed taking iron and the stool becoming black. To answer your question, a 10 Hgb is borderline moderate to mild anemia and 9 is moderately anemia. I understand what you are saying about feeling worse. This happened to me when I was 8.5 in the beginning I did n't even know it and felt almost completely fine (like the girl in your story) until one day I almost blacked out once. I was working really hard physically. Then, as time went on and my blood levels were building I felt much worse. The only thing that I can think of that would cause this, is the fact that ~ for me ~ it went on for along time. My blood cells were severely small at 65 MVCV and not carrying enough oxygen needed for the heart to function properly. I had palps, tachycardia, high BP, and all sorts of fun things happen as a result. I think that because your anemia came on rather quickly that your body did n't have time to adjust, as mine went on for years probably. Your tolerance of anemia is proportional to the rate that it has developed. This is probably why your symptoms are more profound than someone with a slowly developing anemia like myself. I had to quit working, some people do. Everyone handles anemia differently; it really depends on what else your body has to deal with, as in any other underlying conditions. In a few months you will mostly likely recover from your anemia and then you will know if this is the cause of your problems. In the beginning it only took me 2 months to become non anemic. Good luck to you. Keep us posted. FLFLOWERGIRL######Thanks for your post Flowergirl- yes, I think you 've understood me correctly. That could definitely explain why I 'm feeling worse now than at any other point. What do you mean, you were non-anemic in 2 months ``in the beginning ''? How did it recurr, or why? Was it the same kind of anemia in both cases? Are you completely cured now? It sounds like your blood cells were really, really small. .######lynn82nj-- I was unable to tolerate iron and ended up with enteritis for 3 months (inflamed sm intestine and nausea), that was from taking ferris sulfate. I had to discontinue iron until healed and then resume low dose iron that was not enough and my blood dropped from 12.9 to 10.8 low with a 6 ferritin, until I had a procedure to stop blood loss. It was the same problem, instead of Iron Deficiency Anemia, it became Iron Resistant Deficiency Anemia. The anemia is resolved but I am trying to get the ferritin past 41. They say that I am having malabsorption due to long term use of PPI's for GERD. I have other symptoms probably unrelated to ferritin and anemia that came up during this period. FLFLOWERGIRL######it sounds like it must have been really frustrating- good luck and I hope that once your ferritin is ok again that that will be the end of your problems. I just got word back that my haemoglobin is now up to 11.6, just within normal range, just 4 weeks after the h. pylori being cured, and my iron and ferritin are slowly creeping up as well. so hopefully nothing more to worry about there you are right though, getting better is the hardest part- I 'm sure I was n't this weak before now! weird how the body adjusts to cope######I 'm glad that your numbers came up so quickly. Now that you are rid of the bacteria you should be fine. My mom had that happen 2 years ago with anemia and she has never had another problem with it. Best of luck to you too!

You are iron deficient (8 Ferritin), and therefore anemic. Good luck to you! FLFLOWERGIRL######Jane, I have hemolytic anemia, and when my hemoglobin goes below 11, I feel just awful, and my dr starts treatment for me. Be glad they caught this now, before you got any worse.

Single mom of three kids and trying to recover after this hysterectomy is enough to deal with- the anemia again just is a nightmare.######Have you been checked for celiac disease? It interferes with iron absorption and causes anemia. Treated with gluten restriction and once the bowel heals, iron is absorbed from food. Worth a check. Trying to raise 3 kids alone is exhausting enough without having anemia on top of it! I hope you get to the bottom of it and get blood count back up. Also, have you been checked for hemolytic anemia-a Coombs test. It is where you break down your own red cells by antibodies, then use up what iron you have excessively trying to make new ones. It is autoimmune. I would ask your hematologist about both of those conditions..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

I do n't know if you are female or not? As far as IDA iron deficiency anemia goes-- It can be caused by a couple rather common reasons. Either you are not taking enough in iron to support the amount that is lost OR you are having a malabsorption syndrome and there are several causes for this. If it is due to malabsorption you are usually low and/or deficient in other things as well, but not always. Do you know the reason for your anemia and lowered Hgb? Many times the answer is there, and it has to be fixed before you can get enough iron to stabilize your numbers. If it is from heavy periods, then this would need fixed or it can be a cycle happening over and over again. Keep us posted..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

I went to the doctor and my iron is up to 11. YEA !!! The problem is that even though my iron is up i feel more tired than i did when i was first diagnosed w/ anemia. Then my iron was 8. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? The doc is checkin ' my thyroid and i 'll get those results tomorrow but if its not that then he doesnt know. any ideas ?? Thanks y' all!######Have you asked your doctor to check your B12 level? This can cause symptoms of tiredness, memory loss, unable to focus on task, and several neurological symptoms as well.######He checked my B12 and it was ``normal '' the thyroid came back fine and accordin ' to the blood work everything is fine, but i know that somethin' is goin ' on inside me. Should i be worried? Do y' all think i should get a referral to another doctor? if so, what kind? Thanks y' all######Hi, I 'm sort of in the same situation... I have been diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, because my ferritin level is only a 2. My B12 levels are also normal, my thyroid is find too. My dr. told me to take iron supplements, which I 've been doing for about a month. I 've been through all of the gastrointestinal tests, like a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and small bowel x-ray series, and all these were normal. A biopsy was also taken, and I have no problem with iron absorption. I do n't know if you 've had all the gastro. testing done or not... you did n't mention that. Last, but not least, after all those awfully invasive tests, I was told to go to the gynocologist to see if there 's any problem there. My gynocologist did a vaginal ultrasound and found 4 fibroids. So, the gyn. thinks that heavy periods (I do n't think they 're that heavy) may be causing my anemia, and the fibroids can make it worse. I just started taking a low dose birth control pill (Allese) to see if that will lighten my periods & help the anemia. The fibroids ca n't be removed because it 's too risky. To answer your question whether or not you should go to another doctor, first of all, what type of doctor is the doctor that you 're currently going to? Does he/she want to do more testing, and/or send you to any type of specialist? Have you had the gastrointestinal tests all done? After the blood workups, I believe that 's the next step.######Robste, I 'm glad you were able to get your hemoglobin back up! That 's great! As for feeling more tired now then you did awhile ago, I 've had the same experience... there were times when my hemoglobin would be up a little and I would be feeling more tired then I was when it was lower... I 've also noticed others on this board have had similar experiences. I have n't been able to get a good explanation for this either... so my own personal theory on this is that your body has been working overtime to make more red blood cells, and that, in addition to being anemic, must be tiring. And, I 've heard that people can still feel tired and experience symptoms of anemia if their ferritin is low, but their hemoglobin is normal... Well that 's just my two cents, but let me know if you find out something more ``official ''! Oops, I wrote Robste above, but meant to say Annabella... it must be time to go to bed!######I have n't had any major test done, i 've just seen my PCP and he does n't seem to concerned with running more test to find the cause of my anemia. do y' all think it is time to get a refferal?######From everything I 've heard and read about iron-deficiency anemia, your doctor should n't just prescribe iron supplements and stop there, even if your hemoglobin goes up. Most of the time, the iron supplements will help bring your blood levels back to a normal range, but they may drop again if you stop taking them (since your doctor never found out what was causing the anemia). Have they checked your stool for occult bleeding? That 's usually one of the first things they do when someone is found to be anemic, or refer you to the gyn for further testing. I would talk this over again with your doctor... especially considering you started out at an 8... I would think he would want to find out the cause. Good luck!.######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

She is 85. We got her test results back on Wednesday and were told she is Anemic. I asked the GP is it iron deficency but she said no and it is n't B12 deficency either because Nans results are in the middle with both of these. She also said it isnt caused by folic acid deficency. So what type of Anemia does she have? She isnt bleeding from anywhere and does have kidney disease which can cause Anemia. But GP wants to re-test her in 3 months which personally I think is far too long. Nan fees very poorly with dizziness, ethargic and she keeps falling asleep. Hopefully someone here can hep. Thank you.######I can not help you, but just wanted to let you know that your Nan is really lucky to have you in her corner as her advocate. I think you should push for treat ment, if they have already ruled out the other anemias, why should she continue feeling poorly, when she could be working toward feeling better? I do get upset when the elders of our time, seem to get pushed aside, as if being older does n't deserve the best care possible. Please continue to be her voice, and insist they help her out. Once you start treatment for any anemia, it takes a long time to correct and to start feeling better. Good Luck!######Hi hun and thank you for your kind words and reply. I 've been right alongside my Nan since I was 16. I 've been her carer since then. I 'm going to give the GP a call tomorrow or go down there and get something done. I too get upset at the way the elderly are pushed aside just because they 're old. It 's disgusting. But thank you again. Does anyone else know what type of Anemia she may have? I got her some multivitamins earlier that contain Iron and hopefully this will help######Mystic, She could have anemia as a process of her kidney disease- I ca n't think of the word for it. I have a friend who is anemic due to chronic blood loss as a result of kidney problems. Some other tests they should run are a Coomb's test and a reticulyte test. The Coomb's test will make sure her body is n't making antibodies to her red cells- that would be Hemolytic Anemia. The reticulyte test (sometimes known as `retic ', tells how many immature blood cells are in circulation, which tells them how many cells are being destroyed and at what age)- that info will point them in the right direction and get them started on a treatment plan. Just how anemic is she? Best, Jill######_ mystictiger _, you said that the doctor said your nan's anemia is n't caused by an iron deficiency, so i 'm just wondering why you bought the multivitamins that contain iron. although multivitamins will probably help with something.######(QUOTE = childofGod777; 2943485 so i 'm just wondering why you bought the multivitamins that contain iron. although multivitamins will probably help with something. (/ QUOTE) That 's exactly why I bought them in the hope that they will do something and help with her various symptoms. Anything is worth a shot when the GP wont do anything. Japlopper- The GP did n't say how Anemic she was. I asked but they did n't tell me her blood test results and how many WBC and RBC she has. All she said was she is Anemic, it is n't severe Anemia due to blood loss but it is n't mild & its caused by her Kidney. GP also said its not iron or B12 deficency as her levels are in the middle for both of these but she is more Anemic than she was last time (2 months ago). I do n't understand because when she was Anemic 2 months ago she was given Iron tablets by the GP & this helped with her symptoms & it was mild Anemia back then- but now its worse & they do nothing. Just the usual re-test in 3 months. Nans results also showed abnormal Thyroid and this is also being re-checked in 3 months.######I recall reading the kidney disease has some relationship with lack of production of a hormone which makes red blood cells. This hormone is called eryrthropoietin. I have thyroid disease, which sometimes can effect this hormone too, but not in my case apparently. The consequence of decreased EPO (erythropoietin) is that one has fewer red blood cells, less delivery of oxygen to cells and body, less capacity for work, therefore fatigue. I presume the dr was looking at her hemoglobin, which should have been below range, to show anemia? Also, I would ask if the dr looked at serum ferritin values of your nan in making his determination that she also does not have a contributory nutritional iron deficiency anemia. It is the best measure of iron stores in the body. If it does turn out that it the common problem of diseased kidneys not producing enough EPO, there is a synthetic hormone to raise hemoglobin, however, I read about this that it has potential side effects, including stroke, (my father had a bad bleed and they were considereing it for his anemia), so you have to weigh the benefits against the negatives. Hope this helps. See if you can get some info or records to give you and your nan peace of mind.######Hi hun and thanks for your reply. I took Nan to GP yesterday and was told to give her Iron tablets and she 'll re-test her in 4-6 weeks. I have heard of that hormone but because the treatment has a risk of bleeding associated with it, I dont know if the Doc will do it for Nan because we all have a bleeding disorder. Yup GP was looking at her Hemoglobbin and everything in the full blood count range. GP has also made a appointment for Nan at the Asthma clinic because her Asthma has been playing up and she 's been given a new tablet for her Heart whereas her blood pressure med has been reduced because this can damage the Kidneys more apparently. Great thing is her BP is in the ``ideal/normal '' range so Nan is very happy about that. Something going right at least lol. Im sorry about your Dad hun.

One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain. My husband died of Pancreatic Cancer 15 years ago. oh, and the depression is worse, of course. Wishing you luck Ann######Hang in there!######Oh gosh, Ann, that sounds terrible. I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment. Can that happen from acute pancreatitis or only chronic?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

I have had very high lipase and amylase levels for quite some time, without any symptoms. All the testing and scans has led my dr's nowhere. I crave sugar all the time, sometimes I have drastic energy crashes before I even know I 'm hungry. Recently my vision has gotten blurry, sometimes it is so hard to see that it gives me bad headaches. I know nothing about diabetes. Should I be tested? Thank you for your help.######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or ther other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. Curious. Rose######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or the other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. If you want to rule out diabetes, your doc should help you discover what is going on with you. Hope you can resolve this. Keep us posted. Rose######One doctor immediately said chronic pancreatitis, since my levels have been so high but have rollercoastered over the past couple years. But they ca n't find a cause or a cure for it. All catscans and MRI's have shown everything to be normanl, no blockages, stones, or inflammation.######Pancreatitis and diabetes can be related. If you have chronic pancreatitis, your pancreas is apparently comprimised and not functioning at it optimum level. Have you been referred to an endochronologist? When I was in hospital and not able to have anything by mouth for 10 days, on day 6, they introduced I.V. nutrition. This I.V. bag of `food ' was mostly sugar, with electrolytes and other vital supplements. I have not previously been diagnosed a diabetic, although I was borderline gestational diabetic with my first child and not with the second. The I.V. food bag, caused my blood sugars to be all over the place. I had insulin shots every day- multiple times a day- while the food bag was on the I.V. pole. They kept increasing the insulin in the I.V. food bag, but still needed to give me the shots- my body just was too busy trying to heal the pancreas to regulate blood sugars too. I believe that my insulin levels are not right yet and it has been a month that I 've been out of the hospital now. I need to see my doc/intern and get blood sugars checked as well. Just saw the gastro doc and still have a couple issues from that hospitilization episode yet to take care. I would make sure the pancreas is able to produce the insulin you need- You need to be proactive about it. Keep us posted Rose######I am not a medical professional but I do know from experience that yes diabetes and pancreatitis can be related. I have type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with chronic pancreatitis. They dont know if I was born with the chronic pancreatitis yet but looking back on my life long medical history it looks like I may have been. This is likely to be the reason why I am a double diabetic. So far lots of places I have read about online say that both chronic and acute pancreatits can lead to diabetes.######Thank you for all of the responses everyone. I have never been able to get a doctor to send me to an endocronologist, nor could I get one to accept me, because my blood sugar is always normal. My amylase and lipase are always a mess, but I ca n't seem to find anyone who wants to do anything other than take out my gallbladder. =-LRB- I 've given up for now..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I had a Dx of LPR last January (2006), and have been taking Nexium + Prilosec OTC. I have a endoscopy scheduled for this Wednesday due to slight troubles with swallowing and constant mucus in the back of my throat that just won t go away. I have been having lower back problems for quite awhile (years), but recently have been experiencing mid-back pains. I have also recently been getting slight nausea off/on throughout the day. Nothing major whatsoever, but just that slight nauseating feeling in my belly. About 4 days ago, my stools have been getting lighter & lighter, almost to a tan color. Obviously this is of concern after reading about mid-back pains, light stool, nausea and losing weight being associated with pancreatic cancer. I may just be over-reacting here. My 1st logical thought is that my chances of getting pancreatic cancer at the age of only 50 is remote, especially having never smoked and almost never consume alcohol. 70% of those Dx d with pancreatic cancer are between 65-80 years old. However, I m guessing I should ask my doctor on Wednesday about these symptoms and see if I can get tested for pancreatic cancer, such as CBC bloodwork (including liver function, WBC, etc), stool test and CT scan. Are there other ailments associated with the pancreas that has these same symptoms? Does pancreatitis show these same symptoms? Thanks for any response.######Hi I have been having similar symptoms for 6 months. I am a 42 year old female. No nausea but I had chronic runs for 4 months have lost 10lbs and constant stomach and back pain. I have had all kinds of tests and worried about my pancreas. Everything has come back negative. I have had ultrasounds, full bloods, x rays, CT, small bowel series, etc.. If you find out anythng let me know. I was told it would show on the CT with contrast. I hope you get answers.######Hello I am experiencing some of the same symptoms. I have light stool and no appetite. I do not have jaundice and that is a positive sign, I hope. I am having a CT done this Friday in hopes of ruling out Pancreatic or Liver cancer. I am very uncomfortable with the possibility of either. Ish######There could be many causes for the symptoms you are experiencing! Although, I am 27 and female and have never smoked or drank at all. I now have chronic pancreatitis and I get many of the symptoms you spoke of. I came down with a severe case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis 3 years ago due to my triglycerides being way too high (over 2000). They diagnosed me by my amylase and lipase being elevated, but now that I have chronic pancreatitis my amylase and lipase no longer elevate during a ``flare-up '' so a normal blood test result for amylase and lipase are n't a definitive way to diagnose it. A CT scan will usually show it, but for me the defining test was an endoscopic ultrasound (that was how I got the chronic diagnosis). But the troubles malabsorption that comes with pancreatitis can cause the stools to become very light in color, increase, and can even be diarrhea.######Did yout CT show any abnormality with your pancreas? Thanks for the information.######I just had blood drawn today for the full CBC test. I 'm guessing if there 's a problem with the pancrease/ gall bladder/ liver = this should show something, right? what results should I be looking at particularly? Are these the ones that would show a problem in these areas......... > Bilirubin > AST/ ALT > Albumin > Lipid > Triglyceride > WBC > RBC If these come back OK, can I rule out pancrease problems? Thanks. Mark PS- I think I 'll discuss a CT scan with my GI Dr. tomorrow before my endoscopy.######the CT showed and still shows nothing, but we know for sure that I do have CP. To check for Acute pancreatitis they usually draw an amylase/lipase level. The triglyceride level is what was off for me and caused the whole thing. It was over 2000######Can I ask what are your symptoms? Do you have stomach pain and where and do you have it all the time or intermittantly? Thanks for your help.######I just got my bloodwork back, and here are the results for the ``pancreas related '' issues...... > Bilirubin = (0.2-1 .2) OK > AST = (10-35) OK > ALT = (9-60) OK > Albumin = (3.6-5 .1) OK > Cholesterol = (125-200) OK > Triglyceride = (< 150) OK > WBC = (3.8-10 .8) OK > RBC = (4.2-5 .80) LOW > Glucose = (65-99) HIGH Based on these, can I be fairly certain that the pancreas is not an issue here? I tried to explain to my DR that I have pain in my middle back, but she fluffed off ANY remote chance that it pancreas. Is elevated glucose any indication of pancreas problem, or is just because I 'm chubby? LOL! Thanks for any opinions..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Pancreatic & Liver

Anyway, this was my second bout of pancreatitis-- my first one was in 1998 and led to me having my gallbladder removed a few months later. I do n't drink. I do n't have a gallbladder. People do n't know why I had this bout of pancreatitis, so I got sent to a GI specialist who suggested I have an MRCP (an MRI version of an ERCP). This turned out completely normal. Meanwhile, my serum lipase is elevated (700 instead of being < 250 or so) and so I am on lipram/pancreas for the next few months. At the same time as all this, I went to another doc for another reason and she thougth my thyroid was enlarged. So this led to more tests, one of which triggered the thought that maybe all this is linked to an auto-immune disease. Does anyone have any experience like this? Any words of advice? Thanks. lemonhead######Hi Lemon, I am sorry about your problems but I have only known one person in my life to have preaceatitis. Has a Doctor determined why yours is putting out so much lipase? I think that is rather a rear problem !!! Harry######I have Lupus, for which I was given prescription drugs, which I believe caused me to end up with chronic pancreatitis and diabetes. I hope your doctors can find the problem and get it taken care of for you.######What were your major symptoms with Pancreatitis besides the pain? Where was your pain? The doctor thinks I could possibly have pancreatitis as well, I dont drink, smoke either and I supposedly dont have gallbladder problems so it is a real puzzler to me and her but who knows. Was just wondering to get a better idea of the symptoms. Gl trying to find out what is up.######My pancreatitis was mostly manfested in mid-epigastric pain (like just below my sternum) which could only be slightly relieved by doubling over and slouching. Have you had your serium lipase and amylase levels checked? Those are usually important in determining a Dx of pancreatitis. . hope this helps. lemon######My lipase level was normal but the amylase was elevate to 123, normal range is 21-101. I heard that ppl with pancreatitis usually have higher leveles of amylase than that but who knows. I have yet to get the urinalysis test results back which was also testing for amylase. How high was yurs? well i havta get to class, ttyl! ~ Shanny######When I was having my acute pancreatitis attack last Dec (which put me in hosp for 6 days), my lipase was 38,000 and my amylase was 1400. Now my lipase is still elevated but my amylase is back to normal. I have had loads of tests though since I last posted and they found I have a tumor in my pancreas and a growth in my duodenum. I expect I 'll have to have those out at some point. Could explain my elevated lipase though. Good luck on your quest for an answer. lemon######Wow, lemon i will be praying for you health! That is so not cool but God is a divine healer, no? Good luck to you and thanks for your help. I just got my urinalysis test results back and the amylase was back to normal so guess it was just a weird occurance or somethng, maybe somebody tested it wrong.

The first episode was in october 2002 (when I was 22), and the second only 8 weeks ago in june 2005. The first case was very severe as I did not know what was causing my abdominal pain, and the doctor I saw suggested I had a stomach virus that was circulating at the time. He gave me injections for the pain, but it continued into the next day and before long I began vomiting violently whenever drinking even small amounts of water. I was admitted to hospital once they discovered my amylase was up to 11,000, and was kept in over a week, the episode lasting 10 days in total. I had an ultrasound and an x-ray to search for gallstones, but none were found. I admit I used to be typical student and liked a drink, but never to constant excesses, and although I was honest with the consultant about how much I was drinking, they agreed it was nowhere near enough to cause pancreatitis, especially as I was only 22. I was advised to give up alcohol for 12 months â$ ``being young and stupid I only made it to 3 months, starting with the odd glass of wine, and I slowly resumed my normal alcohol consumption (around 20 units a week) without giving it too much thought. This continued until around a year ago, when I cut my drinking down by about half â$ ``I would have a few drinks during the week, and only have a big night out around once every couple of months. The second episode came 8 weeks ago, but I first thought the mild pain was due to a virus, as had suffered diaorrhea in the days leading up to it. I went to a & e to get my amylase checked as soon as the pain got worse and I knew what it was (you donâ$ t forget the pain of acute pancreatitis in a hurry!) . It came back as 4100, and again I was admitted. This time I was only in for 3 days, but was still in some pain when I was discharged. Again during my time in hospital I was given an ultrasound and x-ray but no cause was found. After this happened again I started to worry â$ ``my diet has never been unhealthy but I chose low fat options of everything and some organic where my budget would allow. I had no alcohol except one night out two weeks before my third episode, where I had around 10 units. I was called back for a ct scan 2 weeks later, but again nothing was found. The doctors were deciding what steps to take next, when I had the pain again. Then came the third time- I went straight to the hospital, and my amylase this time was only 1300. I was kept in for 5 days, during which yet another ultrasound and x-ray were done and nothing found and felt completely fine when discharged. I am now abstaining completely from alcohol, following a low fat, high carb (as suggested on other websites), completely organic diet, free from flavourings, colourings, preservatives and chemicals as far as possible, drink 3 litres of water, my only vice being 5 light slim cigarettes a day. I am tired a lot of the time, despite having at least 7 hours or more sleep a day. I am not, and have never been, on prescription drugs, and only take pain killers for headaches if absolutely necessary. Apart from the obvious, I am completely healthy. However I am medically overweight for my height, due to weight gained whilst on the contraceptive injection depo provera for a year and a half until april 2002, when I had a iud coil fitted. Plans are being made for an mri scan, but if nothing shows up I will probably be referred to a gastroenterologist for further tests. What I would like to know is, after 3 cases of acute pancreatitis before the age of 25: â$ cents am I likely to develop chronic pancreatitis or diabetes? â$ cents what tests should I request if they are not offered to me? â$ cents what other measures (apart from diet and alcohol avoidance) can I take to prevent this from recurring? I would really like to hear from anyone who has been in, or is in, a similar situation to myself, as every doctor and consultant I see is completely mystified and noone has a clue what is wrong with me. I just want my life back, without worrying about when I will be back in hospital next, and the horror stories about the results of regular attacks.######Hi! My daughter, 14, has been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Over the last 2 1/2 years she has undergone several test all within normal limits. Ultrasound- normal, ct scans, normal, and blood test, normal. However, she had hida scan performed of her gallbladder and this reveal dysfunction and had it removed (only part of the problem). She then underwent an ercp and this reveal sphincter of oddi dysfunction, very rare for children. Again, only part of the problem. The pancreas is the root of this evil. Do n't let them stop until you have an answer. If I had listened to the doctors, she would be the worst case of `nervous stomach/eating disorder ' known.######Hi, i was very interested to read your account- it sounds just like me, only I was 18 when it started. Like you, it took an age to get taken seriously, and they have now established that I have pancreas divisum (divided pancreas, you 're born with it, but it should n't be a cause on its own), no visible gallstones, no alcohol abuse (and you really have to work to get them to believe that when you 're in your 20s- they assume you 're out getting wasted every night!) . My situation now is that i 'm 32, and unfortunately I have continued to have about 2 attacks a year since 18. I am not diabetic, although there is a strong history of diabetes (1 and 2) in my family. I drink about two units a month, so barely anything, and I absolutely do n't think alcohol, or for that matter, food, have anything to do with triggering an attack. However, I do eat healthily, and exercise regularly. I 'd do this anyway- i 've always exercised, and never smoked (the one thing you must do is give up smoking- it 's got a host of links to damaging the pancereas, and our pancreases do n't need any excuse! It will also prove to the docs that you are doing everything you can). I live in the uk, and am about to go to liverpool to visit the research team there who specilaize in familial pancreatitis. One thing I have just come across this morning is a study at the bandolier site in the uk, which links selenium ace with possibly preventing further attacks. As I say, i 've only just seen this, but selenuim's a good thing to take anyway, and it 's worth a try! Let me know how you get on. It 's a tough disease, but the main things are getting the doctors to take you seriously and as the lady in the second message said, be pushy. It took them five years to diagnose my pancreatitis- and all it takes is a simple blood test. It will not go away on its own, so get in there and demand some attention! Good luck clare######Wow, that must be very hard having it twice a year- but at least you know what it is and can get straight to hospital so hopefully your enzymes do n't have a chance to get too high. Has it done permanent damage having so many attacks? Talk about doctors not understanding, my employers were also not happy as they thought oh she has pancreatitis it must mean she drinks loads hence its her fault she needs time off work! So now i 'm mostly self employed I run the risk of not being paid for a few days but at least I can avoid the constant pointless meetings about how much sick time I have had off and what I plan to do about it...! I did n't know smoking damaged pancreas that much, of course as if I need another reason to give up, I know it is no good whatsoever, but I have been good recently and a pack of 20 now easily lasts me over a week. Its a step in the right direction anyway! Yeah I have heard about the selenium thing a while ago, maybe studies were done in usa first, but its found in brazil nuts so if you like them its one less vitamin tablet to take! Pls let me know how you get on in liverpool. I have just been to hosp in croydon (possibly the worst in the uk!) to get my results of my recent mri scan, and when I walked into the room the ``doctor '' asked me why I was there !! Said I just want the results of scan, he asked if I was in pain, I said no I just want the results of scan, to which he asked if I would like him to examine me! By this point I was losing the will to live... He said he did n't have the test results, went out of the room for 10 minutes, came back and said they did n't find anything. How much I can believe him, I do n't know! Useless is not the word...######That 's what worries me most, really- every attack does some damage to the pancreases, so how much more attacks will it take before it packs up and we end up in a whole new world of pain? So, i 'm trying most things at the moment to stave off another attack. One thing which I have n't seen anyone discuss is when in the day their attacks come. Mine always, absolutely without fail, starts first thing in the morning. I either wake up with the pain, or it developed within an hour. I do n't know why this is- maybe it 's because the pancreas has been inactive over night and is starting to creak into action? I 'd be really interested in whether other people get it at the same time of day. What I want to avoid is it degenrating into constant, chronic pancreatitis. My mum is type 1 diabetic, so I do n't want to go there either! Also, we 'd like to have kids in the next couple of years- no desperate rush, but I think I need to start working out the risks. Pregnancy puts an extra load on the pancreas. I can find lots about people who havce had pancreatitis for the first time whilst pregnant, but have n't read anything yet on women with acute or chronic pancreatitis who 've been planning a family. Can anyone advise me? I 'm not expecting it to be an easy process, but at the moment I really do n't know what the chances and risks are. Hopefully the guys in liverpool may be able to help me with that as well. Clare######Yes thats what i 'm worried about two, I thought having 3 attacks was pushing my luck! 3 to you must seem great in comparison. My first two attacks started the same as yours, about an hour after waking up. With the third though I did n't get any pain until about 2pm, and was n't sure it was pancreatitis but took myself to hosp anyway due to history and amylase high at 1300 but lowest they had ever been. I do n't have any children so can not advise i 'm afraid. Hope you get some replies from women who can help with that, but out of interest how much extra stress does it put on the pancreas?######Yeah, it would really help to hear from some other people. There must be women out there who have had acute pancreatitis and wanted to have kids. I do n't really know much about this, which is one of the reasons why I want to get up to liverpool and get some info, but I know that it will be more complicated then usual. Apparantly one of the causes of ap is carrying (alhtough not necessarily having symptoms of) the cyctic fibrosis gene. One in 20 people in the uk carry the gene, so they 're going to test me for it, if I do have it, it 's really important that my husband gets tested as well, and if we both have it, that 's a whole new discussion. Apart from that, I just have n't had nine months without ap since I was 18, so the chances of me getting through a pregnancy unscathed are slim, I think, at the moment. As I understand it, all women are more at risk of getting ap when they are pregnant. I am assuming that that means that you and I are particularly at risk, and I have been told by one doctor that ap in pregnancy `usually ' results in miscarriage. But, that 's one doctors opion, and he was n't a specialist, so other dcotors may regard that as alarmist, or spot on. I do n't know. I could really do with some answers !! C######hey I read your posts and couldnt help but comment. . I had my first pancreatic attack when I was only 11 after that had 9 episodes in the time span of 2 years. After the two years I havent gotten any episode thank God, but to this date doctors havent found the cause. I went to Georgetown hospital, miami childrens hospital, Jackson Memorial, Baptist Hospital, John Hopkins hospital, Mayo Clinic in Rochester and tons of other hospitals and nobody could discover the cause. Now I am 20 years and havent suffered from a pancreatic attack, when i turned 19 I decided to try alcohol and since nothing happened i started to drink moderatly of course and rarely, my mom was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and i have decided to stop drinking so i wont end up in the same situation. We had tests done to test our genes and hereditary pancreatitis was not the cause apparently. I am registered as an unknown cause of pancreatitis but I think its hereditary that is the only explanation. Just wanted to let you all know######I had my first attack of acute pancreatitis one night when i went to bed. I didnt think anything of it and just went to sleep. the pain went on for another day and I thought I had pulled something and on the 3rd day of the attack the pain started moving to my back. so I went to the er and they did an ultrasound and a ct scan which all came back normal. when they got my results back from my blood panel my lipase was 10 times higher then it should be and so was my amylase. so I was in the hospital for 11 days and was sent home on pain meds and a low fat diet. The pain felt like it was going away and then 2 weeks later i started having the pain again but this time it was worse and I had started vomiting. so i went back to the er and the doctor said there wasnt anything they could do for me there and that he wanted me to go out of town to a different hospital where they could give me the right treatment. I was at the new hospital for 9 days and they didnt find any signs of gallstones and sent me home. I had a follow up with this new doctor and he did some lab test and my lip and amy was 5 times higher then what they should have been but lower then what they were when i had my attack and he gave me some pain killers and sent me home. I have 3 more attacks since the first 2 and this is all in a year. What do I do next since these doctors dont seem to want to help me get to the bottom of this..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

I only drink a few times a year. Gastro thought I was covering something up. More possibilities below: Idiopathic pancreatitis under age 40 Quote: Extensive or invasive evaluation is usually not recommended in those with a single episode of pancreatitis who are younger than 40 but some reports recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) even after one attack if the cause is not clear to look for pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors at or near the ampulla, microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct, and early chronic pancreatitis. Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

Would they have found something wrong with my pancreas thru blood works? or the endo? any suggestions?######What type of problem are you considering with your pancreas? I have chronic pancreatitis, which started out with several cases of acute pancreatitis. To check for that, the doc draws a blood sample and checks the amylase and lipase. Both of those are elevated in a case of acute pancreatitis, when checked while you are having pain. I have n't really heard of itching being associated with the pancreas. I 've only heard of it associated with the liver. Pancreatitis causes severe abdominal pain, mostly on the left upper quadrant of your abdomen, and can radiate to your left shoulder or back. Hope that helps some!######A drug reaction? A reaction to laundry detergent or fab. softener sheets, soap, shampoo? Once I had an allergic reaction to Gain that made me itch all over and made my lips swell up... can be dangerous.######i have changed my washing powder, but it isnt on my actual skin itching feels like its inside my body, but yes i agree the liver would give this symptom, but my lft was perfect only thing that bothers me is i have been having Gerd and probs with my stomach since i had hep b jabs to cover me for hospital work, i had to have 4 !! most are covered after one, im wondering if there was an overdose hence the probs, it seemed to start around that time, which was abt 2.5 yrs ago, i dunno im at a loss as to what to do, i certainly dont have pancreatic symptoms tho, no pain certainly not severe pain. just a feeling of upset a bit like IBS now with this itching grrrr, im taking operazomole for gerd have been for abt 4 months now..######-Health Issues###-General Health

I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich, than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E.. When im with my friends. I 've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana? Well, heres to everybody whos had to go through this damn disease, life aint over yall: wink:######Hi, i just wanted to say- be careful! I first developed symptoms at 18, was diagnosed at 25 and i 'm now 32, and i 've had 25 attacks, three within the last three months. It sounds as is your attacks are really mild- you 'll know if you need to go to hospital- because the pain gets way too bad to cope with! I do n't think my ap is linked to alcohol either, but I have cut it out, just to be sure. If you have to drink, I tink you 're better off with `long ' drinks such as wine, beer, etc.. Do n't drink spirits! And, sorry to say, you 've got to stop smoking, completely. It sends all your risk levels through the roof, and you ca n't afford it. You are already at an increased risk of cancer of the pancreas- very deadly, so you have to minimise all the other risks! Above all, do n't mess with this illness. I 've had it for a long time; sometimes it leaves me alone for 18 months, other times it hits again and again, and just takes over. Every time you 're ill your pancreas gets damaged, and you need it to last you the rest of your life. When you see what ap can do to you, it gives you a new appreciation- it can get much, much worse, so play by the rules in order to keep yours as mild as possible for as long as possible. I know it 's boring- having ap when you 're young is a real pain, but treat it with respect! C######thats good advice my son was diagnosed at 16 he is now 23 and been in and out of hospital allot and once in icu whilst on holiday in turkey, he dont touch alcohol and he still gets flare ups its a very scary illness######If you want to ward off pancreatitis, you need to stop drinking completely and smoking also. I have had to deal with pancreatitis for many years now, but more so in the last nine months. I was on a feeding tube for four months, and did n't think I was going to live through the last two attacks. Believe me, you do n't want to do anything that is going to make pancreatitis a part of your life. The quality of my life is not very good at all at the moment, and I would n't wish this on anyone. I have never been a drinker, but I do n't see why you ca n't just order a ``virgin '' when out with your friends......############every time u drink ur amylase and lipase will increase if the food you cosume contains a lot of fat pain may increase.as for ur marijuna aftr consuption u feel hungery and consume more food which might cause pancreatitis.######Hello, drinking with pancreatitis is always a bad idea !! And yes it can be avoided even when out with friends. Become the regular designated driver !! The attacks of pain you have following every time you drink should tell you it is a bad idea... With each acute attack you have, you are one step closer to chronic pancreatitis. And believe me- you do not want to be chronic !! My first attack happened when I was 8 years old (now 48). I have been chronic for the last 6 years. It is life stealer !!! It do n't kill you but it will sometimes make you wish it did. It is disabling (i have not been able to work since 2001). The pain is 24/7 and no matter what you do it never goes away. Yet you also get attacks when the pain is unbearable. Additionally chronic pancreatitis leads to many other disorders- the worse of which is type 1 brittle diabetes- uncontrollable diabetes. This comes with all the side effects of diabetes. Malabsorption is another problem. You can literally starve to death, even though you are eating. It causes all kinds of vitamin and mineral inbalances with come with their own problems. Please think twice before you take another drink. Each drink puts you closer to being chronic... And there are many more problems associated with chronic pancreatitis that I am not listing here. Reeann############Hi all. I 've just had my first attack of Acute Pancreatitis. I was rushed to ER and they gave me morphine, put me on a drip, gave me loads of antibiotics and would n't let me eat. I must admit it was pretty scary- I went in to shock and very nearly died. So I 've just got out of hospital and I do n't know very much about what to do next. The doctors did n't give me any advice except to only eat light meals ?! I see that alcohol is bad- that 's ok can live without that! Can anyone give me any advice? Am I likely to get it again? Thank you... Emma######research and learn to eat, and be devoted to, a non fat diet. I did not say low fat, I said non fat. It is the most important thing and I do n't see it on these posts. Maybe people do n't know how to eat to live with this disease. Please google non fat diets. Work up some recipes you like and stick to them, and carry a tupperware container of these foods with you if you go out. NO ALCHOHOL whatsoever. Do n't even smell it. Put mustard on your sandwich, no cheese no mayo. No egg yolks, buy egg whites in a container and scramble. maybe a slice of non fat cheese on the top. No butter at all, not light butter, nothing of the sort. No birthday cake or pastries, have angel cake instead. Spend a year working on the non fat diet and you will adapt very quickly. Never go off it. this is the way you will live from now on. It takes attention but you will be able to live with it easily once you get the hang of it. Take yours with you, is my advice.############i had an episode of acute pancreatitis about 4 years back. It was intense pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the back.my glucose level was also slightly high. sinnce then i have stopped drinking completely. thereafter i never had any problems whatsoever.my glucose also is normal.but thereafter my calcium level is always low. now i am taking calcium supplements 3 times a day. the absorption is very poor. i also have to take vitamin d. can i now start drinking occasionaly.######My boyfriend has been hospitalized 4 times in the last year for pancreatitis but he continues to drink, now the doctor said this can kill him is that true? He does not seem to get it he thinks that they are just make things up can this kill him if he does not stop drinking ???######I 've had a very serious acute pancreatitis attack 3 days ago... the pain got worse throughout the day and at 1am in the morning I was n't able to take it anymore and asked my husband to bring me to the ER. I stayed in the ER for 6 hours, got an IV, they took my blood, urine samples, and did an ultrasound. It did not take them too long to figure out that I had acute pancreatitis, but they said they can not figure out why- I do n't really drink (maybe once in 4 months ??) and I do n't have gallstones- two of the most common causes for acute pancreatitis. I asked my mother if she had symptoms like that before or if it was in my family, and actually she said she had something like that before, similar pain, but back then they were not able to give her a correct diganosis (40 years ago). I am only 25, and had pain in my stomach before, however, I never took it seriously or it was never that bad that I had to go to the doctor or to the hospital. I have n't had any solid food in 3 days, I am scared to eat because of the pain. I am drinking lots of water and broth, but even decaf tea or chicken broth gives me pain, not too much, but I can tell that it takes time to get better. I got pain reliever like vicodin, which knock me out. I wonder if I can ever go back to my regular diet, I never really cared what I ate before, it was usually a very balanced diet, and sometimes it happened to be a bit fatty/oily. I will have a follow up appmt with my doctor next week and I 'll try to find out more if I have to adjust my diet from now on. Is it normal to feel pain when drinking broth/ tea after acute pancreatitis?######If drink was the cause of your acute pancreatitis, give it up, because when- and it will be when- you develop chronic pancreatitis, you 'll remember all those blase evenings of getting trashed with absolute regret, while being in total agony in the present and unable to think clearly about your fearsomely shortened future. Drink can be fun, until it is n't, and when it 's threatening your wellbeing, just give it up. Seriously. i ca n't put into words the extent to which you 'll rue the day you carry on.######hey guys.... . im 16 yrs old i have had two attacks of acute pancreatitis lol its acyually funny im sitting at mayo clinic now getting a bunch of tests done for this... i was first told i hace this two weeks before my 16 birthday and have since had to make a lot of lifestyle changes... i used to drink about 3 times a month with my buddys but havnt had a drop of alchahol since my first aattack... i also used to smoke cicgarettes (about a pack a day) but quit after my second attack... both times i was put on a low fat diet which is 50 grams of fat per day... for all who dont know that is about 5 tablespoons of mayonase !!!!! i was recently told i could continue a normal diet but have chosen not to... i guess i really dont want to take the risk of getting it again... for 1 it is way painfull... i dont know how many times i blacked out bc of it... and for two i am now repeating a semester of my sophmore yera bc i missed so much school and i just kind of gave up. . plus it really isnt worth the week in the hospital and not eating for three days.... if you ever want to know more or want to ask n e questions you can message me... ttyl guys....######i had ap to. almost died. multiple organ failure followed along with adult respitory distress syndrome. ap usually doesnt go this far but for me it did... my pancreas shot poison into my body. . making my lungs shut down... do i drink now? yes i do... just not as much... i do not expierence stomach pain when i do it though but am always watching for any sign of it, cause then id stop. Life goes on. Doctors will naturally tell you not to do it... but i dont worship that religion and a doctor is not a priest for me as it is for so many others. Listen to your inner most voice. . and it will tell you what you are allowed and what you are not. Pay attention to pain, it is there to warn you and tell you something is not right. I always had warning signs but unfortunately i did not listen to them... i thought drinking more would make the pain go away... and before you judge me... let me say this... im sick of encyclopidia people who believe everything they are told You have a disease... you must be aware of it, but you must live and be merry as well... be the designated drive... ha! some people arent that boring If i sound like a ahole... fine.... but im sick of hearing stupid advice that not based on fact the truth is they dont know where the limit it so they say dont do it at all... i say dont do it at all if you are too stupid to find your limit... but if not, find your limit and listen to your body...... and live and laugh... life is too short to go through it trying to prolong by erasing all the little pleasures... those who want the last years where u pee your bed and cant move... you go ahead and live healthy to die long.... i dont want to die long and im sick of your opra, self help answers######I am writting even though I it may be premature to do so. But I have been devasted by the news at the docs. I have had some discomfort in my right side abdomen just under the edge of my rib cage. I had an ultrasound done and the doc told me I have a cyst in my pancreas... now I am scheduled for a CT scan and I am freaking out of what it might be. The doctor has put a rush on it. . and this has made me even more nervous. I drink but mostly on weekdays, and usually have a beer daily... what is going on ??? I have had heart burn and bloating as well for some time, and many times loose stools. Guess I am looking for good news or something comforting... anyone know what is going on and should I worry ???######A Brief Journey of my pain In January 2010 I experienced my first symptoms of pain which turned out initially to be jaundice followed by a diagnosis of gallstones which meant an admission into hospital in early February 2010. After my first admission eating fatty foods was a key cause of the episodes of pain and was told by the consultant to have my gallbladder out 6 weeks ago but instead gave me 3 months to decide as I was not in a fit state of mind to decide whether I really wanted it so was expected to give him my decision on 13th July this year. I have continued to cut down on fatty foods and have lost almost 3 stones in weight since the beginning of the year, I am not grumbling about the weight loss however I would have preferred to do it differently avoiding pain attacks relating to food intake. I now eat substantially less and better variety of diet along with gentle exercise a few times a week, these pain occurrences have totally changed my life, clothes are loose and although I was t-total before now I will be for the indefinite future as I donâ$ t want food and alcohol relating to further pancreatitis so overall despite the discomfort in hospital I am much healthier and happier. Events superseded my decision to have my gallbladder out late July 2010 so in May this year was admitted again with gallstone induced pancreatitis which was extremely painful resulting a week or so later with my gallbladder removed. I was petrified of the operation but I had it done as I could not bear any more pain so I took the risk of general surgery via key hole. Waiting 8 hours in squelching UK heat was not pleasant especially when you are nil by mouth. On 29th June I was discharged from the consultant only to find a week later I was admitted with a further episode of an infection of the pancreas spending seven nights at the local hospital. Now I hope they have gone for good so when I see the consultant surgeon at the end of August I can try and be discharged for a second time. This time I had severe hiccups, excess sweating and lots of vomiting adding to jaundice, gallstone and acute pancreatitis, why do things in halves, all this when I donâ$ t drink, smoke, eat pretty healthily and have good health yet I have all of this unlucky or what.

Mark Crossley######hello all im 25 years old, i drank wine everyday for the past two years at least a bottle maybe two. i was jus released from the hospital today for pancreatitis. my levels were all off my pancreas was at 10,000 my potassium, and other electrolytes were low. i was in the hospital for 5 days the dr. told me i should not drink anymore as i could possible develop cronic pancreatitis. my question is did anyway experience a bloating around their abdomen or weight gain in that area after being released from the hospital? i was fed thru an iv and given pain pills so i cant understand what the reason would be for the weight gain. thanks in advance######Yes it is very normal to have bloating and gassy feeling when you are released from the hospital and it lasts for weeks until it is finally gone. Your stomach can look and feel huge! I am not sure about the weight gain except I know that the pain killers they give you cause you to be constipated and you need to be on stool softeners most times. I have been in the hospital 8 times with this and struggle to quit drinking but know if I do n't that I will develop chronic pancreatitis which will eventually kill me.######I just got out of the hospital today after four days in there. I was on the IV the whole time and I gained 10 pounds and my stomach is totally bloated still. I did not have any food till this morning, which was some of that hospital egg stuff. It did not hurt after eating it so my doc let me go home. The couple of doctors that I talked to said that I can go back to my regular diet (which consist of meat, dairy and junk, no fruits of vegies) as soon as I felt comfortable. They also told me to stop drinking for two weeks and then I can drink again. I do not drink every day and only have a couple of beers unless it is some sort of weekend away, then I can drink a lot.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago. I was in Tanzania when I got it and was rushed into hospital because the pain was unbearable. After 3 days there I flew back to England and remained in hospital for another 10 days. During my stay I had ultra sound scans, a CT scan, a cannular put in and over 25 blood tests. I wasnt allowed to eat or drink for 5 days. They said they thought it might be the malaria tablets I had been taking- doxycycline, but they couldnt confirm it and wrote down it was idiopathic on my discharge form. Ive been told I can try drinking again after 3 months but I 'm pretty terrified of it coming back- I cant handle that pain again! I think i will drink in the future if I can, just not binge drinking, which my doctor said should be fine.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago.

In july of 2002 I started getting severe pains in my upper right stomach. These pains went on until last year off and on, when I was told I had chronic pancreatitis. I have never been a big drinker. And nothing really seems to bring it on. Has anyone heard of these to having something to do with eachother? Or anyone have similar gastric problems after the gastric by pass? I have had no other problems. Thanks######I had gastric bypass on july 30, 2002. I began with pancreatitis in sept.. Of 2003. Well, that is when it was diagnosed. I have not found anyone else who has had gastric bypass who has it! I thought I was all alone in this. Do you have a cyst on your pancrea also? Have you gotten help for your pancreatitis? I can not have the ercp done because of my gastric bypass so I may have to have the whipple procedure done to remove part of my pancreas. The docs assure me it has nothing to do with my bypass but I ca n't help but think it did! Let me know how you are, I would love to know if we have similar issues! Dixiemailman######I had gastric bypass about 3 year ago. My gallbladder was removed shortly thereafter. I 've gone symptom free for about a year and a half and suddenly find myself back in a bad situation. I have been having severe upper abdominal pain = heart palpatations and bouts of nausea, vomiting and fainting. At first they said it was vertigo- but that has n't seemed to pan out. I am tired of tests, dr visits, etc.. It seems that it is my pancreas. I ca n't help but think this is all somehow related. I see my Dr on Wed for the ``official '' diagnosis. I have days that go by and I do n't feel any pain, just discomfort. On other days- its overwhelming- I find it hard to think of little else other than stopping the pain. I have n't had a good nights sleep in weeks it seems. This is all new to me, so I hope that it is in a treatable stage. I do n't relish taking medicine again- since this was one of the main reasons I had the bypass done. I 've been without perscription meds and it has been wonderful- until now. What a trade off ????######i had a GBP in september 2006, and just in the last few months, started with the pancreatitis. never know what will set it off, tuna one day, and not the next. bread hurts... no booze... sour cream started this last one. but five guys hamburgers (ok, so half a hamburger), does n't hurt. it 's the most annoying thing in the world. mother's day sucked because i could n't eat anything. i ended up just having a grilled burger. one taste of potato salad, and i was under the table with pain. i 'm so tired, i ca n't work, i ca n't concentrate, and the fainting and other stomach issues are getting worse, vomiting and diahrrea. i could go on but i wo n't. good luck to all of you... Judy######The M & J talk show today 7/7/09 seems to say there is a connection between gastric by pass and pancreatitis something about bands and the way the used to do the procedure######I have had Gastric Bypass surgery Jan 2004 and in Dec of 2008 had an episode of acute pancreatitis. The doctors immediately blamed it on drinking too much and did n't look any further. In my own research on the topic it does appear as if I may have triggered the bout of pancreatitis with alcohol to some extent however all the information I can find indicates that a person will have been a ``heavy '' drinker (more than 10 units a day; a 750 ml bottle of 12% wine has 9 units) for as much as 10- 15 years prior to a first episode of pancreatitis. By the definitions they use, I would qualify as a heavy drinker but I have only been drinking at this level for about 2 years... I am wondering if the Gastric Bypass Surgery has in some way made me more vulnerable to pancreatitis from drinking? Obviously since December 2008 I have significantly cut back on my drinking but every time I ``slip '' up and drink even less than I used to drink before the first episode I have a flare up. I have not seen my doctor about subsequent episodes. If anyone has any information on the relationship of pancreatitis and gastric bypass surgery I would appreciate a reply.######I had my Bypass in 2004, my Gallbladder out in 2007, and I began having pancreatitis in 2008. I 've been hospitalized twice with the pain. I 've had MRI's, CAT Scans, scoped, ultrasounds (inside and out) and no cause has been found. When I start hurting it can last 5-10 minute or 1-2 hours. I just keep phenergan and lortab around for the pain. I wish I could find a treatment/cure. After an attack, it takes me 2-4 days to get over it and back to work.######I had gastric bypass surgery in 2005. Recently I was in the hospital with diverticulitus, but still did n't feel well after I got out of the hospital. After additional testing my lipase numbers are over 1000 and I have been diagnosed with pancreatitis- however the cause has yet to be determined. I am very frustrated and am tired of feeling like crap. It also bothers me that the first thing the doctors go to when everything else turns up negative is alcohol. I do drink, but not daily and not in access. I asked whether or not the gastric bypass might be a cause of the problem and was told no. Now I am starting to wonder. Has anyone's doctor ever said yes?######Lori i to just found out that i have chronic pancreatitis but it took 8 years and countless docs to tell me. Finally the University of Minnesota hospital found it. And my doc there actually said to me that him and the gastric bypass should start a clinic for women who have had gastric bypass and then get pancreatitis, he said they see it EVERY day! and that they are definetly related! I have had countless docs tell me that my ``problems '' were not related to the bypass which i knew was bs cause they started after it. good luck to you######I had my gallbladder removed in 2003 and had gastric bypass in 2004. Suddenly last Spring (March 09) I started having upper abdominal pain that I thought was due most likely to a tear after a violent vomiting episode (although I described the pain as exactly the same as when I had gallstones). I went to my bypass dr who prescribed prilosec and some liquid stuff used for ulcers. She said it should get better on its own in 4-6 weeks. It did n't. After 6 months of pain I went to a different doctor who did n't really have a clue what to think. They did a ct scan and said they saw a clump of what they figured was undigested fiber in my stomach and scheduled surgery immediately Oct 2009. After the surgery the dr said he did n't find anything at all. (yeah that was fun.) Even though he did n't find anything the pain disapppeared for 5 glorious pain free months. Last weekend it came back with a vengence. I have n't gotten more than 1 hour of sleep at a time this whole week because the pain wakes me over and over. I 'm exhausted. Today I got a surprise, light colored yellow/gray stools and I 'm sure it 's nothing I ate that made it that way and I 've been getting dumping syndrome (dizziness, sweating, shaking, confusion, light headedness, nausea, diarrhea and chills) even after eating protein which usually us what I eat to feel make that feeling go away. I really do n't want to go back to any of the doctors I 've seen. It 's clear to me they do n't know whats going on and their meds are n't helping. They keep telling me to take them before I get the pain but unfortunately I ca n't really plan for that outside of bedtime because thats the only time it consistantly happens... which by the way the meds give me at the most (and I 'm being generous here) 3-5 minutes relief before the pain is back full force. I 'm not like others I 've read about. I do n't notice anything specific I eat causing the pain, it 's so random it drives be crazy. It 's dibilitating. I ca n't sit still when it hurts and I ca n't think of anything else but the pain when it 's hurting. I live in Minneapolis and would like to know the name of the doctor dshiffer1974 posted about at UofM hospital. Please, if anyone has the name of a doctor who can help in the twin cities area I would really appreciate it !!######mystc77 i see dr freeman and dr leslie at the u of m dr leslie is a gastric bypass doc and freeman is pancreas doc. Light colored oily stool is a sure sign of pancreatitis, let me know if you have any other questions i dont want anyone to suffer like i have######Thank you for your quick response. This has been going on so long and I frustrated at the fact that I 've told the drs that I 've had my gallbladder removed and the pain I feel is the same as when I had gallstones and they did n't even consider a pancreas issue. I did n't either but then I 'm not a doctor. Last time I searched this stuff I did n't find anything about pancreatitis but I 've done more than enough reading tonight to know this has to be whats going on. Are you familiar with Dr. Sibley? She 's also with UofM. After looking at the Endocrinologists there she 's the one I 'm most interested in seeing (she specializes in Thyroid disfunction which I also have). A one stop shop for me! No matter what I 'm going to walk in at Fairview Hospital in Maple Grove tomorrow if tonight is like every other night this week... which I have no doubt it will be... it 's already started. Dr. Sibley sees patients there so I 'm hoping to get a referral to her when I 'm there. I honestly do think there should be a clinic for post GBP patients for this after seeing how many people have had this same problem. If not a clinic, there should at least be a risk listed to pre-op patients so they know what to look for and where to go for help if it happens. I would have appreciated it. Even in hindsight had I known this was a possibility I would still have had my GBP surgery. I still think it was the best thing I could have ever done for myself.######Debra R I had my gall bladder removed because of many acute pancreatitus attacks. Then Dr. Berry Sanchez in Burlingame CA removed my stones in a difficult surgery because I also had a gastic bypass surgery in 2004. The acute pancreatitis is gone but I still have a burning feeling in the left side of my back and in the middle of my stomach at times. The pain is not too bad compared to the acute pancreatitus. I started juicing and I have given up all meats period! I only eat fresh fruits and veggies and tuna. I am losing a lot of weight but I wish this burning feeling goes away. Acute Pancreatitus can turn into chronic pancreatitus if one of your attacks damages or scars your pancreas. I need more than two hands to count how many attacks I had before the stones were removed and my last one was really bad. I know doctors are not perfect and there are so many things being discovered, and for that reason alone is why I am not considering sueing the Dr. the lied when he documented that there were no stones left in me when he removed my gall bladder. He told me himself that he thought he left stones. Nevertheless, I know he was not able to remove them so no hard feelings.######First, I must say thank you to all for being willing to share your experiences here. I had GBP (Roux-en-Y) in June of 2004, lost 100 lbs., and had good health for over 5 years. I was feeling really good, exercising, eating healthy and, of course, increased self esteem. At the time of my surgery, I do n't know if I was informed that all I am experiencing now was a risk, and I chose to ignore that, or that I was never informed. In retrospect, given all that I am experiencing now, I do n't believe I would have had the surgery. Over the last 1-1/2 years, I had put regained 17 lbs. In January of this year, I joined Weight Watchers, and lost 11 lbs. Feeling good about that too. In April of this year, I woke up to excruciating abdominal pain that radiated to my back. I immediately went to the emergency room. It was worse than labor pains, in my experience. Blood work showed acute pancreatitis, as my pancreatic (amylase) and liver (lipase) levels were extremely high. I was admitted to hospital, on IV, for several days. I do n't know what caused it. I am not a drinker, although I did have 2 glasses of red wine & coffee with Bailey's Irish Cream the weekend prior to pancreatitis attack. At this time, my diagnosis was not attributed to GBP, while I had my doubts, given that 95% of the time, I eat healthy choices, and rarely drink alcohol. Then, on May 5th, I woke up to abdominal pain that also radiated to my back. Went to the Emergency Room. Was n't pancreatitis this time; was intussusception of my intestines, plus something else involving the abdomen, (it 's all on my CT scan report in medical jargon). Basically, my abdomen, where the suture site was from GBP was grossly enlarged, and my intestines where twisted and then ``telescoped '' into each other (that 's the intussusception part). I was admitted to hospital & had emergency surgery that same afternoon. I was grateful that the Chief of Bariatric Surgery (Dr.Borao) was at the hospital when the ER surgical resident told me I needed immediate surgery. If anyone was going to operate on me, I wanted someone that knew the anatomy of a GBP patient. Dr. Borao came to see me in the ER & told me that if I did n't have the surgery, it would rupture and within 24-48 hours I could die. Of course, I had no opposition to the surgery, and Dr. Borao saved my life. Was in intensive care for several days, and after a week came home with gastric tube that has is now removed. After coming home I thought my discomfort was related to healing, but after new bloodwork and CT scan of pelvis & abdomen, there are additional challenges. Bloodwork indicates my amylase & lipase levels are elevated, and I now have what appears to be colitis, as per CT report: ``wall thickening involving ascending colon. Inflammatory chgs of fat are seen surrounding the ascending colon & proximal transverse colon. This is suggestive of a long segment of colitis, suspicious for long segmentof colitis. '' I have read on the web that those with pancreatitis are higher risk for pancreatic cancer. My greatest fear is pancreatic cancer and colostomy. I 'm usually a very upbeat, positive person, but this persistent discomfort, bouts of pain, tests, uncertainty and insomnia have so diminished the quality of my life. I find myself regretting having the GBP at all. This is so not worth all that I 'm going through. Sorry for being so lengthy in my post. I 'm stressed over it, and need to focus on my healing and not my fear. Duke University Hospital was recommended for all gastro treatment as that is their specialty. I noted comments about U of Minnesota. Feedback would be appreciated and, yes, having a facility for post-gastric by pass patients would be phenomenal. Penina11######I must tell you that jucing has helped me a lot. I stopped eating meat and I only eat fish, low to no fat foods, and eat six really small meals a day. My body can no longer handle the big meals. I did a lot of praying and I know that this is now my lifestyle. Juicing spinach, beets, and blueberries repairs your insides. I also drink lots of water per day because Chronic Pancreatitis will allow you to get dehydrated quick. I have gone down two pant size and I am going down another. All of my clothes are too big for me (praise God for that) and I feel really good. I only have mild pain when I am hiking or doing major exercise and the pain is really mild. I stay away from foods that are harmful to me and you find out good diets for those who suffer with chronic pancreatitis all over the web. Just type in Chronic pancreatitis diets. They will pretty much tell you to juice and stay away from high fat foods. I hate that I had to give up coffee but I boldly drink about half a cut once a week. I dont get sick with that amount.######I had my Gastric Bypass in 2006, I have now been diagnosed with Chronic Pancreatitis. I was fortunate that the Doctors Discovered it early, and they did attribute it to my bypass surgery right from the start. But I still have extreme pain sometimes and have Found Gabapentin to work wonders !!! A great pain killer that leaves me with no side effects. Diet is a big part to pain control though. I have recently started taking enzymes to help with digestion so I will see how that goes. I feel for anyone who has to go through this. The one interesting thing that took them along time to figure out was through a MRI they found a fluid filled sack between my pancreas and my stomach (not attached) and if it was big enough they would have drained it, but it wasnt. They are hoping that it will go down on its own and I will be having another MRI in 4 months to check the progress. So if you are still having bouts of pain maybe ask your doctor about this. It can only be seen through an MRI. Good luck to all and here it to our health######WOW !!! Very enlightening posts !!! Thank you everyone... sooo...... I had GBP April 2009. Was fine until 4 days ago, when I had mild pain all day, right in the center of my stomach. Went to my PCP and he did bloodwork. Next day they told me the bloodwork was fine, but my pancreas was slightly irritated. (did n't contact GPB surgeon, since I went to him over Christmas for what turned out to be the flu, and he would n't even examine me !! Had his PA do an exam, because he did n't want to catch what I had !!! And said, he will only see me if I want something ``cut out '' of me !!) At any rate, I am on a bland diet through the weekend... actually, the pain went away shortly after seeing PCP... sooo... now I am sooo paranoid.... I know people with SERIOUS complications from pancreatitis, and do n't want to get any worse... I am hoping this is n't the start of horrible things to come.... . I will speak with my pcp for an update, tomorrow... I am going to speak w/him regarding the connection with GBP....######I am absolutely beside myself to hear that other people are suffering from pancreatitis- post gastric by-pass! I am a 41 year old mom of 3. In Sept/2004, I had the Rioux-En-Y Gastric done in Duluth, Minnesota (USA) I live right by Thunder Bay/Kakabeka falls, Ontario Canada. (3 hrs away from Duluth) I weighed 278 lbs! I had severe bleeding complications immediately following the surgery. Following months of recovery, I returned to my job as a By-Law Enforcement Officer with Thunder Bay Animal Services. I started suffering from severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, thinning hair, brittle nails and horrible, smelling diarrhea/watery/grey colored stools. FINALLY, 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Acute Pancreatitis. I nearly lost my life from the complications, have had numerous, numerous tests, blood transfusions and seizures. I have been in hospital more than I have been at home. My arms are so scarred from the picc lines and IV sites and now I have developed horrible, puss/fluid filled lesions on my lower legs and forearms. I have severe pain during the height of these attacks that lasts for weeks, but my amalyase and lipase levels are not even spiking anymore. All of the doctors are telling me there is nothing more that they can do. They have tried to perform 2 ERCP's but can not get into the area they need to because my anatomy is changed due to the gastric by pass. I have been in intensive care and our parish priest read me my last rites just last July. By the grace of God, I pulled through and here I am today, scared as hell and trying to live a life! I had a TRANSDUODENAL SPINCTEROTOMY (stent) last October and did so well for 3 months! I even returned to work, but only lasted 2 weeks before ending up in hospital again! Since February of this year, I have had 8 hospital admissions, lasting weeks at a time. My children have had to help carry me to the bathroom, watch in horror as I have had convulsive seizures. . I can not leave my home because I MUST stay close to the bathroom at all times! I have severe diarrhea, horrible smelling gas and spontaneous vomiting. I have lost ridiculous amounts of weight (dropped down to 121 lbs) I have NEVER weighed that in my life !! and had lost most of my hair last year. What did grow back is very fine and very silver- nothing that a little color magic ca n't fix- AND I am very grateful to have some now! Nevertheless, I have tried to go back to the surgeons who performed the by-pass in Duluth, Minnesota, but they will not return my phone calls. The Toronto, Ontario surgeon, Dr. Gary May (bless his heart), tried to do the 1st ERCP, but the scope could not reach and I somehow went into septic shock and wound up in ICU for several days. I was medi-vac 'd back to the hospital in Thunder Bay. I had another attempt under general anesthetic for the ERCP, but the surgeon could not get in the area, once again- different surgeon this time. I am currently awaiting a 3rd attempt with the double balloon scope in Toronto- hopefully soon. I have been told that there is nothing more that really could be done. I did hear that the gastric by-pass could be reversed, but really. . what good would it do now as my pancreas is now severely damaged. (air pockets have been found with my last CT/MRI) The doctors just do n't know how severe it is. I am so desperate. I barely leave my bedroom anymore. I was put on OCTREOTIDE ACETATE. I do 2-1 ml injections 3 x 's a day. I still have not got a straight answer as to why I am on this! The needles get very painful and I also have to have Gravol injections, daily. I am currently on 30mg's of Dilaudid/Hydromorphone every 3-4 hours. I just wained off of the Fentanyl Patch. I was on 300 mcg's of Fentanyl and 6 mls IV Dilaudid every 3 hours, last summer. I am also on Cotazyme/Maalox/high blood pressure meds/several anti-depressants/b -12 injections/Ativan-prn/Motillium- ENOUGH, Already! I just started seeing a pain specialist, but I am told I have to learn to live with this pain. HOW ???? I can not even make an appointment for a measly hair cut because I am so unpredictably sick all of the time. . It hits with no warning anymore... and then the ambulance, once again has to cart me to the emergency room where I wait for a bed for days at a time in the hallways. I have also developed a horrible problem with seeing my face so distorted in the mirror. It scares me to go through this! I am not so much afraid of dying from this. . I am so scared of leaving my husband and children without a wife and mother. . And the PAIN !! It terrifies me !! I am begging anyone to PLEASE write me and I will send more contact information to you. I am desperate to know how many others' suffer the same hell or if there is any way we can do something about this. Please- Let 's not do this alone. Thanks for reading about my plight. - Maria Lichtenfeld, Murillo, Ontario Canada######I found these posts accidentally, as I was looking for information about Gastric bypass as a treatment for chronic pancreatitis. I have had CP for as long as I can remember. Anyway, I just wanted to post a little info here for those that are looking for information. There is/was a doc in Minnesota, Dr. Sutherland, not sure where exactly, but I do know that he and his team have worked miracles for people suffering with CP via the procedure called Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Cell Transplant. There are also excellent docs at IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN. Dr. Sherman and Lehman (the latter I have heard recently retired, but he was a big help to me when no one else was.) have done extensive studies on the pancreas and diseases that affect the pancreas. I am so sorry that you all have had to suffer the effects of chronic pancreatitis and hope that somehow, whether through your docs or others, you will find the answers you are so desperately seeking. I can also point you in the direction of a few support groups in ``Yahoo groups '', if you use the yahoo/google search and type in `yahoo groups, chronic pancreatitis ' you will see that there are a few groups there. Some are more active than others, but they all offer information and support from people who, like you are suffering with this terrible affliction. I hope that I will see you all signing up for some of these groups and that I 'll see that you are finally getting answers and feeling much better. I surely understand the frustration and hopelessness that one feels in dealing with this disease. Take care and please all be well, (((HUGZ))) Denise Williams in Michigan.######do n't do it if you have a gal bladder. . cause gal bladder will go bad do to weight loss. Surgens can not retrieve the stones in bile ducts. surgens have to put a feeding tube inside the grown together area of the stomach. they have to carve there way threw it and open it up. It took 4 months to get well. 10 weeks to get the stones out, after staff infection, that had to be cut out of my back. it takes 3-4 weeks after tube is inserted in stomach before they can do surgery if all goes well. plus this danger of pancreatitis begins i was lucky with that so far. sept 11 2001 till now nov 23 2010 another problem persist were the feed tube was inserted my stomach grew to my chest wall fills like my stomch is twisted in a bind all the time because it ca n't fall into its normal place. best luck to you all.

So much so, that I 've now been labeled as having chronic bronchitis. But it 's the constant sinusitis and allergies that bring it all on. I 'm on Advair 500, Singulair, Albuterol rescue and a couple allergy meds. No, my asthma is not under control, but my pulmonologist and allergy/asthma specialist are working on that. However, I have many days with tightness in my chest, fatigue that only responds to a 2 hour nap, slight productive/non-productive cough, and shortness of breath if I do anything physical. I build up to 7 min. on my eliptical trainer only to have several attacks in one day and back to being unable to carry the laundry up and down the steps. Other days, I seem almost like a normal person. I ca n't believe how much this has changed my lifestyle- do the rest of you cope with drastic changes in your daily routines? Can this ever be gotten under control so you can live relatively symptom-free? TIA, Jasthma######Sorry to hear you are struggling. I, too, have asthma. I was diagnosed about 8 years ago after being on allergy shots for 4 years! I have no idea how that happened. I thought allergy shots would DECREASE my chance to develope asthma. Anyway, my asthma is pretty stubborn. I do n't really have too many symptoms unless I am sick, but my airways are always constricted to a degree. My spirometry test showed improvement with Advair, but I am still not in the normal range. I ca n't jog or run up steps, but I can exercise on a treadmill. I just need to do more of it. Things that help me feel better are: eating apples, staying away from junk food, drinking hot tea and water, using a saline irrigation for my sinuses and trying to stay out of the wind, especially on days that the pollen count is high. I bronchitis symptoms right now, but my doctor said, it 's not. I still feel miserable. I have a cough and so much phlegm. Spring is really bad for me. Right now I am looking into alternative medicine, accupuncture, and food supplements to see if there is anything that will help. Go online and in your search engine type ``simple sugars for your health '' and educate yourself! Cindy######Hi I am sorry to hear that you are having such a hard time with your asthma. I know that there are many people that do have their asthma under control and can live more symptom free than what I do. I have had asthma for 11 years and it seems to be getting more uncontrolled especially in the last 5 1/2 years since I moved about 1 hour north west of where I was living for 4 years. I am on advair 500-50, flovent 500, spriva, ventalin as needed, flonase, aerius for asthma and allergies. I have had a number of opions from allergists and asthma doctors with no miracle answers. I have been somewhat better in the last 6 months due to stomach problems and losing 40 pounds. I am currently on 50 mg of prednisone hopefully just short term because I have been on many rounds of it. I hope they can come up with something that will help all of us with breathing difficulties that are struggling. Let me know how you are doing.######Thank you both SO MUCH. I just read somewhere that 55% of asthma patients feel their symptoms are not controlled. Do either of you- or anyone else- get hyperventillation if you try to ``keep going '' when you begin having heavy breathing? I do n't ever wheeze; I just get short of breath. If I continue any physical activity, it gets worse until I begin to hyperventillate. This is NOT due to anxiety. I am so smoothed out by the meds I 've always taken for chronic depression and a little social anxiety- I KNOW when I 'm getting psychosomatic symptoms. And the hyperventillation comes only when I continue to try to finish the shopping, or climb the steps with the laundry basket, or complete straightening up the house in spite of getting more and more breathless. Does this happen to anybody else with asthma? BTW, I take Advair 500/50, Singular 10 mg., Flonase, Zyrtec & Albuterol for attacks. Thx again, Jasthma.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

It 's nothing really, You just blow long and hard in this tube and that measures the amount of air going through your lungs. Cindy######Hi, yes I have this symptoms due to my allergies. I went to the respiratory doctor and he ruled out asthma. So I just take extra care not to come in contact with my allergens.######I seem to get a bit of this with my allergies.

I 'm a 22 year old female in excellent shape and have had allergic/exercise induced asthma my whole life, which has never been a problem for me... the rescue inhaler always helped. This past April I started biking 20 miles a week and increasing my jogging distance... i literally felt the best i have ever felt in my life. Then May 1, I woke up short of breath, so i took my rescue inhaler, but it did n't help. I 've been to the ER, admitted to the hospital, and had all heart and blood tests done which all came back normal. I have been to a Pulmonary Dr. several times. I 've tried a daily corticosteroid and prednisone, both of which did n't help. Some days i feel almost normal with my breathing and some days i 'm very short of breath. I had a Pulmonary Function Test when i was very short of breath and it showed restrictive results as opposed to obstructive which suggest asthma. My total lung capacity was decreased. Then I had another PFT on a day when i felt pretty good and it came back in the normal range. The doctor does n't have an answer for me. He ca n't explain why I have restrictive attacks. I also saw an ENT and he looked down my throat and everything was normal. I feel like i ca n't inhale well and i ca n't get a deep breath. It feels very constricted at times. It 's not consistent though, because every so often i feel like i can breathe pretty good but it doesnt last long. This has completely ruined my life... i 've missed so much work and i ca n't do things i would normally do. Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you.######I should also mention that every time i 'm short of breath, even when i had the restrictive PFT results, my pulse oximetry was 100%.######You know, my PFTs are also weird that way. The total lung capacity is low-normal, but my ratio is HIGH. My peak flows are really high. Do you know what triggers these attacks? Do antihistamines help at all? Or have you tried anticholinergic inhalers (Atrovent?)######Thank you so much for answering! My peak flows are around 350. I 've used claritin D on and off for years and lately I 've been taking it everyday so my allergies wo n't aggravate my asthma and make the shortness of breath worse. I tried Pulmicort, which made my heart race and beat irregular. Then i was on Flovent for 3 weeks and i thought it might have been helping... i was still short of breath but not too bad... then one day i got severely short of breath and that 's when i had the PFT done and it showed restrictive breathing and reduced total lung capacity. My doctor then told me to stop the flovent because my asthma was obviously not causing my symptoms. It 's frustrating because i wish i just had an answer######Also, as to what triggers my attacks... they 're completely random. Before this all happened, my asthma was always triggered by something... allergies, cold air, exercising, etc.. My last attack happened when i was at work (i sit down all day and have never had an asthma attack there before) My shortness of breath just got progressively worse throughtout the day. It 's scary.######I do have asthma which i think complicates my problem. Sometimes I yawn and I feel that it opens up my lungs more, but only during the yawn. And other times, I ca n't yawn, because there just is n't enough air... it feels like my lungs just wo n't expand..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Lung & Respiratory Disorders/ COPD

I have n't gotten any meds for it yet. . I have to follow up with my pulmonary doctor at the beginning of April. I just have a few questions that I ca n't seem to find the answers to. One, why are they waiting so long to give me any meds? Two, does anyone else feel short of breath ALL THE TIME. . I mean, getting up to do anything leaves me feeling like I just ran a marathon. My heart is pounding and I 'm breathing heavily. I have n't discovered what causes my shortness of breath. I took the methacholine challenge test after complaining of shortness of breath for 2 years, and the technician is the one who told me it 's asthma. Does anyone recommend seeing an allergist to see if staying away from certain things would be beneficial? Is it normal that I quit smoking 2 years ago and am just NOW developing asthma? All my chest xrays came back clear. My breathing test and methacholine challenge test are consistant with asthma. I could n't get any real answers from the person performing my test, so I figured I 'd try here. I 'm sorry if this makes no sense.######Well, the doctor has to prescribe the meds not the technician who gave you the test. I suppose that 's the soonest he could see you? And yes, if you have asthma and are on no medication you will most likely have trouble breathing all the time. It might be helpful to get allergy testing. Do you have any allergies that you know of? And smoking- or not smoking- has nothing to do with getting asthma. Asthma in adults is generally caused by a particular pneumonia virus or some other event- exposure to some chemical, etc.. Asthma does not show up on chest x rays. Also, there is no cure for asthma so you will be on some sort of meds for the remainder of your life. Be sure to use them as instructed. When you see your pulmonologist make sure to get a written plan for controlling your asthma: 1) What you are to do each day (meds, etc) 2) What you are do if you get sick with a cold or other upper respiratory illness 3) What to do before any cardio exercise if you are in a habit of working out, etc 4) What to do if you have an attack This will help you get your asthma under control and know what to do in the event something goes haywire... which it will eventually. It happens to all of us. Bad weather, a cold, bad alelrgy attack, something will set it off and you 'll need to know what to do to adjust your meds until it passes. Good luck!.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I have a family history of it (maternal grandma and an uncle on my mom's side) but have n't had ay symptoms until within the past 3-4 moths. I know no one here can diagnose me but I 'd like to know your opinions of whether or not my doctor seems on the right track with this. Here 's a little history: In the past 4 months I 've had an upper respiritory infection and pneumonia. It seems like my lungs have n't recovered yet. I get tightness in my chest and shortness of breath. It feels like my lungs just get tired of breathing. I 've been on an albutoral inhaler for about 2 months now, which does n't seem to be working. At my doctors appointment last week, the doctor told me suddenly that I have asthma and gave me a perscription for Pulmicort (which does n't seem to be working yet, either). The reason I 'm asking for your opinion is because my doctor never gave me any lung function tests or anything like that. I 'm a little curious as to how she came to that conclusion. Can it be diagnosed just by the symptoms presented and by listening to the lungs? I do n't feel like I 'm getting any relief for this. Even as I 'm typing this my chest feels tight and I feel short of breath and I 've just taken both of my asthma meds. I would appreciate any feedback on this. Thank you ~ Amelia######Well i 've heard about a bacterial infection of the lungs called Chlamydia pneumoniae (different than the sexually transmitted disease strand of bacteria). Apparently it can cause asthma if one is to get infected with it through a cold or pneumoniae. It 's a touchy subject that is just starting to be investigated but i 'm to understand that if one takes the right antibiotics he/she may be able to do away with their supposed asthma. I may self never tried it because I have has asthma since i was born, rather than getting it after any type of illness. Google Asthma Story and i site will come up which is all about a guy who cured his asthma by getting rid of the bacteria. Good Luck, and I would n't be so quick to listen to your doctor they are often misinformed in my opinion.######Lung function tests are n't always accurate- maybe your doctor decided to diagnose you based on other factors? Especially for nonallergic asthma- I 've been told that those tests only work for allergic asthma. How often are you using the albuterol? It is only a rescue drug, you know- you may need a long term preventative medication in addition to a rescue medication. Are you seeing a family doc or an asthma specialist?######It is true about the pneumonia strain causing asthma. That 's how I ended up with it. However, antibiotocs wo n't help if you are over the infection. The damage will have already been done. Go see a pulmonologist, get tested and get on the appropriate meds for you. I was a lot better once I did that.######Well, it is n't a common practice to do away with asthma using antibiotics. One must use extremely high doses of antibiotics for a long period of time to do it. The reason being is that even though one may feel better, with the exception of the asthma, there is still bacteria that remains in one's lungs causing the asthma. This is just one theory and as i said it is only now being tested, but researchers have found higher amounts of chlamadyia in asthmatics than non asthmatics. So if one has gotten asthma from some sort of illness i would suggest looking into this. As i said before, i was born with asthma so it probly would n't do much for me.######Gabby2007- Well I have allergies, does that mean that this would be allergic asthma or not necesarily? I 'm using the albutoral at least once a day, sometimes twice. My doctor has me taking Pulmicort as well. She just put me on it during last week's appointment but so far it does n't seem to make a differance. But I think maybe it takes a week or so before you feel the effects? And I 'm just seeing my regular family doctor right now. I 've never even heard of a pulmonologist until now lol. Thanks everyone for all of your help. I appreciate it. My next appointment with the doc in on Dec 3rd and I 'm sure I 'll have a ton of questions for her. Thanks again. ~ Amelia######It depends on whether or not your allergies cause asthma syptoms. For example if your allergic to dust mites but only get itchy watery eyes and no form of chest tightness, shortness of breathe, etc.. Than i 'd say it 's not allergic asthma. Do n't take my word as law though i 'm not a doctor but i have had asthma my entire life.######Since you have a family history of asthma, it 's more likely that you have allergic asthma. Of course, it is possible to have both allergic and non allergic asthma. Childhood onset tends to be allergic, while adult onset is more often non allergic. Of course, there are exceptions... You could go see an allergy/asthma doctor- s/he would probably be better at the allergic form, could give skin tests, etc for allergies. I see a pulmonologist, since I do n't have allergies. One of my triggers is talking- really, using my voice at all (singing, laughing, etc). I used to sing in church services (not special music- just with everyone else)- not any more. Even after I 've used my rescuer, I still wind up coughing. The rescuer does let me talk normally, though, which is nice.######Thanks for all your replies. You 've been a big help. ~ Amelia.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

Most of the time it hits me when I am talking on the phone. I even had someone ask me if I was having an asthma attack when I was talking to them on the phone. I would appreciate any responses. Thank you Becky######As well as a running nose, itchy eyes and skin, bronchospasm is also part of an allergic reaction or can be and this is what causes the shortness of breath and wheezing. The bronchial tubes narrow so that you ca n't get enough air and you also get wheezing too. So yes, in short, allergies can cause shortness of breath most definitely.######I quit smoking before & I could n't stand everything that went with it, so I went back to it. I had talked to my Dr. & she said when you quit, you 're going to feel like you might just die sometimes with shortness of breath & coughing spasms & such. It 's your body getting rid of all the built up toxins, which it could n't for however long you 've been smoking because the chemicals in smoke paralyze your cilia. So, my unprofessional opinion is that it 's the smoking cessasion & probably allergies too that are making you miserable.######I had just went to the Allergist a week ago, I have 2 children with allergies on meds and I noticed such a big difference with them, I decided to go and get checked. I knew I had allergies, constantly stuffy-itchy eyes, post nasal drip- etc.... Well when I went I was totally surprised: along with many allergies I have asthma. When he started to check me out, he said do you always wheeze and have labored breathing ?? I had no clue: until now many things make sense. (I had moved into a new house just over a year with 2 sets of stairs. I can not do them both in sequence without huffing and puffing. (I thought I was just out of shape) If I have to run from one floor to the next to get the phone, I could hardly talk, huffing and puffing (everyone commented). I had went to my family doctor about a year ago, He said I was having anxiety attacks, (I went because I would have bouts of shortness of breath-there are alot of heart problems in my family so I wanted to get checked), put me on zoloft, I did take for 6 months and it laid me back a bit but really made no difference. I got off after six months and just dealt with it, I had went through some heart tests and everything was ok, so I really was n't worried.) Had no clue that it may be asthma ?? After a breathing test at the doctor he confirmed Yes indeed I have asthma. I would encourage you to be checked. I always had a hard time on the phone too, and everyone commented (``what are you doing '', Why are you so out of breath? '') My daughter has asthma, but You know when she is having an attack I did n't for once thing that was my problem.######Allergies can definitely cause shortness of breath! I 've never had allergy problems until recently and have had shortness of breath along with them. I have always had asthma but it has very rarely ever bothered me except when I gave birth to my son after all the hard breathing but then it went away and re-surfaced with my allergies. I 'm sure it probably has a lot to do with your quitting smoking. That is a good thing, though, it 's good for your health to not smoke, If the symptoms do n't subside you might check with an allergist just to be sure (This message has been edited by VNC21402 (edited 01-07-2003) .).######-Health Issues###-Allergies

I have both Asthma (Cough variant) and GERD. My asthma is caused by a lifetime of environmental allergies (64 YO). I have also been diagnosed with ``silent '' GERD. When I have to bend over for any reason I get short of breath. No dizziness, but I have to take a break between tying each shoe. I am slightly over weight (5 ' 6 '' and 175) but otherwise fit. Does anyone else out there have this problem. Thanks in advance.######It could be that bending over compresses your chest and gives your lungs next space. Or, it could be that bending over allows acid to run up your esophagus and irritate your throat and lungs. Or it could be something else.######I second everything Jane said. The GERD/Asthma combination can form a viscious cycle sometimes.######Another thing to rule out would be a heart condition. When you bend over, you put pressure on your heart, which could cause breathing problems.######I 've had the same shortness of breath when bending over. For me, this is often an early indicator that my asthma is getting out of control- it can take several minutes just to put on shoes, and trying to pick something off the floor can be very challenging. Walking upstairs knocks the wind out of me. Other asthma symptoms such as constant difficulty breathing and coughing may not begin for days or weeks after the bending symptoms. I also have acid reflux & I 'm close in age & physical condition to you. My asthma doctor told me each patient may experience different asthma symptoms (or combinations of symptoms) & the sooner you can recognize them occurring the sooner you can begin appropriate treatment to prevent or minimize an asthma attack. I had extensive tests of heart, lungs, blood, etc which ruled out other causes so my doctor felt positive my symptoms were asthma related. Is your shortness of breath when bending over relatively new or have you experienced this for a long time? Please discuss this with your doctor if you have n't already done so because your shortness of breath needs proper diagnosis/treatment. It 's taken time and frequent medication/dosage changes to find what works best for me on treating asthma, but it 's now reasonably well under control and I 'm quick to alert my doctor if my symptoms begin to flare up..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

About 20 a day. I 've been taking them for about 3 years now. I know I need to stop, but that 's a different story, different thread. I know this is very bad for my health, I know I 'm just killing my body. I 've always had a mild case of allergy-induced asthma. I never have full blown attacks, but have tight chest feeling and not being able to get a good breath in. It usually comes about once a year, about this time a year when my allergies are at it 's worse. Usually it lasts a few days. Well, this little episode this time has lasted about 2 1/2 weeks. I know it says in the warnings with the medication to stop taking if you experience shortness of breath. It also has a million other reasons to stop taking. Now I 'm wondering if I 'm just experiencing the usual asthma problems, or can painkillers cause major breathing problems? I just want to hear from those who may have experienced this. I plan to go to the doctor anyway, I 've just had a few busy weeks. So basically just wondering if there is a connection between opiates and respritory problems?######My understanding is hydros suppress breathing and should never, ever be taken by someone with asthma unless they are closely monitored, the dosage is minimal, and they are taken for a very short period of time.######From past experience, hydros do contribute to asthma. I have asthma (under control with medication) and have experienced acute asthma attacks while on pain meds. And that 's at the doctor's recommended dose. Be careful, it 's very difficult to get the attacks under control once they 've started. Please talk to your doctor.######Wow, thank you both. It 's funny because I 've never considered myself an asthmatic and never check that box when filling out health forms. Just because I 've never had an attack and I only have these ``flare ups '' once a year or so. I think now that I 've gained some weight, I need to watch it-I understand if you 're not in shape it can make it worse. I wonder why it 's all of a sudden happening when I 've been taking them for 3 years? Thank you both for your input and I 'll get to the doctors!.######-Mental Health Board###-Addiction & Recovery

Now i 'm having alot of trouble finding a job as it is, if i do n't get a job my mother's boyfriend will kick me out of the house. The problem is i ca n't find a good enough solution for CU to keep it from flaring up during activity. I am almost certain if i get a job i will be suffering from CU all day. The problem is for me it can causes nausea and headaches, Shortness of breath, and painful needly-feeling itchiness. It 's nearly impossible to even focus. The allergist i spoke with says since it is n't life threatening, i should be fine to work with symptoms, but i find that i ca n't do that, it is far too debilitating for me. Has anyone else had a problem like this?######Do you take drug treatment on regular basis for protective effect? Have you been diagnosed with asthma, too?######Yes i take Fexofenadine and Ranitidine (Acid Reliever) I do not have asthma######I asked you about having asthma, cause it is well known that people having cholinergic urticaria, usually have asthma, too. Acctually, asthma can be triggered with an urticaria attack. Patients who are more severely affected with cholinergic urticaria may experience systemic symptomatology, such as fainting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nausea, salivation, and headaches (I guess that 's your case, because your have more symptoms, not just the rush and prickling skin sensation) Nausea, can be experienced as a side effect of using Fexofenadine, too. If you continue to have symptoms that impair with your ability to function, despite treatment with high doses of antihistamines (your doctor can increase the dosage), talk with your doctor about prescribing other drugs, like danazol.

After getting out of the hospital I starting having severe migraines and spent the next 6 months visiting specialist to figure out what was wrong with me and how to control the migraines. Has anyone else ever had this or heard of it as a side effect. It 's been 13 years since I had meningitis. I also ended up with a food allergy after having meningitis. The food allergy is actually the trigger for my migraines.######I had meningtis (meningaccocal septacemia) about 6 years ago.I still have reaccuring pain in my head, in the same place a had the pain when i was so ill (its like a stabbing pain, just in one place. I am so forgetful all the time. Since my i llness i have now an under active thyroide, i dont know if this is connected! I have found this site really helpful, just reading other peoples experiences.######3 years ago this month I was very ill with meningitis and I still suffer on occassions with great pain in my head, I am very forgetful and I am unable to concentrate for long periods. My family and I feel that I should be over this by now and it has got me down- since finding this site I now feel I have a better understanding of this illness and how it affects each individual differently and I know I have been lucklier than others which I am grateful for- I would like to know ways of helping myself to cope/deal with this better, and ways of knowing if/when I 'm getting better are there any medical tests available for people like me######At age 3 I had meningococcal meningitis. The first migraine I can remember was at the age of 10. I am now 29 yrs old and still get them. Could this be from the meningitis I had as a child.######I went to Mayo clinic in Rochester MN to try to find answers concerning recurrent viral meningitis. I have had meningitis three confirmed times with hospital stays each time. Severe pain. Scans, MRI's, blood serum, angiograms all negative. With this I also have chronic migraines. Mayo clinic linked my meningitis to the migraines. It is rare, but there are confirmed cases. The key for me is to stop the migraines, and therefore stop the meningitis. I have exhausted Neuro's and internet searches. Best outlook for me is to keep my bag packed for the next hospital stay. There is no cure for this. There are no specialists.######wow, this is the first time I know of anyone else having recurrent meningitis.I 'm 57 and have had 6 cases (the first actually equine strain encephalitis) of confirmed viral meningitis. I started getting migraines 15 years ago. very rotten business and I feel for you. I did knock down the migraine frequency to once a month (or 3 in two months) and duration from several days to 2. Magnesium, 400 mg riboflavin, and progesterone cream, are minimum requirements now. And of course I really upped any supplyment that increases immunity (vit c, garlic, good vitamins, enough sleep, and good food)######I had tarted having migraines in my 30's and had meningitis at age 16 (bacterial) I think it is related. I never noticed being forgetful until I took Topamax. . for prevention.######I take propanonol for migraine daily therapy and love it. I tried to take Topamax and it gave me a bad reaction. I have tried all the other meds too and I was really tired the next day. Ask your doc about propanonol. It does lower your blood pressure too so look at that as well. Good luck!######I had bacterial meningitous when i was 16 and now am in my 30; s. I had the extreme pain in the head and rash. At first the docters kept asking if i was sexual active and that maybe it was linxed to that. After a painful spinal tap it was confirmed bacterial meningitous. I was hospitalized for a week and then continued with home care for another week, i never had headaches before hand but i find since the meningitous i have severe migraines normally on my right side. The doctor says it has nothing to do with the meningitous but sometime I wonder if they are linked. I am now getting the migraines on the right, they go away and within days the migraine moves to the left side and eventually all over.######I had meningitis when i was 7, both viral and baterial, one after the other, it 's 12 years later and i still get migraines and right temple pain now, the doctor said theyr not linked but i had severe migraines while i had it... just living with it since the drug they gave me made me fat and depressed: S######I had viral meningitis when I was 12 and at the age of 16 I was diagnosed with chronic migraines. I was curious if they are in anyway related.######Hi fellow survivors, I had viral meningitis in July 2010 and was in hospital for 10 days. Until recently I thought the only side effect was an my inability to recall common words, which only happens occasionally. BUT I was released from hospital yesterday after being admitted for 12 days with a chronic migraine. It was almost exactly the same symptoms as the meningitis. The neurologist that saw me said he believed that it was directly linked to the trauma to the brain last July. He put me on a low dose of endep every night which is meant to act as a preventative. wish me luck with that !!!! Quick question: does anybody know of good websites about migraines and treatment etc, you google and come up with thousands so. Hariel######Dear Hariel, I am just now finding this site and your post. I had viral meningitis from the Flu in Feb. 1997. On Sept 29,1999 I got the migraine from hell and have had maybe 20 migraine free days since. I had the ``million dollar '' work-up- all negative. My husband is a board certified family physician and a fellow with the AAFP. He was convinced that there is a connection, altho the neurologists do n't think so. I 've been to Thomas Jefferson Headache Clinic in Philadelphia where the hyerspecialist could n't help. Everything works for a few weeks or months and then stops working. The triptans gave me stroke-like symptoms, so I ca n't take those. We did hear one Neurologist lecture on headache and stated a very definite connection between history of menningitis and chronic daily migraine, but offered no real helpful treatment. I stay active and functional and happy despite the pain that would stop most people only because I have no choice, and I know I am blessed with a wonderful husband who would move heaven and earth to relieve it if he could and two great children (now adults) who are the joy of my life. I love my God with all my heart and have a deep abiding faith and hope in Him. I KNOW there is a connection between menningitis and daily migraine- I am proof. I also know that it is possible to deal with it- I am proof of that, too. I will pray for you and others who suffer as we do. Melanie######Melanie, Thank you for sharing your story. In 1999 I also had viral meningitis and my first headache from ``hell ''. From that day until now I 've had only a handful of days each year where I 've been migraine-free. I have an incredibly supportive husband and 3 wonderful children who keep me going everyday. I pray for the day that my head will no longer be in pain. But after years of seeing every doctor, specialist, and everything between I have accepted the fact that pain is a part of my daily life. I thought I was alone in this journey... I 'm sorry you 're going through this too but it 's also nice to know someone understands my world. Again... Thanks for sharing. . , Alisha######My wife has just finished her 2nd issue with meningitis and ever since her 1st one in 99, she has migraines daily. Most times they are controlled by Butterbur (natural stores carry this) and when it gets real bad, she uses Excedren Migraine. She is worried that her stomach is going to ulcer with constant doses, so we have looked for other options. The doctors thought at first that it was hormonal, so she underwent a partial. That did n't help! Then she went to a pain specialist, who referred her to a neurologist. A botox shot to the base of the skull took the pain away for about a week. We are lost and just need to find something for her. I did n't realize this was such a major problem. It makes staying employed a difficult task too when you ca n't be out in the light or ca n't stop vomitting. I too am glad to see that this is n't an isolated incident. Please keep me updated as to any break throughs you have. Butterbur, Spark with O2 Gold and rehydrate also work if you have a friend that sells Advocare. We have been using it since 2008 and it helps, but they never really go away. Good Luck! Mike and Lillian######I just found this website and I too had both bacterial and viral meningitis. I spent 7 days in intensive care for the viral meningitis and almost died. I was 19 at the time and 26 when I had the bacterial meningitis. I have suffered from migraines from the time I was 26. It never even occurred to me there could be a link. Does anyone know if any studies are done to confirm the link? I have at the least 2 migraines a month if not more.######Hi all. I had aseptic meningitis where they could not find a cause. I too almost died & my life has never been the same. I just wanted to say that now after 11 years of searching for answers to all the crazy symptoms I 've had, I finally had a doctor who by chance tested me for a specific co-infection to Lyme disease caused by a tick bite. The infection is called human monocytic ehrlichiosis or ehrlichia chaffeenosis and all the symptoms fit the intense meningitis I had. I had a severe migraine and spinal swelling every day for over a year and then it slowly tapered off after that over another year. If I did n't find a compassionate doctor to address the migraines, throwing up, nausea, and pain at the time... I would n't have wanted to live; it was that bad. I 've had long lasting affects from the infection that the doctor said turned into Fibromyalgia, but really was from the Lyme disease. I am on a complicated protocol of antibiotics and supplements. I did n't get better because I wa n't treated long enough with an antibiotics at the initial hospitalization. Many of my neurologic symptoms have disappeared with the right treatment although I still have symptoms I 'm trying to manage. I just thought I 'd post my story in case anyone wants to consider the possibility that their meningitis may have been caused by Lyme or a co-infetion. Lyme is called the great imitator because it can mimic many other diseases. It can be misdiagnosed as MS, ALS, tumors etc. on MRIs. If you are interested in exploring more info on Lyme, you can private message me. 50% of patients do not remember a tick bite, nor a rash like myself. Getting the right tests done are really important as most of the tests doctor use today are not accurate enough, so getting treatment by a Lyme literate doctor is essential and testing from the right lab. It may be a long shot, but maybe it 's a possibility to look into. Best wishes..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

You can google ``differential diagnosis, meningitis '' & go through the list of possibilities. The reason I suggest this is that I had severe meningitis 12 years ago where I was bed ridden for over a year. My doctor kept trying to just treat the symptoms & when they did n't go away he said I had fibromyalgia. I finally found a doctor who treated patients with fibro & after tests found I had lyme disease. The co-infection ehrlichia was probably the reason why the meningitis was so severe. Lyme can mimic many other disorders, so it one of the illnesses that should be on your differential list. (Although I must tell you that you will have to have the right lab tests done & most doctors are not aware that the typical tests are not that accurate. Do a little studying on why there is controversy over lyme tests & find a lyme literate doctor & a good lab.) The effects of meningitis can be devastating and sometimes long lasting like mine. I would encourage you to seek a doctor who is compassionate in treating meningitis & pain. A neurologist would be a doctor I would get an opinion from. Keep looking for answers & solutions & never give up. When one doctor ca n't help, or tells you it is all in your head, find another one. You may have to be patient and try many different meds before you find the right combo for you. Best wishes.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

The fever lasted for 10 days where it did not exceed 102 after the 4th day and 100 after the 6th. If I had bacterial meningitis and did not go to the doctor would I notice something? What would the disabilities be? What would the differences be between a normal person and a person that had permanent damage? How long does bacterial meningitis last if left untreated? If I had viral meningitis, was it severe enough to have caused even the slightest permanent damage maybe brain damage? Would I notice it? How? How bad would it have to be? How common is it that viral meningitis caused permanent damage? Explain because I am worried after being really sick. Thank you.######overtak3n: Did you vomit or have diarreha? Was your neck stiff? Could you classify your headache as the worst you 've ever had? How lethargic were you? Bacterial Meningitis is very serious and can QUICKLY lead to death, so I 'm thinking it probably was n't that. Usually, from my understanding if it were another type of Meningitis, the headache would get so bad you 'd be at the hospital in misery. You mentioned you have been experiencing some kind of brain damage? What are you experiencing and how would you describe it? If you are really concerned, I would go see a neurologist. They can tell from tests if the tissue around the brain & spine are inflammed. You can discuss your symptoms. Best wishes, CharlieJane######I was asking what the symptoms would be if I had brain damage. No vomiting, diarrhea started late and lasted for about a day or 2 and was n't as bad. No stiff neck.

I hope right now I have 100% fully recovered.######Hi overtak3n, I am sorry to hear that you have struggled. I do n't know the symptoms of brain damage.

At that time I was told my iron level was 118 with normal range being from 120-261. Another doctor who had the same results, quoted my level to be 8. I think they were referring to two different things. Is one ferritin and the other iron? I am confused. Anyway, after being on iron for three months, I had more bloodwork and was told that my level was now 16. I am assuming that this is good news. Does anyone know what these numbers mean, and what the normal range is? I am totally lost here!######It sounds as if the 8 and 16 are referring to the Ferritin. This number reflects the storage of iron and is usually the ``gold standard '' test for iron deficiency. Do not confuse low or ``deficient '' iron levels with anemia. One can be very low in iron and not anemic. However, very low iron levels over time can lead to anemia. Iron Deficiency Anemia is one of the most common forms of anemia especially in menstruating women. It is usually very easy to correct with simple iron supplements. The fact that your Ferritin level has already risen by 8 points is a very good indication of your ability to respond to the supplements. Althouth 16 is still considered ``low '' is it not classified as ``deficient. '' Once your Ferritin level falls below 10 it reflects a lack of adequate storage to contribute to replenishing your blood supply on a regular basis and can lead to anemia. I would guess you are no longer anemic? Check your Hgl score. This should be 12-15 for women although 11 is considered normal for some. Hope this helps.######The numbers that you quoted sound more like Serum Iron which is the larger numbers, and Hemoglobin which are the lower numbers. The serum iron level is how much iron is available in the blood. The hemoglobin is how much oxygen is carried in the blood by the red blood cells. The Ferritin level is the amount of stored iron that is held in reserve over the amount needed on a daily basis to provide iron to the blood. It is all confusing, but if you have a diet that is adequate in iron nutrients then the supplement is quite enough. Usually, there has to be a disease process going on to keep iron supplements from being adequate.######Thank you both for responding! It is so nice to be able to depend on these boards for answers. I do n't know what I 'd do without it!.######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

Given the results of my tests (below), am I anemic or just iron deficient? Any insight would be wonderful since I wo n't be seeing the doctor again until early September. Thanks in advance. Lab results: Hemoglobin: 123 (120-150) Hematocrit: 0.36 (0.35-0 .45) MCV: 84 (82-98) Iron level: 8L (10-30) Iron Binding Capacity: 68 (45-75) Iron Saturation: 12L (14-50)######You are iron deficient but not yet anemic.

If you have anemia, you do not have iron deficiency. All of your ``iron '' numbers look great. All of it. In iron deficiency anemia, TIBC is either high or high-normal.

I took iron twice a day and started to feel better, but after six months I was sick of taking it and stopped and started feeling really tired again. . I had a physical 2 months ago and felt pretty bad (like before), but I had a new dr and she said I was never anemic in the first place. . she said I just had low iron levels. That 's iron deficiency anemia. . right? She told me to stop taking iron (which is dumb b/c I was n't taking it then anyways) so I have n't taken any iron. . and I feel so tired. Is she just wrong ????######I think you can have low iron and still have high enough hemoglobin and hematocrit to not be anemic. But, if your iron is low, I would think you are bound to become anemic because iron is necessary for the synthesis of hemoglobin. Not sure. Someone on here knows much more than me.######You can be iron deficient without being anemic. I frequently fall into this category-- however, I often tumble into full fledged anemia due to the chronic deficient state. Many women carry very low iron stores-- especially athletes. As it was explained to me ``normal '' iron stores (ferritin) run 10-220. You 're ``low '' in iron when the level drops below 20. You 're ``deficient '' in iron when it drops below 10. Once the level is < 10 your body does n't have enough iron in storage to adequately maintain your blood supply (Hgl, Hct etc. scores drop.) Many people carry very low iron stores BUT are able to maintain a healthy blood supply as they are able to keep it there. Where many of us on this board have difficulty is in the maintenance of an adequate supply of iron. Either we loose it too quickly for our body to replace fast enough OR we ca n't absorb enough from our diets in the first place. If my level STAYED at 10 or 12 I 'd not become anemic (usually anemia sets in after levels have been below 10 for quite some time.) My levels rarely stay above a 10 for very long and I eventually return to an anemic state. This info came from my hematologist and from anything I could read in the medical journals-- hope it helps!

I took feosol for several months, and felt some better so tapered off in taking it, because of stomach upset. I recently started feeling more wiped out and went to the doctor. My hemoglobin was normal 12.5, however I had started back on my iron about a week before. Could that affect the results of the hemoglobin? Also, my ferritin levels were sent off, I have n't got the results yet. Is it possible to have normal hemoglobin and still have low ferritin? To the point of feeling totally horrible? I mean totally horrible...... Thanks######In a word YES. I suffer with low ferritin levels (whilst my hb is normally okay), but i suffer all the same symptoms with low ferritin as I did when i was IDA (hb went back to normal following a course of iron infusions- but my ferritin continues to stay low. Accordinging to my heamatologist its what is medically known as ferropenic anemia.######I am not sure that one would feel differently whether or not the ferritin is low because it is stored iron and is not utilized by the body directly for energy. But, If the hemoglobin was at normal and a dose of iron had been taken just before the blood test it might make the hemaglobin appear normal when it is not sustained normal. A CBC is just a point in time. The reason I know this is because when I became severely anemic, the doctor was taking a CBC every week and the numbers were different each time but in a range of below normal until after the Iron infusion..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

Hemoglobin was 123. I started taking Ferrous Succinate 25 mg daily for three months, stopped it for one month to see if my body would hold the iron, and now I just got another ferritin test because I was feeling worse. Well, turns out my ferritin is now down to 10 and hemoglobin is down to 119. Could this mean the supplement was n't working, or do I have to give it more time? Thanks! \* BeautyofSpeed \*######You did n't have your ferritin built up enough to be able to stop the iron. You want to get your ferritin to at leasts 50 before you try to stop supplements. For a healthy ferritin you want to raise it even more somewhere between 70-100. Whenever there is not enough iron for use, your body pulls from the ferritin storage and uses that up. This is what happened to you. Did you ever find the reason for the low ferritin? This has to be fixed or will never be able to hold onto the iron. You can not use more iron than you are able to take in. You also might not be taking enough iron, ask your doctor about this if it is a concern. FLFLOWERGIRL######I agree with FLFLOWERGIRL. Your ferritin was low, you took a very low-dose supplement for someone with such low ferritin. So, after 3 months, it probably only went up a few points anyway. Then you stopped and your body used more iron storage up because whatever is causing this has not stopped. My opinion-- you need to figure out what is the problem (heavy bleeding), and stay on a higher dose of iron for a longer period of time. You can take your regular supplement but you probably need at least 3 of them a day.######I only took it for three months, and then stopped for a month because my naturopath wanted me to do that and see if my body would ``hold '' the iron. So, I 'm back on the supplements. I 'm not sure that 25 mg of ferrous succinate will be sufficient though. I 'm not really sure I want to take the other form of iron (gluconate and sulfate) because of the constipating/GI issues factor. I 'm hoping my naturopath will shed some light on things, because I 've pretty much given up on my doctor. The fact that my ferritin was 17 in Feb and she told me to ``add more iron to my diet '', obviously very unconcerned, has caused distrust on my part towards her (my doctor). I have been begging her, pleading with her, crying to her since 2006 now about my fatigue and inability to lose weight after eating right and exercising 4x weekly. All she tells me is-- up your exercise to 1 hour of cardio 5x weekly. But does she even consider maybe I physically am to exhausted to even do that with a ferritin of 10 ????? anyway, that 's about it...######You can take more than the one tablet of ferrous succinate. The dosage you are taking now (25 mg) is more for someone who has a healthy iron range and is just trying to maintain. You need far more to try to build your iron stores and elevate your hemoglobin. Have you determined what is causing this? The body does n't not ``hold '' iron for no reason. Your are losing blood (too much) from somewhere. If that is not corrected, then stopping iron supplements to see if it ``holds '' is kind of setting yourself up for failure. I can understand why you might be frustrated with your regular doctor but many will not treat if you are within normal values and at 17 ferritin, you are normal by medical standards. I know that, here on this list, we KNOW that 's not the whole story. But, I do think that your naturopath is also doing you a disservice by: 1) not getting to the root of the problem 2) not prescribing enough iron, and 3) thinking it is okay to stop to see if you ``hold '' the iron when the issue has not been resolved. There is never no reason to have low iron. You just do n't have that. Anemia and iron deficiency are a result of a problem.######Actually my ferritin level is 10. I have n't been able to actually speak with either my doctor or my naturopath since I found out my ferritin went down to 10. This is because I always get the lab to send me my results in the mail (that 's how I know my ferritin is 10 now). I have a doctor's appointment coming up on September 3. So yes, I agree, I have to find out what is causing the low iron in the first place. I feel the worst I have ever felt. and the more ironic thing about this is that I am finally free of antidepressants after 10 years of being on them (went off in December 2007), so I felt like I was finally getting my life/health back. I am wondering if that is part of the problem with the low iron... has anyone else ever had any correlation with iron levels and antidepressants? Thanks! \* BeautyofSpeed \*######My ferritin is 7. I still do n't know what my cause is either. I will say that I think the correlation between antidepressants and anemia is that it is pretty depressing to be anemic! I do n't think it is the pills causing anemia, but anemia causing a need for antidepressants !!

On my lab results, it also says `less than 5 ' for ferritin levels. I 'd always presumed that maybe my levels were 4 or something, maybe lower. Now I do wonder why there 's no exact number given. Is it true that it 's simply because it 's so low they could n't give an exact number?######I think it depends upon the lab doing the testing. I 've gotten actual values less than 5 before. I often earn a 3. I doubt any of these numbers are written in stone. Any blood counts are subject ot variations but generally give a good idea of what may be going on. Ferritin levels below 10 indicate that your body no longer carries enough iron in storage to adequately replenish your blood supply. This can lead to anemia if not addressed and corrected. Taking iron supplements will usually do the trick providing there is no disease process responsible.######I had posted earlier about my ferritin level being ``less than 5. '' This was in September and the last ferritin level taken had been in January, and was 1.0. My friend works at the lab where the test was done (in fact she draws my blood in her house before work and just takes the vials with her along with dr request for lab work; very convenient !!!!) She said that my ferritin level had obviously gone ``below 1.0 '' and was now undetectable. I just took her word for it since she has been a lab tech for over 20 yrs. I still have not had an iron infusion as my gastro is concerned about me having a severe reaction. Personally, I would like not to feel zombified on a 24/7 basis due to absolutely zero energy.######For the last year my ferritin levels have n't been above 5 mostly 1 or below and it comes back with an actual number on mine so I am not sure about the reading saying that it is less than 5 probably like the other poster said it depends on the lab.######There 's little difference between ferritin levels of 1, 3 or 5. Ferritin is simply an indicator of a potential problem and a low value in and of itself should not cause symptoms. What causes problems is if you develop anemia as a result of prolonged periods of iron deficiency. I 'm ALWAYS iron deficient BUT I 'm not always anemic. There is a HUGE difference between iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency. Many, many women are iron deficient usually as a result of their monthly cycles which can be draining (literally!) BUT, if you can continue to absorb enough iron thru your diet or supplements suggested by your doctor most of the time anemia can be avoided. Hope this info helps. There are generally a limited number of health issues that cause iron deficiency anemia and they are usually easy to pinpoint. I went thru all the tests and my problem seems to stem from a lack of proper absorption. I used to get IV iron to help with this but due to delevloping violent allergies to the drugs used this is no longer an option for me. I find that if I 'm diligent about my diet and lead a healthy lifestyle (plenty of sleep, exercise, etc) I can usually keep my Hgl and Hct levels within range.######Great information! I never had problems with anemia until I developed connective-tissue disease. Even then, my levels were not that low (hematocrit, hemoglobin, ferritin, etc.) Then, over a period of about a year I became severely anemic. But the time the cause was detected, my hemoglobin was in the ``5's. '' Hematocrit was 19. Turns out I had developed abdominal ``bleeding angiodysplasias, '' which is ``leaky, tangled blood vessels. '' I 've had 3 blood transfusion since then, but my counts always start to drop again albeit gradually. (this condition is chronic). Iron pills did not help at all. My last lab work showed HGB at 9.8 and HCT at 31. I guess I will have ``annual '' blood transfusion some time next year. It is frustrating, but I know it could be worse.######Wow, there seems to be so many reasons behind anemia. I have never heard of your diagnosis, notsonutso. That has to be hard. I went off my iron pills today per my dr's request. I had to go into the office with severe stabbing, upper left abdominal pain, and he said sometimes iron can do that. But we are going to do a catscan just in case (did I spell that right, lol). But with that he is also doing more blood work, so I am curious how my iron level is now that I have been taking the supplement for about a month.

Does it work? as it is expensive but I am getting really desperate now Thanks######Hello shania, Welcome to this forum and the wonderful people who post here and try to help each other. I can not give you any advice regarding hypnotherpy unfortunately. You state ``they wo n't give me a scan yet ''. Do I understand correctly that your doctors have not okayed for you to have X-rays and an MRI scan? If that is the case, then I will highly recommended that you see a highly respected neurologist/spinal surgeon and have them authorize for you to have an MRI. Without an MRI and X-rays the doctors are just going to be guessing. Do search out the very best neurologist/spinal surgeon that you can find in your area. Please do correct me if I do not understand your post correctly. Take care. RichT######Hi Rich, Many thanks for the reply. I live in the UK so we get our heathcare under the NHS system. As it is tax payers money it is very political. My X ray came back normal so I was fobbed off for a bit even though my physio wanted me to get an MRI If the pain clinic ca n't help me then I may get refered to a specialist to get on the waiting list for an MRI. I may get one done privately as after all this time I still do not know for sure what is wrong and it is affecting my attendance at work.

Without one influence of our vagus nerve called ``vagus tone '', our resting heartbeat, would be around 115 bpm. Vagus tone slows it down to around 72 bpm. Athletes have increased vagus tone and much lower resting heart beats than people that are out of shape. You do not have to have heart disease to have problems with vasovagal syncope or your vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is the nerve of the muscle in the throat and the larynx, and is the nerve that slows the rate of the heartbeat and supplies the parasympathetic nerves to the lungs, the stomach, the esophagus, and other abdominal organs. Arasympathetic means the nerves pertaining to the autonomic nervous system; the system which is concerned with control of involuntary bodily functions. Stimulating the parasympathetic nerves generally produces; contracts the pupils; causes copious secretion of the saliva; and increases gastrointestinal activity. Usually, when this happens, the heart's ventricles start beating on their own despite continued vagal stimulation. In the moment-to-moment regulation of heart rate at rest, the vagal influence is dominant and, particularly in athletes with low resting heart rates, this `vagal tone ' can be considerable. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is associated with increased nervous system activation and increased heart rate, but one type, hypovolemic hypotension, occurring after hemorrhage or certain drugs, induces a decrease in heart rate. ..######-Heart-Vascular###-Heart Disorders

Florinef helps me to retain water so my blood pressure is more regular (but I have to increase my slat intake too). I am also on a beta-blocker which helps my heart rate to slow down (Atenolol). You could very well have this. But if you pass out that easily then you may have autonomic failure. If you have that then maybe IV fluids once a week could help also, I was receiving them, but they were n't helping me. Of course everyone is different. If I were you I would go to a cardiologist and get evaluated more thoroughly. Hope it helped!######I have a similar problem, after a lot of back and forth (I did n't have obvious triggers and I had a few red herrings) and two tilt tables, both of which came back positive, but with very different reactions, I was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. It took over my life. The funny thing is that I had periods of this in high school, but I had n't had a problem in a long time, my last severe bout was 5 years ago, with just twice yearly episodes in the meantime (an amount I can live with). In addition, I have hypoglycemia, so Dr.'s and family chalked it up to that for so long, until I started measuring sugars concurrent with episodes and was able to document that my sugars were n't low when I was having these. Unfortunately, the midodrine did n't do anything for me (I still passed out several times a day), neither did the florinef. I 'm now on pindolol (a beta blocker) in addition to these other medications and doing daily tilt training, and I 'm out of work for a few weeks. I seem to be doing better, but its tough to tell because everytime I get dizzy, I lay down and put my feet up for as long as it takes, I wo n't have that luxury when I get back to work. I still have daily dizzy episodes and I faint about 1-2 a week even with the adjustments I 've made, I just hope that wo n't translate into even more faints when I get back to work.

When I was younger, my symptoms were much worse, but I still go through periods where it gets very bad. I also suffer from migraines and I feel the two are related. If you have n't already, check out info on POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). If you have POTS, it can effect your entire body. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_orth ostatic_tachycardia_syndrome To be honest, after all this time, I still do n't have a solution for me. I 've tried diet changes, meds, vitamins, etc.. The one thing I have realized is that I can not let it affect me mentally, which can be hard. But I stay positive and hopefull that the next doctor I see will find a good solution for me.######Hi, my 15 year old daughter has also been diagnosed with vaso vagal... tried midon and florinef... both didnt work and made her feel worse... She is a straight A student and used to be a sprinter too but now get the shakes and black spots after running so has to take sport easy now. she recently had her birthday and felt so bad she had to go to bed and didnt even get to blow her candles out on her cake. . I feel that no one can treat this problem. . and its not right that anyone in this day and age has to go through this. I am really angry and i feel like i am banging my head against a brick wall. i just want to help my daughter feel normal.######My 15 year old daughter is going through the same thing. Midodrine is keeping her from passing out but she feels terrible a lot and has had unexplained seizures and has passed out while laying down. She also gets tightness in her chest.I know you wrote this a few years ago and was wondering how your daughter is and if you found any additional info######This sounds exactly like my daughter. Have you found anything that has been helpful?######I was diagnosed a few years ago and I have gone through test after test and the doctors ca n't figure out what is going on with me, the one doctor looked at me saying that there is nothing wrong until one day it happened at his office. He was floored. I asked the nerologist if there is a cure. He said some day there might be. Right now no. I asked what is causing these issues that I deal with, he has no answers. I thought I was the only one that had this problem until I saw this site. I live alone had many trips to the hospital from falling down steps or hitting my head when I blacked out. It really is not right living like this, there has to be someone with answers or a cure.######I am 24 years old and was diagnosed with vaso vagal syncope when I was 5. I had seizures when I was a toddler and then later diagnosed with vaso vagal. I have been put on salt tablets which was just a capsule filled with salt but later taken off because of the amount of salt i consume on a daily basis. I then was put on florinef and I felt like I was having more ``episodes '' while I was on it. I weened myself off the meds because 3 cardiologists could not figure out what was wrong. I now only have maybe 10 episodes a year, granted depending on the heat in the summer. Lately though I have constantly had that lingering dizzy feeling, I am also hypothyroid. I can always tell when I am getting dizzy and when im about to pass out from several years of experience, any ideas what the constant dizzy feeling is from?######I have been dealing with this all of my life I am now 33. I have not found anything that helps. Up until 3 years ago I was able too work and due too passing out and thyroid cancer I am now not able to work. I have gotten to the point that I have to have my son help me cook and take care of his brothers when I am not feeling good. There are days where just getting too the bathroom is an issue because I am dizzy. I hope all of us that have too deal with this will someday be able to function normally. Good Luck...######Hello everyone, my name is Jordan and I am 18 years old I was diagnosed with Vaso Vagal about a year ago, after a year of tests. This November will be my second year with the condition and I go through stages of faiting and for the last couple of months I have been the worst I have ever been. My faints occur up to 3 times a day at the moment and I very rarely know it is going to happen. This makes my life extremley difficult and I am never allowed to be alone. I faint in so many dangerous places and in dangersous situations, as I dont get a warning as to when Im going to faint. At the moment I 'm finding it very hard and have been quite depressed- this forum has showed me that there are other people like me and it isnt unusual to feel that way, so thank you! I am currently in my third year of college attempting to do my A levels and can possibly be doing a fourth year. One of the subjects I am studying is Anthropology and I have decided to do my research on Vaso Vagal Syncope and what help, chatrooms and forums the internet has to offer and what support there is for people like us. If anybody can point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.

I know I had mentioned the few times I felt like I was going to pass out ?? Wel it happened again twice on Thursday and I went to go see my primary care physician she said she was concerned about my low blood pressure and she didnt want me to increase the nortriptyline again till I have gained at least 5lbs and that that 5lbs brings myblood pressure up more... I talked to my neuro-otologist and he said the episodes sound more vaso-vagal and blood pressure related than migraine related... They say with vaso-vagal that i will grow out of it in time cause my blood stems will start to stiffen up and my blood pressure will rise but i mean damn! I had just come to terms with the MAV and trying to beat that and seeing the counselor to control my anxiety and now I am terrified I will pass out everytime I stand up ?? My life is really at an all time low and I just feel like giving up so any advice anyone can give me would be helpful... anyone every suffer from vaso-vagal ?? any tips or comforting advice ??######Hey dizzysal, I 'm sorry to hear that you 've been having a hard time lately. In coming across your post, it reminded me a lot of myself and what I 've been going through. I 've been dealing with dizziness for close to a year and a half now, waiting to see a neurootologist, but I have a strong feeling it may be inner ear related... could be migraines too, who knows. In the last four months, out of no where, I 've also been suffering from very low blood pressure... it drops to the mid 80's/ 50's, i 've even had 79/55 on a really bad day. I also experience a lot of faintness and the low bp definitely worsens my dizziness... when my bp drops too low I often feel so weak that I can barely get out of bed. I 've had a bunch of tests and no one seems to know why I 've been having this out of no where. They also said it might be blood vessel related (possibly orthostatic hypotension) and I should hopefully grow out of it some day, as I 'm only 24 now. I 'm planning on going to a naturopath to find some natural ways to raise my bp... there are steroidal drugs like florinef that can often help bp, but its obviously not a good long term option. Things like licorice extract should help too from what I 've heard. I can help but wonder if low bp can simply be a progression of our dizzy condition. Why didnt we have the low bp in the beginning of our dizzies? You have to wonder if there 's a link!######Please let me know if there are any homeopathic remedies that will help... how do you know how low your blood pressure drops do you have something to check it at home... i really wish i knew how low my pressure is when i am at home laying down just so i know how far it does drop but my hubby wont let me buy a cuff cause i would seriously become neurotic and checking it 24/7.... yeah they said i would grow out of this too as i am only 26. They also seem to think if i break the MAV diet i will put on some wieght and raise my pressure... i started the diet back in march and lost maybe 5lbs and am down to 105lbs now and they are thinking it just screwed my pressure up too much so i need to cheat on my diet a bit besides i never noticed many triggers anyways######Hey, the way I keep track of my bp is buy checking it at the pharmacy near my house when I start feeling weak, lightheaded, etc.. I was thinking of buying a machine to check my bp too but have a feeling it might make me paranoid too... I 'd be checking it non-stop. I also lost some weight over the last few months and wonder if it could be affecting my bp too, but my body should have rebounded from the weight loss by now. Since you 're only 105 pounds you definitely do have some room to gain a little weight, hopefully it 'll be enough to make you feel better. I 've been told that consuming more salt and drinking lots of water should help with low bp, but so far it hasnt made much of a difference for me. You might wan na give it a shot. I 'll definitely let you know if the naturopath I 'm going to has any tips. You might also want to checking out taking licorice extract, but consult your doctor first. I hope it helps !!######hi, i have been dizzy for over only 31/2 months and not sufffering form so much vasovagal but i was in the early months and i can relate and feel your pain. But i also know that nortryptiline can lower your bp sustancially specially if you are so underweight see if your Gp or Dr seing you can modify maybe the medication dosis (lower it) to control your migrane and at the same time not affect so much your vessels. . sometimes may be better to change medication to other things like topamax or something else. . good luck..######-Otolaryngology###-Inner Ear Disorders

Four months ago I was diagnosed with shingles on the left side of my face along the vagus nerve. In the last two months, I have had near-fainting episodes, preceded by two to three hours of palpitations. My cardiologist said these near-fainting episodes are referred to as vaso-vagal syncope (named after the vagus nerve). Do you think the shingles and the near-fainting are related or is this just a medical coincidence? Has anyone had shingles or near-fainting happen in close proximity?

While I was standing there, I was hit by an episode of which I had never had happen to me before. As I stood there, I became extremely dizzy, started to black out, became very weak and had a very strong feeling of nausea. I had to lie down or I felt like I would pass out or vomit. As I lied on the couch, I went into a cold sweat and started to tremble for about 10 min. After that, it all passed and I felt fine except the shakes lasted for another 20 min and then tapered. Ever since then, I would have these attacks about once or twice a year. I found out last year that my mother had a few of these attacks in her lifetime and actually passed out because she could not lie down quick enough. She went to emergency room and had numerous tests done (this was about 30 years ago). They could not find anything wrong with her! I have recently asked a doc about this problem right after my last attack but he did n't have an answer. I can not pinpoint what triggers these attacks. They happen at diff times in day, during diff daily activities and standing or sitting. Does anyone know what I am dealing with or have the same attacks?######Hey I think that I can help you out. I experience the same thing. I had to go through numerous tests for years. Then when I had a really bad episode I was rushed to the emergency room. It was then that I found out that I have been having epsileptic seizures. This is what it sounds like is happening with you. I recommend that you talk to your doctor about this possibility. I also think that you should have your blood sugar level checked. Seizures can be triggered by numerous things like temperature change, extreme heat or cold, stress, and low blood sugar. I was told to carry a few pieces of candy on me and if possible to have a glass of orange juice before these episodes occur-at the first sign of any dizziness I experience. I also would recommend that when you feel these episodes coming on before the blackout stage that you immediately sit down and if at all possible lie down. This is because you should protect yourself from hitting your head which can cause more serious medical problems. Please keep in mind that I am not a doctor and only a doctor can know for sure. Well I hope that I have been of some help to you and I wish you well.######Well guys, I went to a diff doctor yesterday. He told me that it was vaso vagal syncope and that it is pretty much untreatable. Said that I would just have to learn to live with it. I did some research on it and alot of people have this disorder. I found a forum on it and seems that it is a very common thing. I guess I am lucky because most people with this disorder do pass out during an attack as I am able to catch it before I do and lie down. It is a disorder of the heart of some kind. Here is what I found... Vasovagal syncope is not a serious or life threatening condition, but in effect an abnormal reflex. This results in a drop in blood pressure leading to decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in dizziness or fainting. The mechanism of vasovagal syncope is the subject of a great deal of research. It may best be described as the following: â$ cents when we sit or stand, blood settles in the legs and abdomen â$ cents as a result, less blood returns to the heart â$ cents the blood vessels leaving the heart have detectors in them called baroreceptors that detect a decrease in blood pressure â$ cents the baroreceptors send a message to the brain, which in turn sends a signal to the heart to increase the heart rate, and tighten up the blood vessels â$ cents this process occurs constantly in all of us as we adapt to changes in posture â$ cents in vasovagal syncope, an abnormal reflex occurs that results in withdrawal of the message that speeds up the heart and tightens up the vessels, often because of an overshoot in the reflex that compensates for the fall in blood pressure â$ cents the resultant decrease in blood flow to the brain will result in dizziness or lightheadedness if mild, and progress to fainting or loss of consciousness if more severe â$ cents there are several variants of vasovagal syncope that can trigger the same reflex, including situations such as the sight of blood, injury, blood testing (needles), going to the washroom and several others that are quite uncommon. What are the symptoms? The symptoms in vasovagal syncope are slightly different for each person, but often include many of the following characteristics: â$ cents most episodes occur while standing, occasionally sitting and almost never lying down â$ cents patients often describe feeling very warm and sweaty before blacking out â$ cents nausea and rarely vomiting can precede episodes â$ cents observers often describe the patients as pale (â$ white as a sheetâ$) â$ cents patients are usually unresponsive (â$ outâ$) for less than a minute â$ cents patients may have some twitching while unresponsive, but seldom shake violently, bite their tongue or lose control of bowel and bladder function. The latter are more suggestive of a primary seizure. â$ cents after regaining consciousness, patients are usually immediately aware of their surroundings, who and where they are â$ cents after an episode, patients often feel somewhat dizzy and report feeling tired for as much as 24 hours â$ cents patients that learn to recognize the warning signs can avert losing consciousness by sitting or lying down promptly..######-General Forum Topics###-General Q and A

A week ago I was taken to the ER due to the mass amount of blood I was having in my bowel movements, as well as the extreme stomach pain and cramping. They took a CT of my abdomon and it showed my 3/4 of my colon was inflamed, and they leaned towards the cause being ulcerative colitis. They immediatley put me on steroids and admitted me to the hospital. 3 days later, once the inflammation was down, they performed a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Upon this procedure they found a small imflamed portion of my colon, and after the biopsy results, concluded it was neither ulcerative colitis or chrons. Has anyone gone through this before? Could the steroids have masked my problem before the doctor was able to diagnose? Any suggestions or comments are appreciated. :)######No the steroids just got down the inflammation in order to have a colonoscopy. You do n't want them poking around while its upset to start.

If you can take mesalamine, that would be a good start. Pentasa is a med that releases at the start of the ileum, and does go through the colon as well. Do you see your GI at regular intervals?

Since you do have a chronic bowel disease, you do need to get in with a specialist asap. The medication I suggested will also help with maintenance. I suggest you consider these first for long-term.

I 've been a member since May '06 and I have n't visited in awhile. In that time, I ca n't seem to find the old threads I had posted on before. Anyway, I was diagnosed with Crohn's (finally) this past November. My doctors started me with Bentyl for the cramping and Budesonide to treat the Crohn's. After 2 months, that has n't helped. So, as of yesterday, I was switched to Pentasa. Has anyone had any success for treating Crohn's? If so, with what medications? I 'm still having a difficult time adjusting to living with Crohn's and any/all advice, suggestions, etc would be helpful. OR, if there are any other Crohn's threads, I 'd appreciate a link! Thanks- Sherri######I am suffering from Crohn's just like you. And I am fearful of my lifestyle in the future. I had an abscess that formed in August, and my colorectal surgeon drained it and put seton tubes in it. After that was finished, the healing process was very, VERY slow, due to the Crohn's. My gastroenterologist prescribed Entocort first, which is a mild drug used to treat the disease, but for months of taking it, it has had little to no effect on me. The infection is still there, and they are going to use a last resort treatment called remicade. My infusion is scheduled for tomorrow. Apparently it 's a gastroenterologist's final solution before doing more surgery. So, if you see your doctor, hopefully he has talked to you about the possibility of drugs such as entocort, prendizone, and Remicade to treat your Crohn's disease. Each one being successively more potent.######Hi there, Thanks for posting. I actually started out on Budesonide, which is Endocort. (Endocort is the generic version). I was on Budesonide for 2 months without any changes at all. They just switched me to Pentasa (along with Bentyl for cramping) but I 'm having such a difficult time. The Pentasa is making me EXTREMELY nauseous. I 'm hoping that I get used to it and that will end. Good luck to you!######Hey guys !! Yay, more Crohn's people !! Not that I 'm happy we are all suffering, but it is good to know there are a few of us out there. I have been on pentasa for about three months now and it is only now starting to work for me.

No, just a colonoscopy w/biopsy What is the antibiotic the doctor put you on? Pentasa, 250mg, two pills, three x's a day.######Hi, No antibiotic. I have ulcerative colitis and it 's limited to the rectum/sigmoid. The med you are on is a 5ASA med, not an antibiotic. it 's a topical antiinflammatory which dissolves in the lower part of the small intestine and the upper part of the large bowel. I 'm also on 5ASA meds called Asacol (oral 6 per day) and Salofalk (rectal retention enema). Look up Pentasa and 5ASA but separately. It 'll give you information you need. No, I have n't had a small bowel series since Ulcerative colitis is n't in the small bowel. You may have Crohn's, but the med you are on will definitely help with the inflammation. Yes, I have a gastroenterologist and would only want to be treated by one. I 'm impressed yours did n't put you on prednisone or steroid.

I am now 23. Every flare up I 've had, I 've had obvious symptoms (fever, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, etc). Lately though, I 've been constipated like no other. I can go a week/ week and a half without going unless i take something. My tummy is swollen and painful, and I 've notice some dark/muscousy blood, but not a ton. What the heck is going on with me? Has anyone had a flare up without having diarrhea? I 'm having a routine colonoscopy in a couple weeks. Constipation seems to be the exact opposite of Ulcerative Colitis and I ca n't find much information from the internet. HELP me!######yes me! ive never had diarrhea. i was dxd last year in summer. i think it means that the inflammation is in the lower end. ie rectum anus. the stool is already formed by the time it reaches there so it would be solid. also if there inflammation higher up it would mess with the formation iykwim and cause diarrhea. the constipation and blood is for the same reason. inflammation in the lower end. it means your colon is healed so its a positive, proctitis is harder to shift though. can be very stubborn. go easy on the laxitives and concentrate on some fiber and plenty of water..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

I saw a GREAT GI specialist yesterday who also believes I could have Crohn's (I did n't suggest this to him), and he wants to do a colonoscopy. However, I found out later that the colonoscopy charge at the facility will be nearly$ 900- that does n't include the doctor's fee, the anethesiologist, or biopsy fee if necessary. My question is this: is there a benefit to having a diagnosis of crohn's vs not? A little background: my flare-ups are mild- I have mild to moderate lower right abdominal pain (the worst pain is actually in my back in the same location). I have constipation rather than D, but when I was younger would have short flare-ups of D that would wake me at night. I have n't lost weight, but my appetite is much less with the most recent pain. I 'm not keen on going on long-term medications if I can avoid it, especially with mild symptoms. Any advice would be greatly appreciated- I 've got this colonoscopy scheduled for Monday !!######It only makes sense to have a scope if it 's suspected you have CD and to be on meds if you need to. Crohn's can affect the entire wall of the digestive tract (wherever its location). Sometimes strictures can happen from continued inflammation. I know it costs to have it done, but you should make sure. One possibility is that your small intestine may have an area, and you may need another scope for that. The doc might be able to get into the last part of the ileum to see if there 's suggestion of inflammation. Let us know how it goes. q.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Gallbladder, liver, or Crohns?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis######I posted this already in the Gallbladder section, but I think it is equally or more suited here with those who have Crohn's disease and might be able to help. Hi. I 'm 24 years old and I 've been experiencing chronic abdominal pain in the upper right area of my abdomen, underneath my ribs for 3 months now. The pain is constant, and is accompanied with a lot of gurgling and a pressure that feels like there is a balloon inside. I have n't noticed any relation to anything I eat, it is pretty much constant, and I rarely have diarrhea. I have had almost every test done with inconclusive results, so I 'm looking for any suggestions here. My HIDA scan reported an ejection fraction of only 14%, but I have had two gastroenterologists tell me that my symptoms do not mimic common gallbladder issues and they do not believe it is the source of my pain. CT scans and ultrasounds have not shown any gallbladder stones or noticeable inflammation. The other tests that came back abnormal are a high bilirubin level in the blood (3.0 in the last test), a borderline low Vitamin B12 level, and a positive indicator on an IGG test. I have had an EGD, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy all of which did not find anything. With all of this, my gastroenterologist has diagnosed with me Crohn's disease and put me on Prednisone and Asecol HD medications. She admitted that Crohn's disease can sometimes be hard to diagnose and she ca n't confirm that is actually what is wrong with me. Is there enough evidence to be treated for Crohn's disease? Can it still be a gallbladder problem even though my symptoms are n't the same as the general gallbladder symptoms? What does a bilirubin level of 3.0 mean? Can my high blood pressure medicine, Bystolic, be related to any of this? My biliribuin was 0.9 in 2009 before starting BP medicine. Should I be doing more or just take the prednisone for the next 8 weeks? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated since I have had a few doctors testing me for months without anything conclusive.######I would get a second opinion before I started taking steroids and Asacol. It could be crohn's but with nothing showing on any of the test that is a reach in my mind. It would be like telling someone with a pulled muscle they have crohn's and starting tratment- she has the same amount of proof... Get a second opinion first, and ask your primary about the side effects of your pills. Also I assume that you have had your blood tested in the last three years while on the meds, ask your doctor to look at your levels over that time- see if they went up....######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

I have chronic nausea, stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, excessive burping, I get full after a few bites, 30 lb weight loss, blood and mucus in stool, and fatigue. My body temp is often 1-2 degrees lower than 98.6, I have traveled all around the world b/c I am in the military, the doctors say I have pernicious anemia (low B-12). I also have been having irregluar menstrual periods for the past year with severe cramps, vomiting, and heavy bleeding. The doctor gave me a colonscopy and EGD which came back normal except for mild gastritis and a small amount of diverticula. I had a CAT scan which showed inflammation in my intestines. The doctor is speculating, but thinks I have Crohn's disease. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am currently taking Phenergan to help with my severe nausea. It helps sometimes, but is n't strong enough most of the time. Thank you for taking the time to read this.######It does sound like Crohn's, though that would (probably) have shown up in the colonoscopy- ulceration in the bowels as well as inflammation, but I 'm not sure enough of Crohn's to say that for definite. That 's just my experience of it. Your symptoms sound like what I had before it was diagnosed and treated. Crohn's \* can \* (but not necessarily in every case) affect the entire digestive process from the mouth to the rear end, I think in the form of ulceration. I think the ulceration causes the inflammation, though that 's just my logic on it. My colonoscopy showed long streaks of ulcers thoughout my large bowel, a couple of them were in a bit of a bad state, but most of them looked like an normal ulcer you get in your mouth. It 's not like they 're hard to miss with a camera and a light. A barium scan can identify whether there is inflammation in the small bowel, but you should be able to work that out yourself- when you eat a proper meal, do you get pains shortly into it, need to stop for a while, then in (for example) 5 minutes you 're able to start eating again (and not feeling full)? I do feel a tad sorry for you, as in going through a colonoscopy and then still no diagnosis, that really sucks. You might have to go through it again. You might also want to seek out a second opinion. I did and that 's when things started getting sorted out (though the first opinion did n't go as far as a colonoscopy). I 'm no expert, I 'm not saying what you 've got is Crohn's- the problem is the \* o \* utward symptoms are the same as for a number of other problems. I 've done a small write-up of my experiences with Crohn's, which may be of use to you: (url) http://www.legolas.com/mikes/27-03-03.html[/url]######I have also been going through alot to find out if my problems are Crohn's related. I will be having a colonoscopy soon but am very nervous about that procedure for a number of reasons (one of which is that I just do n't think I 'm ready to accept a possible diagnosis like Crohn's Disease.) I 've researched Crohn's, and your symptoms do n't really sound Crohn's related to me, but they easily could be, since they match so many digestive disorders/autoimmune disease. I have a disease called Celiac Disease, and I have had many of the symptoms you named. I felt full very fast, had some nausea, and lost almost 25 Lbs. I also had watery diahrea and many other NON-gastro related symptoms. You sound as if Celiac is what you may have... usually it is genetic but in my case, no one else in my entire family has it, so it does n't HAVE to be genetic. You can get tested by requesting the blood work which is specific for this, and then maybe a biopsy to see if your small intestine has been damaged. This will reveal whether it is Celiac. In the meantime, know you 're not alone. I 've been depressed and worried ever since my dr. told me he thinks I may have Crohn's in addition to Celiac, which means 2 autoimmune intestinal diseases instead of one, and that is very daunting to say the least. Good luck with whatever test you decide to undergo next.######How old are you? My lover has Crohn's and says it would n't necesarily show up in a colonoscopy, and early stages of the disease usually show up in your early twenties. He also says that if these are new symptoms, like within the first year, that it is hard to diagnose. You should go see a gastroentronologist (sp?) .######I 'm 30, and I 've been sick for about 18 months now. It began with vertigo, dizziness, and then difficulty walking and balance problems. Finally, I began having diahrea which was severe and exhausting, and lost a lot of weight very suddenly regardless of how well I ate. That 's when I was tested for Celiac Disease, and had a biopsy which showed severe damage to the small intestine. I also was inflammed all the way from the top of my throat to the colon. However, the colon itself has never been looked at, which is why my GI doc suggested the colonoscopy. I did have some symptoms that were gastro-related as far back as my early 20s, but really the worst of this began when I was 28. I still have n't had the courage to schedule the colonoscopy, I 'm hoping it 's not as bad I think it might be, though. I 'm wondering also if inflammation of my esophagus and stomach are symptoms of Crohn's, and how the doctors can distinguish what is just inflammation due to gastritis, and what is Crohn's related inflammation? I wonder what exactly they see that specifically makes it Crohn's? Also I 'm curious how much of a role genetics play, because no one else in my family has Crohn's, but I know already that my intestines are in bad shape and am wondering if Crohn's can do that kind of damage, or if it is in fact Celiac Disease as my doctor has suggested..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Thanks.######My daughter has colitis and is AB + Jen######There is no specific blood-type common with CD or UC. q######I believe Quincy is correct. So let's look at this problem in a different way: Each blood type is susceptable but may be adversely affected by different foods. Let's say someone starts out in life with a genetic susceptibility for colitis, crohn's or IBS. One person's inflammation may be triggered by wheat while another person may be triggered by some other food or combination of foods. We wo n't know for sure unless we can get a lot of people- on this board- who are willing to try eating the recommended foods for their blood type. They would have to follow all the rules for at least two weeks. What are the chances of that happening?######I just started looking into his theories of blood type and what you should and should not eat. I also have symptoms of IBS. I have switched to eating a lot of rice and I feel better and my almost chronic diarrhea has stopped. Can you tell me which of the books on the blood type diet are the best and most informative? They been out for quite a while so there are lots of them. But when I googled the lists of foods, I noticed that the foods listed for AB + blood (my daughter inherited it from me) are the ones I have naturally gone to as they make me feel the best. Thanks......... Jenny######The first book I read, about four years ago, was from the library and I do n't remember the title.

It 's Crohn's Colitis. It means Crohn's disease in the colon. (not Crohn's/ Colitis which would mean both or either) I 'm concerned with one statement you said. . ``I believe that he can overcome this problem ''. It 's not a problem. It 's a disease he will have for the rest of his life. The disease attacks the entire wall of the intestine, from the inside to the outside. ALL of it. It can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus. It can be in one place as well as another. Surgery will not cure the disease. A person who has Crohn's will also have other physical manifestations. It can affect the eyes, joints, muscles, liver, kidneys. A person with Crohn's disease can have severe intestinal blockages where emergency surgery is necessary. The possibility that your friend may have to have his colon removed is a distinct possibility. Crohn's disease can cause abscesses and then eventually fistulas. Those are basically tunnels from organ to organ. So, imagine a disease that just burrows holes in the body. Medications for a person with Crohn's disease can also have serious side effects. Some cause allergic reactions. Some medications may work, others may not. It takes many years for a person with Crohn's disease to get to know the reality of it-- a hell disease, and I truly feel for him. So, it 's not a problem. Overcoming it is n't a priority in one's life as is learning to accept and live WITH it. And, that can take a while. OK, soapbox put away. You 're a wonderful friend who has extended your heart to someone who has something potentially debilitating. If you want to know what to do, educate yourself about Crohn's disease. Your friend may misunderstand your intent on being there for him. Sometimes, it 's just difficult to have friends, because dealing with oneself takes up a lot of time-- and it 's just easier at times to not have to explain what 's wrong. There are many fears, there is much pain, and talking about bowel movements, pain, gas, diarrhea, constipation... is n't something that everyone wants to hear. Some people CA N't talk about their disease. He may not be able to relay his feelings about the whole thing, or he just does n't care to talk about it and it 's not important to him. Bathrooms are almost always on the mind of one with CD. He will possibly be fussy with foods-- not eating many. Your friend will have to find the balance. That means to have friends who understand, friends who just listen, friends who can just be normal... etc.. Words of encouragement can definitely be taken the wrong way. Ask how he 's doing, ask what meds the docs have him on, ask him how he 's feeling... etc.. You could also openly ask him what he would like from you as a friend. Just be you, and be understanding, and know that if he says he 's not feeling well, he probably is n't. If you are true in your intent, it will work as any relationship. It grows, has ups and downs, continues or does n't. Try not to have too many expectations. Your friend will be going through tough times, and you as his friend sometimes takes the brunt of emotional relief. You are a person with feelings as well. Just because dealing with chronic disease is difficult, it does n't allow one to be rude or disrespectful. But, there will definitely be moments. It 's tough having a relationship with no health problems involved. It 's tougher when that can sometimes when health is a primary focus. I wish you both the best, and that your friend is able to get his CD stablised and out of the hospital soon. quincy######Yeah I know that he ca n't just get rid of it. . I was kind of meaning get over it mentally and live life like a normal 17 yr old, just with a few minor adjustments. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I 'm trying to learn as much as i can about this diease, but there is so much info to take in. I will keep researching. Hopefully I can talk with him about this and he 'll probably notice that I 'm trying my best, but at times it 's hard to comprehend EVERYTHING! (I think that my friend has a calstomy (spelling?) bag, so i do n't think that he has to worry about the bathroom as much) Thanks Quincy !! You helped me a bunch !!!######Hey Quincy and supermichelle! Quincy, first of all, I 'd like to say that was a wonderful post, but wow, you really made Crohn's seem horrible. Do you have a really bad case of it? I mean, it CAN be horrible, but most cases do n't have to be. Many cases of Crohn's, in fact, can be bad for a few weeks, but then go in to remission for many months to years. You are right though, many people learn to live with it and deal with the relapses. A couple of things I wanted to add (I hope you do n't mind quincy). I am not a fan of calling the disease ``Crohn's colitis '' because you get mixed up with the names. Crohn's disease along with ulcerative colitis, are two separate (and totally different) diseases which make up the entity known as inflammatory bowel disease (NOT to be confused with irritable bowel syndrome). Crohn's as quincy said can involve any part of the GI tract from the gum to the bum. Though most cases involve the small bowel in some way (usually the terminal ileum). Crohn's has a patchy look to it when you look at it through a colonoscope, and it involves inflammation through the entire thickness of the bowel wall (again, like quincy said). Ulcerative colitis is a little bit different. It usually ONLY involves the large bowel. It always involves the rectum and in different patients, continues upstream to various degrees. Ulcerative colitis only involves the most superficial layers of the bowel wall.######Hi butterflytrans, No, I have ulcerative colitis... limited to the distal part (rectum/sigmoid). A mild case controlled by 5ASA meds. I have a great doctor and have had it for almost 18 years, but diagnosed 15 + years ago. Now, why would I mind clarification... you 're an equal member of this board and I certainly do n't know everything ;--RRB- Clarify away. Crohn's in the colon IS called Crohn's colitis. I understand that term clearly, but many people think it can be Crohn's with ulcerative colitis. But, I do understand why you 'd be averse to the term. One can not have both at the same time (as clarified and confirmed by my doctor)... contrary to what people may believe. The term colitis is loose... but Crohn's colitis is definitely in the bowel. Not all the bowel, but in the bowel. One can also have Ileitis, and Crohn's colitis at the same time... etc.. With ulcerative colitis, one can have backwash ileitis... that 's where it 's just into the ileum from the ``backwash '' from cecum involvement at the opening of the appendix. One with ulcerative colitis can also have severe rectal involvement as well as cecum involvement with all the rest of the colon clear. But, it ALWAYS starts at the anus and is n't patchy throughout the colon as you stated. Crohn's can also have severe anal/rectal involvement and is much times confused with ulcerative colitis. When the fistulas start showing up... it 's definitely crohn's. (I have a friend with this and it 's hell for her... but she 's handling it very well-- I 'm in awe!) I never knew this until her experience. UC and CD are two different diseases for sure... but there are some that believe otherwise (small following). Methinks it 's because the beginning stages of CD in the colon looks like and acts like UC. In any event, the first prescribed meds (usually 5ASA) for both would work in treating the inflammation. Do you have UC or CD? Where is yours and what meds are you on? How are you doing at this time? Thanks for the input... any that is valid always is helpful and NECESSARY it seems. Talk soon, quincy######Please take my bluntness in stride... it 's not meant to be rude, just educational. Minor adjustments ?? I do n't think so... Learning to live with a colostomy (a bag that your stool is stored into) would be difficult especially at first. As a matter of fact it 's my biggest fear (I have UC). As well, there may be future surgeries which would be possible so that the bag is in the body instead of out of it. Both have to be emptied, cleaned meticulously so that infection does n't set in... etc.. It 's a different way of life and would definitely take more than just a minor adjustment. How do you feel when you get our period? Do you have to change pads, tampons, is n't it a pain to have to deal with that once a day? In comparison... imagine having to deal with poop, not blood on something that can just be discarded and another one attached or inserted and away you go. With the bags, they would have to be emptied many times a day. I understand they 're also noisy... something else to be a reminder and possibly something to hide. He 's not a normal 17 year old. His body is changed and functions differently now. There will be many issues that he will have to face, intimacy being one of them. But, this has happened to him when he 's young, and life goes on. You 're still on the right track tho, but find out what surgery he had to have done. Read up about colostomy (removal of the colon and replaced by an external bag), and the various Crohn's surgeries. That can open the door to discussion and questions to him... at least if he uses terminology, you 'll understand it. There are complications at times, but it 's not necessarily the norm. One has to recuperate after surgery and that does take time. Meds will still be required. You can find out about that as well. Remember, you 're not living with it... and YOU 'RE overwhelmed by the info. keep it all in perspective for you wo n't learn it all in a short period of time. It 's understandable for sure. It all takes time, just go along with the process and just deal with each day as it comes. It 's not a straight forward disease. Let your friend set the pace. Intake of info from any avenue varies with everyone. You seem like a great friend and with good friends, the ups and downs of recovery can be smoother. Maybe through this... you 'll pursue a career in the medical field ?? ;--RRB- I wish you the best, quincy######Small note... UC always involves the rectum, not the anus. Anal involvement with UC obviously exists, but as you have said earlier, that is more common with CD. Seeing patients having to deal with fistulas and fissures is quite eye-opening as you come to the realization they have to live with it every day. I 've also seen a few cases of perianal sepsis eventually leading to severe fistula formation... not fun... especially after the infection has cleared up and their fistulae are treated with the cutting setons. Again... not fun. Quincy, do you have any extraintestinal symptoms of UC? Any problems with sclerosing cholangitis?######Hi, What you say is true... but UC does start at the anus (internal). Maybe there 's inflammation there, but not active disease... (have n't done any searching about that part... but it 's stated that it starts at the anus, not at the rectum). Definitely not active disease as in CD which is external anus as well. Maybe talking about anal involvement means external ??? Interesting... maybe just perspective. But, those with a colectomy (UC only)... if the anus has n't been removed, for some there is still disease involvement and eventually an analectomy has to be done. So, it still involves the anus. Interesting you mentioned PSC... it 's been suspect because of my increased liver enzymes 7 or so years ago. That was a ride for sure. I did n't have the internet at that time, and a friend printed about a 2 inch stack of info. As I hilighted it I basically cried for 2 weeks. One piece of info helped alleviate my distress... a doctor was against the ERCP as a test tool, stating the incidence of pancreatitis and triggering PSC in people who only may have had the potential for it to happen maybe many years down the road was way too high, so it should only be done in people where other symptoms where almost positive that PSC was active. So, I nixed the ERCP and my doctors agreed. So far, my enzymes are steady at the elevated level... so unless they start to increase, it 's not a concern. The specialist said that the fact that I 'm female would be a probability that I do n't have it anyway... What are statistics anyway, I 've never been one that fits in with statistics... My sister has 3 ERCPs done for gallbladder disease and now had pancreatitis. I was n't willing to risk the probablility of getting that as well. Other manifestations are body pain, slight eye problems, some mouth cankers that come and go. Nothing severely problematic or OBVIOUS... but I 've had many little things forever... so who knows. My dad had ankylosing spondylitis. . there 's a connection for sure. I also have asthma (inherited from my mom's side of the family)... but there are many who seem to have both UC and asthma. . so who really knows. How about you? Do you have UC or CD, and what other connected manifestations to you have? How long? , what meds, etc? Thanks, quincy######Tell him to discuss intravenous Remacaid (Remacade) w/ his docs. DH had Crohn's for a couple of years, was on prednisone and some other drug, did the dietary restrictions and all, finally had a massive bleed-out and got one treatment of IV Remacaid and his Crohn's is \* GONE \*! It IS curable, no lie.######Hey quincy... I do n't have either... I just know a lot about the subject because of what I do. Skyspinner, remicaide is often a good treatment, but it does n't cure the disease. It just puts it in to remission. The tendency for bowel inflammation is still there, and if you trigger it again, it 'll come right back. Plus, remicaide is very expensive and it can have a lot of side-effects... especially allergic stuff and anaphylactic shock. Remicaide is a good solution for people who have failed other treatments, but it is by no means a panacea.######Ah, how so? You work for a GI? First hand info for sure !! I have the best one in the world ;--RRB-... I hope he never retires. Of course, that 's mighty selfish of me, is n't it... but I 've received such good treatment and his philosophy of treatment definitely suited me, and for that, I 'm grateful! I had one instance where I had to see another doc in the same clinic because my doc had an emergency. That doc told me bluntly that if I were his patient, he would have had me on prednisone immediately. I was shocked and said that I was relieved he was n't my doctor. I shudder to think how I 'd have been if that was the first line of treatment-- not so for where mine is. 5ASA rocks for sure! Your input is definitely invaluable on the boards, thanks for the input. Best to you, quincy######No... it 's a \* treatment \*.######Hi, Had to voice my opinion on Crohn's, my niece 18 years has just been told she has crohns and she needed 5 pints of blood, due to blood lose, she is on meds. now, we thought she was never going to feel better, but she has had many good days where she can function and even spend time with her friends, which she was too sick to do before. It takes time for meds. to start to help, not cure it but help people with it make it thro the day. We pray that with all the testing that they will find a cure, but in the mean time we have to support her, knowing everyday can chage how she functions, but she has bad days, but for every good day we feel blessed. She also takes alot of imodium, I dont know if it is the right thing to do, but if she feels better taking we dont say anything. Also being stressed is very bad for crohns, try to talk to your friend and express your conserns for his health, and how important it is to stick by him and try to keep his stress level as low as possible. He will be our prayers and I like you pray for a cure for crohns in our life time. best of luck Cookie######hi, im dennis i had crohns for 10 years.been to all the doctors, they tell me the same thing but nothing helps.i lose 22lbs, so sick i cant even drive a car.after i did get over it some what, i found a that colonics and enemas was the only thing that would help me.a lot of people thinks its crazy for doing colonics and enemas.i did to at frist, but i tried everything that the doctors said and it wasnt working, so why not.im gald i did, i havnt felt so good in many years.i dont know now bad hes got it, but i had it pretty bad only thing that i know that could help.######Hi Dennis, Just read your post and am wondering if you ever lost blood? My niece loses blood to the point she needs transfusions. She has been doing fairly good the last couple of weeks, but the other day she had blood again. I have read many post about crohns, and do not see anyone write about losing blood, so I am confused, do people with crohns lose blood or is it unusual for that to happen. Any reply would be welcomed. Thanks for any help Cookie######hi cookie51, yes i do lose blood, but not that bad.my blood count is mostly low when its checked.and i see blood when i go to the bathroom, but thats from my rectum because i had crohns in my rectum, and with a flare up its very bad.but it will go away in about 2 or 3 weeks.i use a anal cream to help heal me. i had crohns through out my colon from my rectum up to the middle and top of it.am sure during a flare up when i get really sick i to might bleed on up in my colon.but i havent been that sick in sometime now.the enemas and colonics they work, they did for me.only thing i can say is try it to see if it will work for her.there is a certain way my doctor told me to do the enemas.wish u the best.######Hi Denniss, My niece had alittle blood the other day now it has stopped. Also my sister has hemeriods and they too were bleeding so bad that they gave her 2 pints of blood. They gave her a cream and that seems to help, but my niece, she cant eat many things, she says it is like eating glass.She will not touch anything with mayonase in it, she gets really sick from that. She eats like a bird, so afraid of the pain, that she eats very little. I would appreciate any tips you have that I can relay to her that could help her. Hope You Have A Great Night Cookie######there is foods i cant eat, and am sure there will be foods she cant eat without getting sick.it depends on the person on what foods you can eat and can not eat.she will have to make a list of the ones that make her sick or just remmeber them, not to eat them. and what well help her, like i said before i use enemas to keep my colon clean.and it works for me, or colonics i use them to. i would try enemas first they worked good for me.am in kentucky what state are u in? hope i helped######Hi Denniss, I am from Il., and my niece is starting to realize what foods make her sick, I know rice and mayo, make her sick, she stopped eating any chinese food. We have a friend who is in his 40's and he has had crohns since he was 18, he said his flares up from time to time, but he said he never had any bleeding. That makes me scared, because my niece still has bouts where she bleeds. I know they said she has 3 feet of her bowel is effected, did they ever tell you how much colon is effected? Well I guess the best thing she can do right now is watch her diet, and stay away from foods that triger it. Thank you for your reply Hope You have a great day cookie######before i started enemas and colonics i had flare ups and my rectum would bleed all the time with a very low blood count.now that i keep my colon clean i havnt been sick at all or felt bad, i have had a couple of rectum flare ups.but the cream i use heals that. you never said anything about getting her to start with enemas.i started with 2 enemas a week, or a colonic and 1 enema a week.get her to try it, just make sure shes not doing any rectum bleeding.######Hi Denniss, I told my sister today about you and she said my niece has diarria all the time, so did you? She take imodiom all the time, if not she has to run to the bathroom all the time.I am curious if you had that problem, or was it the opposite, where you not able to go? I thank you for your input, we are just now learning about crohns, so any input is great. Thanks again cookie######hi cookie, yes i did have diarria all the time, i could even drink water and it would run through me.a lot of over the counter meds like that imodiom she wont be able to take it could cause flare ups and make her sick.thats what i was telling u about the enemas.the enemas stopped my diarria after about 2 weeks..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

After years of Prednisone in the late 80's I required surgery and opted for a restorative J-Pouch. Unfortunately, it really is not curative. Most `Pouchers' have a new form of inflammation of the Anastomosis, Rectal Cuff, and Small Bowel called Pouchitis. Pain is very similar to UC and Crohn's. Cramps, Gas, Sweating, Fever, Urge, and local bottom pain. What meds work for your pain?######I guess I will answer my own question... I 've had GI pain for 25 years. Ulcerative Colitis, Surgery, and now Crohn's. Finally, a couple of years ago I decided to do something about pain since it was driving me nuts. Since posting this I have tried OxyContin after using Norco for a couple of years. OxyContin works really well for GI distress; slows the gut, kills pain and cramps, and generally restored my function. Only problem with OxyContin was anxiety, it was high so I switched to which is a powerful Opiate that lasts a solid 8-10 hours. It is a pretty amazing medication. For Crohn's and UC sufferers, try to stay away from Short-Acting Narcotics like Vicodin, Percocet, and Norco. You will end up chasing the relief, counting pills, and becoming mental about it. Best to use a Long-Acting (LA) med, and have a supply of Short-Acting meds for (BT) breakthrough pain. This approach is a fairly standard practice in the pain management world. Bottom line: Pain meds have been a good addition to my other GI meds. Currently I 'm taking Prednsione, EntoCort, Xifaxan, Cipro, Lomotil, Hyoscyamine and Cortisone Enemas. ~######Hello... I also have UC for a year now and im only 24... My pain doctor gave me vicodin... yes it doesnt workvery well buti dont want to make myself look bad for stronger dose... can you help me what to say? for my next appointment on August 27... i always be prepared until i see doctor i become egg jello... He would ask me if i take 3 times a day... i lied to make myself lookgood... but i ran out fewweeksearlier going through withdrawing is the worse for my pain as UC patient... Please hellp and ill write it down what to say from you next time to see doctor so i dont change my mind... thank you!

About 12yrs ago had my gall bladder removed and ever since then I have suffered with daily diarrhea. I did n't work a job so basically life revolved around timing eating to when I would be home. I did finally get a colonoscopy back in 2006 and was diagnosed with UC. Weird thing though, UC starts in the rectum and works its way up, I am opposite.My transverse colon has the worst inflammation with very little towards the rectum. I started working last yr and have been very sick. I absolutely can not eat except very little in the evening because everything goes straight through me and I would not be able to work running to the bathroom. For the first time since the diarrhea started, I have lost 20lbs, become quite anemic, and pretty weak. I did have another colonoscopy last oct. which was pretty much the same as the first. I do n't get fever and chills, just ca n't handle food. I even tried just juicing and that would go straight through. Now two months ago I developed SEVERE rectal pain. I have been living in hell with pain, I have had to run out of work crying. I am having much less (almost none) frank blood than before, but dr said hemrrhoids. Well I have had hemrrhoids for yrs with no pain, this pain in only on the left and radiates through the cheek, down the leg and through the vaginal wall. When I get the sever bouts of pain it drains me down to nothing and of course I am terrified to eat because going to the bathroom (about 1/2hr later) sets it off and it lasts hours. I finally got so desperate I am on prednisone for the first time. I am going for a sigmoidoscopy in a few weeks. Has anyone else had pain like this with UC?######Hi, I have. I was diagnosed with UC in May/June2010 and with it was horrific pain. I have been hospitalized twice now for the UC and pain. It perplexes the doctors because normally UC patients do n't have this type of pain and hardly are on any narcotics. I do n't know what to tell you, but I feel for you. I completely can empathize with you on how much it can hurt. I 'm currently having a flare. Spent 2 weeks in the hospital and now 2 weeks at home and in bed. I have now been on some strong pain medication for the past month. The only thing some of my GI doctors are thinking is that there might be a secondary problem. Best of luck to you. I hope they can find something to help you and what 's wrong....######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Not taking any vitamins right now and no gastro- b/c of a lapse of insurance ending soon. Losing weight and more pain + tired. Said that next week will go to gastro... is that too long? should i be more assertive in my concern? could it be very serious or as my friend says- is just a flare up and next week is ok. Also, seems very ``out of it '' and lightheaded even. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. OPAL88######Are they bleeding? How much weight has been lost? Are they able to keep any food in. . or is there constant diarrhea? I would get some electrolytes into them ASAP... Probably very dehydrated. Flares can seem very bad, and if the blood is n't pouring out and they 're able to keep food in, I would say a week would be okay. This is not a professional opinion. The sooner the better on the Gastro, though... Even if you ca n't get to the gastro until next wee and its pretty severe, you could take them to the ER where they could get an IV w/ some nutritional supplement/meal.######Thanks for the reply. I 'll try and push some electrolytes. He 's not eating much, but as you can imagine is n't all that comfortable discussing all symptoms. The weight is pretty siginificant considering the short period of time. Thankfully yesterday he did say he got the referral !!######Opal88, Crohn's Disease is probably the worse Intestinal Disesease that you can get. It is common to have flare ups with bleeding. inflammation and nutrient dificiences-- with feeling very bad, tired and faintness caused by malabsorption !! The goal of the treatment is to Control the Inflammation, Relieve the Symptoms and Correct the nutritional deficiences-- all this helps keep the disease in remission-- so, your life is Better. As you may know there is no Cure for Crohn's and left untreated it is extremely serious and even life threatening. One thing that I think would help along with any medication is to take a probiotic supplement-- Culturelle and eat yogurt that contains many active cultures-- I use Stonyfield Farm and Cascade brands.

The CT scan seems to reveal pancreatic absesses, formed (from what I read on the net) from infected pseydocysts. The first operation was complicated with massive blood loss and a part of the infected pancreas was n't removed due to the complication. He has been on anti-biotics continually for 7 weeks now. My question: We have had a tough time throughout this whole process and I would like to know the complications that can set in from further open surgery, they might re-enter through the original cut to drain all the abscesses. If the draining operation is done and the abscesses clear, is it something that can re-occur? He lost a lot of weight and does n't need insuline or other enzyme producing medication. Is there a risk to this surgery? Is the pancreatic abscesses the ``last '' complication we can expect from the original operation? The doctor's have not been providing a lot of information...######I had the same operation on November 20 had drains put in and removed been on the anti-biotics 2 to 3 diffrent ones at a time been in out of hospital lost over 60 pounds. I do n't know if there is an end. my doctor told me there was 25% chance that i would never be rid of the pain. Yesterday feb. 22 i was told that i was in that 25%. I hope and pray for you and your husband that he wo n't fall in that 25% My next step is going to be Sloan Kettring in NYC######I developed acute pancreatitis and psuedo cysts from gaulstones and lost most of my pancreas. 1.5 years later my spleen was removed. This was several years and many operations ago. I have to take enzymes and still deal with pain management, but you can live. Your whole world has to change. You will need to support your husband and amend your life as well. Try to understand that the pain he is in will be real- even years later. The open surgery will take several months to heal and this is critical- NO LIFTING- This can cause a hernia and more operations. Absolutely NO LIFTING for about 6 months of anything over a couple of pounds. There also might be drainage and the wound might reopen a little to purge waste. This in not that abnormal. 2 of my wounds did have this happen weeks later. Low fat diets are a key to survival. Small meals also. Get all of your medical records including surgery notes- Have them reviewed by someone you know and trust in the medical feild that is not a current Dr of your husbands. This is to insure that all is on the up and up. If you live near a local Univeristy that has a good medical program, you may want to start going there. They tend to be up on new issues were most intrinched Dr's are not. Good luck######i had a slenectomy and distal pancreatectomy on the 25 august could someone tell me how long the recovery time is as i still have pain some days worse than others. many thanks s######I had my distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy on 7/30/10, and was hospitalized four more times after surgery for complications-- mostly due to fistula and abscess. My last time in I went into septic shock and they drained almost 350cc of horrible goop out of my abdomen. If you read up on these procedures, the complications occur in 60% or more of cases. So, you 're not experiencing anything out of the ordinary, but frightening nonetheless. It has been over a year and a half, and while I am much better, I still suffer from abdominal cramping, weird bowel movements and a little bit of nausea at times. I have taken replacement enzymes (Creon) in various doses, and that seems to help a little. Still, no one can tell me conclusively whether I 'll ever feel like my ``old '' self. The thing that I keep in mind is that regardless of the minor inconveniences I have to bear, I have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I am alive. Even though my type, non functioning neuroendocrine, is much rarer and follows a much more indolent course even if it does recur. I have done significant research and have found that even patients with recurring or metastatic disease can live a long time. It 's not the death sentence that adenocarcinoma tends to be. Still, there have been patients with adeno who have also lived much longer than the odds. My best advice is this: BE POSITIVE, and be your own advocate. Ask questions, do research; the internet has a wealth of information that can make you better informed. Question and or ask for clear explanations about everything. Join a group like PANCAN and Gilda's Club so that you can get all the support you can get, even beyond family members and close friends. My doctor tells me that he does n't like to talk in terms of cure, but he does n't tell me not to go out there and live. Believe me, everyday is precious and there is always someone else out there less fortunate. Good luck to all of you! Bob Fort Lauderdale, Florida######Bob, Nice to know another person that has been through the same thing. I had my operation 1/26/10. I too, had a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. My diagnosis was functioning nets... it was producing the hormone calcitonin. I had to go back into the hospital two weeks later and I had 1000... Yes 1000ccs of fluid removed... then a 400 and 600 ccs of fluid removed later. I have suffered pains eating and I still have pains. They have recently discovered another spot on or near my pancreas or surgical bed. I had an octreoscan which the spot took the uptake. My surgeon thinks it may be something else other than cancer... oncologist plans on a fine needle biopsy. I will have results hopefully by mid December. Have you or do you still have pains?

It was removed 3 weeks later but then a month after that I was re admitted with a twisted bowel due to adhesions caused by the surgery. 8 months later, I have started getting pain again after eating/drinking and worry the cancer has come back. I had my 8 month bloods and scans done and am awaiting the results next week.######Hi, im also a 28 year old female and on 10/8/12 had a distal with splenectomy, i had a 9cm tumor in the tail of my pancreas which pushed against my spleen, doctors said my spleen was almost as big as my liver.

Since then ive had little pain but my worry is after i eat i get a weird pressure where the tumor was and feels similar to when it was there, its not really painful just uncomfortable and doesnt last long.im scared to death it has come back, im scared to death im going toget cancer, its eating me up, i know it could be worse and believe me im very thankful, just scared.

More possibilities below: Idiopathic pancreatitis under age 40 Quote: Extensive or invasive evaluation is usually not recommended in those with a single episode of pancreatitis who are younger than 40 but some reports recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) even after one attack if the cause is not clear to look for pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors at or near the ampulla, microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct, and early chronic pancreatitis. Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain. My husband died of Pancreatic Cancer 15 years ago. oh, and the depression is worse, of course. Wishing you luck Ann######Hang in there!######Oh gosh, Ann, that sounds terrible. I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment. Can that happen from acute pancreatitis or only chronic?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

Spent a week in the hospital and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I was informed and told not to drink and being young and immature (24) I thought I could slip a beer or a drink in here and there which eventually led me back in the hospital for three days. Since then I stopped drinking for a while and one night at a graduation party had a few drinks which led to more drinks which led to pain but no hospital. I have now been sober since that day but I do have pain that comes here and there. When I went for a scan and bloodwork I saw my file and it said chronic pancreatitis. I am going to see a new doctor on the 21st. It seems like their is nothing much that can be done here but start eating better and NO DRINKING AT ALL. I only have my fathers insurance (which is a great insurance) until I am 26 which is 2 years from now. I really want to get the pancreas looked at to see how much damage I have done from drinking heavily since I was 19 years old. I was reading that I should maybe look into getting a contrast-enhanced pancreatic CT scan. Also what are thoughts on oxycodone and roxicet when you are diagnosed with pancreatitis? Sometimes I take these if I am in a little pain but read these might not be good for you if you have pancreatitis as well. What is the mortality rate from pancreatitis? How long do people normally live with this disease? Now that I have a little more informed I still get no definitive answers from doctors or gastros they all say the same thing which is eat healthy and do not drink. I still would like to know more. Thanks for any comments in advance. Brian######Okay I can only answer a few of your questions. I believe that pancreatitis is not cureable, it is manageable though, through diet and meds. As far as taking Oxycodone and Roxy's when your only in a little pain... thats way overdoing it. Heavy narcotics are dependance causing drugs if you take them for long periods of time. You also get used to them over time as your tolerance increases, so you have to take more and more to do the job. This is not a scenario you want to get into to control ``a little pain ''. These kinds of meds are meant for chronic conditions which cause major pain, we 're talking 8, 9, 10 on a scale of 1- 10, all day everyday. So you should really think about that. good luck, kat.######-Health Issues###-Pain Management

This was due to my alcohol use. I only drink socially but when I do I binge drink. Im not an alcoholic just a normal college kid. Im having a hard time accepting the fact that I may be able to ever drink again but is there anyway I possibly could if I closely monitor my alcohol use and drink in moderation and cut back a lot? I have been drinking mostly alcoholic energy drinks and vodka since ive been down here at school, mainly in part cuz its the most forgiving to my wallet. Ive heard alcoholic energy drinks are really bad for you and the FDA made a threat to take these off the market recently unless it was proven they were safe to drink. I was also taking nitrous oxide supplements whenever I 'd work out at the gym, so I think this could have also played a factor into this pancreatic attack. I also had a similar attack almost a year and a half ago, the pains were very similar. It was however diagnosed as gastritis so I dont know if they misdiagnosed it or not. Obviously my health is# 1 and I am planning on taking an indefinite time off of drinking until I fully recover from this. It sucks bc my friends 21st bday is in 2 weeks and me and a bunch of friends were planning on going to celebrate in vegas for spring break in 1 month I will most likely be a DD for him on his bday weekend and its going to be really hard resisting temptations to want to drink in Vegas but if I have to obstain from alcohol then thats what Ill have to do. The doctor said I recovered really fast bc I had been taking good care of my body otherwise (diet) etc.. So will there be any possible way I can come back or is alcohol a done deal in my life?######You make the choice: give up alcohol or risk the possibility of recurrent bouts of pancreatitis (and the possibility of a lifetime of suffering due to chronic pancreatitis).

In july of 2002 I started getting severe pains in my upper right stomach. These pains went on until last year off and on, when I was told I had chronic pancreatitis. I have never been a big drinker. And nothing really seems to bring it on. Has anyone heard of these to having something to do with eachother? Or anyone have similar gastric problems after the gastric by pass? I have had no other problems. Thanks######I had gastric bypass on july 30, 2002. I began with pancreatitis in sept.. Of 2003. Well, that is when it was diagnosed. I have not found anyone else who has had gastric bypass who has it! I thought I was all alone in this. Do you have a cyst on your pancrea also? Have you gotten help for your pancreatitis? I can not have the ercp done because of my gastric bypass so I may have to have the whipple procedure done to remove part of my pancreas. The docs assure me it has nothing to do with my bypass but I ca n't help but think it did! Let me know how you are, I would love to know if we have similar issues! Dixiemailman######I had gastric bypass about 3 year ago. My gallbladder was removed shortly thereafter. I 've gone symptom free for about a year and a half and suddenly find myself back in a bad situation. I have been having severe upper abdominal pain = heart palpatations and bouts of nausea, vomiting and fainting. At first they said it was vertigo- but that has n't seemed to pan out. I am tired of tests, dr visits, etc.. It seems that it is my pancreas. I ca n't help but think this is all somehow related. I see my Dr on Wed for the ``official '' diagnosis. I have days that go by and I do n't feel any pain, just discomfort. On other days- its overwhelming- I find it hard to think of little else other than stopping the pain. I have n't had a good nights sleep in weeks it seems. This is all new to me, so I hope that it is in a treatable stage. I do n't relish taking medicine again- since this was one of the main reasons I had the bypass done. I 've been without perscription meds and it has been wonderful- until now. What a trade off ????######i had a GBP in september 2006, and just in the last few months, started with the pancreatitis. never know what will set it off, tuna one day, and not the next. bread hurts... no booze... sour cream started this last one. but five guys hamburgers (ok, so half a hamburger), does n't hurt. it 's the most annoying thing in the world. mother's day sucked because i could n't eat anything. i ended up just having a grilled burger. one taste of potato salad, and i was under the table with pain. i 'm so tired, i ca n't work, i ca n't concentrate, and the fainting and other stomach issues are getting worse, vomiting and diahrrea. i could go on but i wo n't. good luck to all of you... Judy######The M & J talk show today 7/7/09 seems to say there is a connection between gastric by pass and pancreatitis something about bands and the way the used to do the procedure######I have had Gastric Bypass surgery Jan 2004 and in Dec of 2008 had an episode of acute pancreatitis. The doctors immediately blamed it on drinking too much and did n't look any further. In my own research on the topic it does appear as if I may have triggered the bout of pancreatitis with alcohol to some extent however all the information I can find indicates that a person will have been a ``heavy '' drinker (more than 10 units a day; a 750 ml bottle of 12% wine has 9 units) for as much as 10- 15 years prior to a first episode of pancreatitis. By the definitions they use, I would qualify as a heavy drinker but I have only been drinking at this level for about 2 years... I am wondering if the Gastric Bypass Surgery has in some way made me more vulnerable to pancreatitis from drinking? Obviously since December 2008 I have significantly cut back on my drinking but every time I ``slip '' up and drink even less than I used to drink before the first episode I have a flare up. I have not seen my doctor about subsequent episodes. If anyone has any information on the relationship of pancreatitis and gastric bypass surgery I would appreciate a reply.######I had my Bypass in 2004, my Gallbladder out in 2007, and I began having pancreatitis in 2008. I 've been hospitalized twice with the pain. I 've had MRI's, CAT Scans, scoped, ultrasounds (inside and out) and no cause has been found. When I start hurting it can last 5-10 minute or 1-2 hours. I just keep phenergan and lortab around for the pain. I wish I could find a treatment/cure. After an attack, it takes me 2-4 days to get over it and back to work.######I had gastric bypass surgery in 2005. Recently I was in the hospital with diverticulitus, but still did n't feel well after I got out of the hospital. After additional testing my lipase numbers are over 1000 and I have been diagnosed with pancreatitis- however the cause has yet to be determined. I am very frustrated and am tired of feeling like crap. It also bothers me that the first thing the doctors go to when everything else turns up negative is alcohol. I do drink, but not daily and not in access. I asked whether or not the gastric bypass might be a cause of the problem and was told no. Now I am starting to wonder. Has anyone's doctor ever said yes?######Lori i to just found out that i have chronic pancreatitis but it took 8 years and countless docs to tell me. Finally the University of Minnesota hospital found it. And my doc there actually said to me that him and the gastric bypass should start a clinic for women who have had gastric bypass and then get pancreatitis, he said they see it EVERY day! and that they are definetly related! I have had countless docs tell me that my ``problems '' were not related to the bypass which i knew was bs cause they started after it. good luck to you######I had my gallbladder removed in 2003 and had gastric bypass in 2004. Suddenly last Spring (March 09) I started having upper abdominal pain that I thought was due most likely to a tear after a violent vomiting episode (although I described the pain as exactly the same as when I had gallstones). I went to my bypass dr who prescribed prilosec and some liquid stuff used for ulcers. She said it should get better on its own in 4-6 weeks. It did n't. After 6 months of pain I went to a different doctor who did n't really have a clue what to think. They did a ct scan and said they saw a clump of what they figured was undigested fiber in my stomach and scheduled surgery immediately Oct 2009. After the surgery the dr said he did n't find anything at all. (yeah that was fun.) Even though he did n't find anything the pain disapppeared for 5 glorious pain free months. Last weekend it came back with a vengence. I have n't gotten more than 1 hour of sleep at a time this whole week because the pain wakes me over and over. I 'm exhausted. Today I got a surprise, light colored yellow/gray stools and I 'm sure it 's nothing I ate that made it that way and I 've been getting dumping syndrome (dizziness, sweating, shaking, confusion, light headedness, nausea, diarrhea and chills) even after eating protein which usually us what I eat to feel make that feeling go away. I really do n't want to go back to any of the doctors I 've seen. It 's clear to me they do n't know whats going on and their meds are n't helping. They keep telling me to take them before I get the pain but unfortunately I ca n't really plan for that outside of bedtime because thats the only time it consistantly happens... which by the way the meds give me at the most (and I 'm being generous here) 3-5 minutes relief before the pain is back full force. I 'm not like others I 've read about. I do n't notice anything specific I eat causing the pain, it 's so random it drives be crazy. It 's dibilitating. I ca n't sit still when it hurts and I ca n't think of anything else but the pain when it 's hurting. I live in Minneapolis and would like to know the name of the doctor dshiffer1974 posted about at UofM hospital. Please, if anyone has the name of a doctor who can help in the twin cities area I would really appreciate it !!######mystc77 i see dr freeman and dr leslie at the u of m dr leslie is a gastric bypass doc and freeman is pancreas doc. Light colored oily stool is a sure sign of pancreatitis, let me know if you have any other questions i dont want anyone to suffer like i have######Thank you for your quick response. This has been going on so long and I frustrated at the fact that I 've told the drs that I 've had my gallbladder removed and the pain I feel is the same as when I had gallstones and they did n't even consider a pancreas issue. I did n't either but then I 'm not a doctor. Last time I searched this stuff I did n't find anything about pancreatitis but I 've done more than enough reading tonight to know this has to be whats going on. Are you familiar with Dr. Sibley? She 's also with UofM. After looking at the Endocrinologists there she 's the one I 'm most interested in seeing (she specializes in Thyroid disfunction which I also have). A one stop shop for me! No matter what I 'm going to walk in at Fairview Hospital in Maple Grove tomorrow if tonight is like every other night this week... which I have no doubt it will be... it 's already started. Dr. Sibley sees patients there so I 'm hoping to get a referral to her when I 'm there. I honestly do think there should be a clinic for post GBP patients for this after seeing how many people have had this same problem. If not a clinic, there should at least be a risk listed to pre-op patients so they know what to look for and where to go for help if it happens. I would have appreciated it. Even in hindsight had I known this was a possibility I would still have had my GBP surgery. I still think it was the best thing I could have ever done for myself.######Debra R I had my gall bladder removed because of many acute pancreatitus attacks. Then Dr. Berry Sanchez in Burlingame CA removed my stones in a difficult surgery because I also had a gastic bypass surgery in 2004. The acute pancreatitis is gone but I still have a burning feeling in the left side of my back and in the middle of my stomach at times. The pain is not too bad compared to the acute pancreatitus. I started juicing and I have given up all meats period! I only eat fresh fruits and veggies and tuna. I am losing a lot of weight but I wish this burning feeling goes away. Acute Pancreatitus can turn into chronic pancreatitus if one of your attacks damages or scars your pancreas. I need more than two hands to count how many attacks I had before the stones were removed and my last one was really bad. I know doctors are not perfect and there are so many things being discovered, and for that reason alone is why I am not considering sueing the Dr. the lied when he documented that there were no stones left in me when he removed my gall bladder. He told me himself that he thought he left stones. Nevertheless, I know he was not able to remove them so no hard feelings.######First, I must say thank you to all for being willing to share your experiences here. I had GBP (Roux-en-Y) in June of 2004, lost 100 lbs., and had good health for over 5 years. I was feeling really good, exercising, eating healthy and, of course, increased self esteem. At the time of my surgery, I do n't know if I was informed that all I am experiencing now was a risk, and I chose to ignore that, or that I was never informed. In retrospect, given all that I am experiencing now, I do n't believe I would have had the surgery. Over the last 1-1/2 years, I had put regained 17 lbs. In January of this year, I joined Weight Watchers, and lost 11 lbs. Feeling good about that too. In April of this year, I woke up to excruciating abdominal pain that radiated to my back. I immediately went to the emergency room. It was worse than labor pains, in my experience. Blood work showed acute pancreatitis, as my pancreatic (amylase) and liver (lipase) levels were extremely high. I was admitted to hospital, on IV, for several days. I do n't know what caused it. I am not a drinker, although I did have 2 glasses of red wine & coffee with Bailey's Irish Cream the weekend prior to pancreatitis attack. At this time, my diagnosis was not attributed to GBP, while I had my doubts, given that 95% of the time, I eat healthy choices, and rarely drink alcohol. Then, on May 5th, I woke up to abdominal pain that also radiated to my back. Went to the Emergency Room. Was n't pancreatitis this time; was intussusception of my intestines, plus something else involving the abdomen, (it 's all on my CT scan report in medical jargon). Basically, my abdomen, where the suture site was from GBP was grossly enlarged, and my intestines where twisted and then ``telescoped '' into each other (that 's the intussusception part). I was admitted to hospital & had emergency surgery that same afternoon. I was grateful that the Chief of Bariatric Surgery (Dr.Borao) was at the hospital when the ER surgical resident told me I needed immediate surgery. If anyone was going to operate on me, I wanted someone that knew the anatomy of a GBP patient. Dr. Borao came to see me in the ER & told me that if I did n't have the surgery, it would rupture and within 24-48 hours I could die. Of course, I had no opposition to the surgery, and Dr. Borao saved my life. Was in intensive care for several days, and after a week came home with gastric tube that has is now removed. After coming home I thought my discomfort was related to healing, but after new bloodwork and CT scan of pelvis & abdomen, there are additional challenges. Bloodwork indicates my amylase & lipase levels are elevated, and I now have what appears to be colitis, as per CT report: ``wall thickening involving ascending colon. Inflammatory chgs of fat are seen surrounding the ascending colon & proximal transverse colon. This is suggestive of a long segment of colitis, suspicious for long segmentof colitis. '' I have read on the web that those with pancreatitis are higher risk for pancreatic cancer. My greatest fear is pancreatic cancer and colostomy. I 'm usually a very upbeat, positive person, but this persistent discomfort, bouts of pain, tests, uncertainty and insomnia have so diminished the quality of my life. I find myself regretting having the GBP at all. This is so not worth all that I 'm going through. Sorry for being so lengthy in my post. I 'm stressed over it, and need to focus on my healing and not my fear. Duke University Hospital was recommended for all gastro treatment as that is their specialty. I noted comments about U of Minnesota. Feedback would be appreciated and, yes, having a facility for post-gastric by pass patients would be phenomenal. Penina11######I must tell you that jucing has helped me a lot. I stopped eating meat and I only eat fish, low to no fat foods, and eat six really small meals a day. My body can no longer handle the big meals. I did a lot of praying and I know that this is now my lifestyle. Juicing spinach, beets, and blueberries repairs your insides. I also drink lots of water per day because Chronic Pancreatitis will allow you to get dehydrated quick. I have gone down two pant size and I am going down another. All of my clothes are too big for me (praise God for that) and I feel really good. I only have mild pain when I am hiking or doing major exercise and the pain is really mild. I stay away from foods that are harmful to me and you find out good diets for those who suffer with chronic pancreatitis all over the web. Just type in Chronic pancreatitis diets. They will pretty much tell you to juice and stay away from high fat foods. I hate that I had to give up coffee but I boldly drink about half a cut once a week. I dont get sick with that amount.######I had my Gastric Bypass in 2006, I have now been diagnosed with Chronic Pancreatitis. I was fortunate that the Doctors Discovered it early, and they did attribute it to my bypass surgery right from the start. But I still have extreme pain sometimes and have Found Gabapentin to work wonders !!! A great pain killer that leaves me with no side effects. Diet is a big part to pain control though. I have recently started taking enzymes to help with digestion so I will see how that goes. I feel for anyone who has to go through this. The one interesting thing that took them along time to figure out was through a MRI they found a fluid filled sack between my pancreas and my stomach (not attached) and if it was big enough they would have drained it, but it wasnt. They are hoping that it will go down on its own and I will be having another MRI in 4 months to check the progress. So if you are still having bouts of pain maybe ask your doctor about this. It can only be seen through an MRI. Good luck to all and here it to our health######WOW !!! Very enlightening posts !!! Thank you everyone... sooo...... I had GBP April 2009. Was fine until 4 days ago, when I had mild pain all day, right in the center of my stomach. Went to my PCP and he did bloodwork. Next day they told me the bloodwork was fine, but my pancreas was slightly irritated. (did n't contact GPB surgeon, since I went to him over Christmas for what turned out to be the flu, and he would n't even examine me !! Had his PA do an exam, because he did n't want to catch what I had !!! And said, he will only see me if I want something ``cut out '' of me !!) At any rate, I am on a bland diet through the weekend... actually, the pain went away shortly after seeing PCP... sooo... now I am sooo paranoid.... I know people with SERIOUS complications from pancreatitis, and do n't want to get any worse... I am hoping this is n't the start of horrible things to come.... . I will speak with my pcp for an update, tomorrow... I am going to speak w/him regarding the connection with GBP....######I am absolutely beside myself to hear that other people are suffering from pancreatitis- post gastric by-pass! I am a 41 year old mom of 3. In Sept/2004, I had the Rioux-En-Y Gastric done in Duluth, Minnesota (USA) I live right by Thunder Bay/Kakabeka falls, Ontario Canada. (3 hrs away from Duluth) I weighed 278 lbs! I had severe bleeding complications immediately following the surgery. Following months of recovery, I returned to my job as a By-Law Enforcement Officer with Thunder Bay Animal Services. I started suffering from severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, thinning hair, brittle nails and horrible, smelling diarrhea/watery/grey colored stools. FINALLY, 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Acute Pancreatitis. I nearly lost my life from the complications, have had numerous, numerous tests, blood transfusions and seizures. I have been in hospital more than I have been at home. My arms are so scarred from the picc lines and IV sites and now I have developed horrible, puss/fluid filled lesions on my lower legs and forearms. I have severe pain during the height of these attacks that lasts for weeks, but my amalyase and lipase levels are not even spiking anymore. All of the doctors are telling me there is nothing more that they can do. They have tried to perform 2 ERCP's but can not get into the area they need to because my anatomy is changed due to the gastric by pass. I have been in intensive care and our parish priest read me my last rites just last July. By the grace of God, I pulled through and here I am today, scared as hell and trying to live a life! I had a TRANSDUODENAL SPINCTEROTOMY (stent) last October and did so well for 3 months! I even returned to work, but only lasted 2 weeks before ending up in hospital again! Since February of this year, I have had 8 hospital admissions, lasting weeks at a time. My children have had to help carry me to the bathroom, watch in horror as I have had convulsive seizures. . I can not leave my home because I MUST stay close to the bathroom at all times! I have severe diarrhea, horrible smelling gas and spontaneous vomiting. I have lost ridiculous amounts of weight (dropped down to 121 lbs) I have NEVER weighed that in my life !! and had lost most of my hair last year. What did grow back is very fine and very silver- nothing that a little color magic ca n't fix- AND I am very grateful to have some now! Nevertheless, I have tried to go back to the surgeons who performed the by-pass in Duluth, Minnesota, but they will not return my phone calls. The Toronto, Ontario surgeon, Dr. Gary May (bless his heart), tried to do the 1st ERCP, but the scope could not reach and I somehow went into septic shock and wound up in ICU for several days. I was medi-vac 'd back to the hospital in Thunder Bay. I had another attempt under general anesthetic for the ERCP, but the surgeon could not get in the area, once again- different surgeon this time. I am currently awaiting a 3rd attempt with the double balloon scope in Toronto- hopefully soon. I have been told that there is nothing more that really could be done. I did hear that the gastric by-pass could be reversed, but really. . what good would it do now as my pancreas is now severely damaged. (air pockets have been found with my last CT/MRI) The doctors just do n't know how severe it is. I am so desperate. I barely leave my bedroom anymore. I was put on OCTREOTIDE ACETATE. I do 2-1 ml injections 3 x 's a day. I still have not got a straight answer as to why I am on this! The needles get very painful and I also have to have Gravol injections, daily. I am currently on 30mg's of Dilaudid/Hydromorphone every 3-4 hours. I just wained off of the Fentanyl Patch. I was on 300 mcg's of Fentanyl and 6 mls IV Dilaudid every 3 hours, last summer. I am also on Cotazyme/Maalox/high blood pressure meds/several anti-depressants/b -12 injections/Ativan-prn/Motillium- ENOUGH, Already! I just started seeing a pain specialist, but I am told I have to learn to live with this pain. HOW ???? I can not even make an appointment for a measly hair cut because I am so unpredictably sick all of the time. . It hits with no warning anymore... and then the ambulance, once again has to cart me to the emergency room where I wait for a bed for days at a time in the hallways. I have also developed a horrible problem with seeing my face so distorted in the mirror. It scares me to go through this! I am not so much afraid of dying from this. . I am so scared of leaving my husband and children without a wife and mother. . And the PAIN !! It terrifies me !! I am begging anyone to PLEASE write me and I will send more contact information to you. I am desperate to know how many others' suffer the same hell or if there is any way we can do something about this. Please- Let 's not do this alone. Thanks for reading about my plight. - Maria Lichtenfeld, Murillo, Ontario Canada######I found these posts accidentally, as I was looking for information about Gastric bypass as a treatment for chronic pancreatitis. I have had CP for as long as I can remember. Anyway, I just wanted to post a little info here for those that are looking for information. There is/was a doc in Minnesota, Dr. Sutherland, not sure where exactly, but I do know that he and his team have worked miracles for people suffering with CP via the procedure called Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Cell Transplant. There are also excellent docs at IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN. Dr. Sherman and Lehman (the latter I have heard recently retired, but he was a big help to me when no one else was.) have done extensive studies on the pancreas and diseases that affect the pancreas. I am so sorry that you all have had to suffer the effects of chronic pancreatitis and hope that somehow, whether through your docs or others, you will find the answers you are so desperately seeking. I can also point you in the direction of a few support groups in ``Yahoo groups '', if you use the yahoo/google search and type in `yahoo groups, chronic pancreatitis ' you will see that there are a few groups there. Some are more active than others, but they all offer information and support from people who, like you are suffering with this terrible affliction. I hope that I will see you all signing up for some of these groups and that I 'll see that you are finally getting answers and feeling much better.

I took feosol for several months, and felt some better so tapered off in taking it, because of stomach upset. I recently started feeling more wiped out and went to the doctor. My hemoglobin was normal 12.5, however I had started back on my iron about a week before. Could that affect the results of the hemoglobin? Also, my ferritin levels were sent off, I have n't got the results yet. Is it possible to have normal hemoglobin and still have low ferritin? To the point of feeling totally horrible? I mean totally horrible...... Thanks######In a word YES. I suffer with low ferritin levels (whilst my hb is normally okay), but i suffer all the same symptoms with low ferritin as I did when i was IDA (hb went back to normal following a course of iron infusions- but my ferritin continues to stay low. Accordinging to my heamatologist its what is medically known as ferropenic anemia.######I am not sure that one would feel differently whether or not the ferritin is low because it is stored iron and is not utilized by the body directly for energy. But, If the hemoglobin was at normal and a dose of iron had been taken just before the blood test it might make the hemaglobin appear normal when it is not sustained normal. A CBC is just a point in time. The reason I know this is because when I became severely anemic, the doctor was taking a CBC every week and the numbers were different each time but in a range of below normal until after the Iron infusion..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

Here is my story: I am a 31 year old female who has had iron deficiency anemia since I was about 18. I have been on and off iron pills since then. Last September i was referred to a gi doctor for an endoscopy to r/o any gi source for the deficiency. The reults of the endoscopy showed possible early Celiac Disease. I was on a gluten free diet for three months. I just had my levels re-checked. My ferritin had actually dropped on the gluten free diet, as had my hemoglobin. Although i have not followed up with the gi doc, i am guessing this means that Celiac Disease is not the source of my iron problems. I am on the birth control pill and do not have heavy periods. I exercise almost daily, but do not think i exercise enough to cause low iron levels. Also, while on the Celiace diet for the past three months, i ate almost exclusively red meat (there were not many other options for me to eat !!) yet my ferritin levels went down, so it is not for a lack of iron in my diet. I do have autoimmune hypothyroid, which i have read can effect ferritin, but my TSH is well sontrolled with Synthroid. The lowest my ferritin has been is 2, the lowest my iron has been is 15, and the lowest my hemoglobin has been is 10. The iron pills seem to help, but once my levels are in the normal range and i go off of them, i quickly become deficient. My question is when should I see a hematologist about the anemia? Would a hematologist do anything different besides give me iron pills? The gi doc mentioned that if the Celiac diet didnt work, he thought I should see one. My PCP, however, has never mentioned it. I have read that the ``gold standard '' for iron anemia test is a bone marrow aspiration- has anyone needed one of these? Are there any hidden causes of iron deficient anemia that I am missing? Thanks for your help!######My Hematologist did n't do anything different because I did n't need anything. I was just IDA and absorbing slowly. He did tell me I had to have an ablation to fix the problem. He also ordered iron for me until menopause, that 's something different. They know what to look for if there are any concerns as in anemia of chronic disease and can give IV iron too. They only do the BMB if necessary. FLFLOWERGIRL.######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

All of which is corrected with iron IF this is due to a straight forward simple (IDA) iron deficiency anemia. FLFLOWERGIRL######thank you for your reply. I was wondering.######Flowergirl is right- iron will only help if you are iron deficient. It is possible to be anemia and not iron deficient- I am chronically anemic, but I was only diagnosed when I went to see the doctor because the iron tablets were upsetting my stomach. You need to check if your ferritin levels are low as well as your haemoglobin, and if they are then you will need to take iron. If it turns out you have chronic anemia, and not iron deficiency anemia, then make sure you find out what 's causing it- it is usually a symptom of another, more serious disease.######lynn82nj-- Were you first DX `ed with IDA to find out that it was not? How did they discover that it was not IDA? Curious. FLFLOWERGIRL######I 'm still a bit unsure in my case- it seem I had iron deficiency, and then at some point a few months later anemia, but unrelated? to the iron deficiency. The anemia was from a stomach inflammation from H. Pylori. What I do n't completely understand is that my ferritin plummeted from 66 to 10 in just a few weeks after the inflammation was cured- and I had to take iron tablets immediately after, although just a few weeks before there was no iron deficiency, and iron tablets had caused black stools. (!!) I do n't know if that helps your question flowergirl! I also would like to know what 10 on the ``anemia scale '' means too (I was 9 the month before)- does everyone else get dizzy after lifting groceries/problem solving/just going about their day, or wake up in the morning feeling like they 've just been exercising and ca n't get their breath? I 'm feeling worse than I was at 9 and I 'm wondering if I do n't have something else, or if I 'm just poorly adapted to the anemia? I read about a girl who was still working a customer service job at 8.5, but has anyone been able to continue with academic work on anemia? I 've had to quit my work because I was delivering such poor results. Would be great to know your experiences. .######lynn82nj-- Thanks for your post. I was curious about the type of chronic anemia that you had. I too would have chronic anemia if it were n't for my doc saying that I am married to iron supplements. Your ferritin dropped because you used up all your iron, as it was trying to keep up with the lowered Hgb levels which caused your anemia. There is an automatic mechanism that knows when to kick in whenever there is blood loss, and calls on the ferritin stores possibly depleting them depending on the demand. If I understood your story correctly. Iron and blood loss both are a cause of black stools, some irons turns stool green. That would scare me after an internal bleed taking iron and the stool becoming black. To answer your question, a 10 Hgb is borderline moderate to mild anemia and 9 is moderately anemia. I understand what you are saying about feeling worse. This happened to me when I was 8.5 in the beginning I did n't even know it and felt almost completely fine (like the girl in your story) until one day I almost blacked out once. I was working really hard physically. Then, as time went on and my blood levels were building I felt much worse. The only thing that I can think of that would cause this, is the fact that ~ for me ~ it went on for along time. My blood cells were severely small at 65 MVCV and not carrying enough oxygen needed for the heart to function properly. I had palps, tachycardia, high BP, and all sorts of fun things happen as a result. I think that because your anemia came on rather quickly that your body did n't have time to adjust, as mine went on for years probably. Your tolerance of anemia is proportional to the rate that it has developed. This is probably why your symptoms are more profound than someone with a slowly developing anemia like myself. I had to quit working, some people do. Everyone handles anemia differently; it really depends on what else your body has to deal with, as in any other underlying conditions. In a few months you will mostly likely recover from your anemia and then you will know if this is the cause of your problems. In the beginning it only took me 2 months to become non anemic. Good luck to you. Keep us posted. FLFLOWERGIRL######Thanks for your post Flowergirl- yes, I think you 've understood me correctly. That could definitely explain why I 'm feeling worse now than at any other point. What do you mean, you were non-anemic in 2 months ``in the beginning ''? How did it recurr, or why? Was it the same kind of anemia in both cases? Are you completely cured now? It sounds like your blood cells were really, really small. .######lynn82nj-- I was unable to tolerate iron and ended up with enteritis for 3 months (inflamed sm intestine and nausea), that was from taking ferris sulfate. I had to discontinue iron until healed and then resume low dose iron that was not enough and my blood dropped from 12.9 to 10.8 low with a 6 ferritin, until I had a procedure to stop blood loss. It was the same problem, instead of Iron Deficiency Anemia, it became Iron Resistant Deficiency Anemia. The anemia is resolved but I am trying to get the ferritin past 41. They say that I am having malabsorption due to long term use of PPI's for GERD. I have other symptoms probably unrelated to ferritin and anemia that came up during this period. FLFLOWERGIRL######it sounds like it must have been really frustrating- good luck and I hope that once your ferritin is ok again that that will be the end of your problems. I just got word back that my haemoglobin is now up to 11.6, just within normal range, just 4 weeks after the h. pylori being cured, and my iron and ferritin are slowly creeping up as well. so hopefully nothing more to worry about there you are right though, getting better is the hardest part- I 'm sure I was n't this weak before now! weird how the body adjusts to cope######I 'm glad that your numbers came up so quickly. Now that you are rid of the bacteria you should be fine. My mom had that happen 2 years ago with anemia and she has never had another problem with it. Best of luck to you too!

I went to my hematologist for a routine lab (I have ITP (low platelets) and other hyper-clotting blood disorders). I felt so weak- all I wanted to do was sleep. I took the trash out and was completely winded! Anyway, my red blood count is low and my hemoglobin is 8.1. I am 34 years old and female. He 's started me on folic acid supplements and 30 mg of prednisone daily (I currently take pred for my other conditions). I am freaking out because my mind is wandering about what could be causing this? They almost sent me in for a blood transfusion, but decided to try the prednisone first. Have I done something to cause this- not eating right, etc.? What is the quickest way to tackle anemia? Should I be taking iron supplements, and what is a safe amount of iron to take? Any experience or insight would be much appreciated. Thank you for reading my post.######The prednisone by itself can cause the anemia in some people. However, the usual causes in females is through menstrual cycle blood loss, recent childbirth or extended postpartum bleeding. If the problem is from lack of folic acid, then the problem will resolve after about 6 weeks with total counts improving in 4 months. Follow your doctor's advise and if you do n't trust it, then get a second opinion. Iron supplements are valuable for treating iron deficiency anemia, but may cover up a problem if there is a metabolic system problem occuring. A hematologist would have to diagnose underlying chronic conditions that are not addressed by routine diet.######Thanks for the info, Marimac!

Hemoglobin was 123. I started taking Ferrous Succinate 25 mg daily for three months, stopped it for one month to see if my body would hold the iron, and now I just got another ferritin test because I was feeling worse. Well, turns out my ferritin is now down to 10 and hemoglobin is down to 119. Could this mean the supplement was n't working, or do I have to give it more time? Thanks! \* BeautyofSpeed \*######You did n't have your ferritin built up enough to be able to stop the iron. You want to get your ferritin to at leasts 50 before you try to stop supplements. For a healthy ferritin you want to raise it even more somewhere between 70-100. Whenever there is not enough iron for use, your body pulls from the ferritin storage and uses that up. This is what happened to you. Did you ever find the reason for the low ferritin? This has to be fixed or will never be able to hold onto the iron. You can not use more iron than you are able to take in. You also might not be taking enough iron, ask your doctor about this if it is a concern. FLFLOWERGIRL######I agree with FLFLOWERGIRL. Your ferritin was low, you took a very low-dose supplement for someone with such low ferritin. So, after 3 months, it probably only went up a few points anyway. Then you stopped and your body used more iron storage up because whatever is causing this has not stopped. My opinion-- you need to figure out what is the problem (heavy bleeding), and stay on a higher dose of iron for a longer period of time. You can take your regular supplement but you probably need at least 3 of them a day.######I only took it for three months, and then stopped for a month because my naturopath wanted me to do that and see if my body would ``hold '' the iron. So, I 'm back on the supplements. I 'm not sure that 25 mg of ferrous succinate will be sufficient though. I 'm not really sure I want to take the other form of iron (gluconate and sulfate) because of the constipating/GI issues factor. I 'm hoping my naturopath will shed some light on things, because I 've pretty much given up on my doctor. The fact that my ferritin was 17 in Feb and she told me to ``add more iron to my diet '', obviously very unconcerned, has caused distrust on my part towards her (my doctor). I have been begging her, pleading with her, crying to her since 2006 now about my fatigue and inability to lose weight after eating right and exercising 4x weekly. All she tells me is-- up your exercise to 1 hour of cardio 5x weekly. But does she even consider maybe I physically am to exhausted to even do that with a ferritin of 10 ????? anyway, that 's about it...######You can take more than the one tablet of ferrous succinate. The dosage you are taking now (25 mg) is more for someone who has a healthy iron range and is just trying to maintain. You need far more to try to build your iron stores and elevate your hemoglobin. Have you determined what is causing this? The body does n't not ``hold '' iron for no reason. Your are losing blood (too much) from somewhere. If that is not corrected, then stopping iron supplements to see if it ``holds '' is kind of setting yourself up for failure. I can understand why you might be frustrated with your regular doctor but many will not treat if you are within normal values and at 17 ferritin, you are normal by medical standards. I know that, here on this list, we KNOW that 's not the whole story. But, I do think that your naturopath is also doing you a disservice by: 1) not getting to the root of the problem 2) not prescribing enough iron, and 3) thinking it is okay to stop to see if you ``hold '' the iron when the issue has not been resolved. There is never no reason to have low iron. You just do n't have that. Anemia and iron deficiency are a result of a problem.######Actually my ferritin level is 10. I have n't been able to actually speak with either my doctor or my naturopath since I found out my ferritin went down to 10. This is because I always get the lab to send me my results in the mail (that 's how I know my ferritin is 10 now). I have a doctor's appointment coming up on September 3. So yes, I agree, I have to find out what is causing the low iron in the first place. I feel the worst I have ever felt. and the more ironic thing about this is that I am finally free of antidepressants after 10 years of being on them (went off in December 2007), so I felt like I was finally getting my life/health back. I am wondering if that is part of the problem with the low iron... has anyone else ever had any correlation with iron levels and antidepressants? Thanks! \* BeautyofSpeed \*######My ferritin is 7. I still do n't know what my cause is either. I will say that I think the correlation between antidepressants and anemia is that it is pretty depressing to be anemic! I do n't think it is the pills causing anemia, but anemia causing a need for antidepressants !!

This coughing had all started when I was in Chile in January... I would cough basically 24/7 over there... The family I was staying with gave me many remedies to stop the coughing, but it did n't help. So when I got back to the U.S. I went to the doctor and she said it was acutebronchitis, gave me medicine, the whole bit... it still did n't help. I needed a new docter cause the one I had was a pediatrician. So I got an inhaler from this new doctor, used it and was fine for so many weeks almost a month or so. Then I went to the Christina Aguilera concert, screamed my head off, and brought it on. That was in April. I have been on inhalers for quite a while. I have never had asthma in my life (am 21 now). I have had lung problems due to my preamturity like bronchitis and pneumonia as a baby, but that 's basically it. The docter wants to see me in six months if I am not better. . I am better but still coughing and wheezing a lot. The last time I went she told me that my asthma is really bad and gave me a flovent inhaler and a rescue one. It is now June almost July saw her in the middle of May. Should I go back and see her or wait it out untill my inhaler is finished? I basically had asthma for like 3 months now but never knew it till I went to this new docter who is my current one. Is it normal to get ashtma later in life when you never had it before? Thanks!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Asthma

Either it 's poorly managed or I 'm just unlucky but I seem to suffer so much with it. I guess I 'm trying to work out how much problem other people have with sleep? I tend to wake up every few hours either coughing or wheezing and usually i use my inhaler and it helps and I get back to sleep but then wake up again 2 hours later with the same symptoms. I do take a preventative medication daily and throghout the day my asthma is generally okay (use my inhaler about once per day unless it 's spring, or cold weather, or I 'm exercising etc- then I need to use it 2-3 times a day). I just have most problems at night and it 's hard because it wakes my partner up and I feel bad. I 'm so sick of being sick. My cough is fairly constant but seems better during the day in terms of not accerbating my asthma too much, like it does at night. Can anyone help me work out how to sleep better and not have so much asthma during the night? It 's wearing me down.######oh no that sucks! apparently there 's a miracle drug out it 's called Montelukaot. It 's new and highly reputable.######I too suffer the same way. I am 26 and have had asthma since I was 5 yrs. Do n't remember last when I had a uninterrupted sleep of 6-7 hrs. I am completely alright in summers or when I go to any coastal places. Tried homeopathy last year and it worked quiet well but did a mistake of not taking the medicine this year before the winter arrived. Starting the course again and will keep you posted. I can completely understand how you feel but be positive######monteluko... was prescribed to me so that I would never get asthma again. I have n't started it though because my asthma got better from taking advair? I think thats what its call######I have herd a lot about advair. Is it similar to the asthalin inhaler?######idk it 's like taking flovent and ventalin but instead of taking two you just take one it works the bronch tubes and the lungs but you have to rinse after use or it causes fungal infection######I need to do something about my dust allergy because thats what triggers the asthma attack.

She says I can get in in 10 days. Hmm, I have a rescue inhaler that is almost out, can I make it last? Man I hope so, thats what I get to thinking. The doc wo n't call in a prescription without an office visit. Ok, I understand this. Well, 3 days go by and still having problems. So I call again and let them know that I NEED a new inhaler, and cant wait for another week. No help. Doc is out of the office and wo n't be back for 4 more days. Thinking all I need is an inhaler, how hard is this? I then called BOTH of my lung surgeons (yes I have had 2 lung operations) thinking maybe, just maybe someone will help... no! Furious! All I need is a new prescription and I will now have to go pay$ 100 (deductible for insurance plan) for an emergency visit to get my inhaler, and still have to go see my primary doctor next week to continue the prescription. What do I do? This is ridiculous. I can understand if Im asking for some abused street drug, but for someone who has had 2 operations and asthma for 20 years? CMON!######I wish i had an answer. I have been there and was forced to go to emergency. I hate that the medical community holds our health in their hands and play such games with us.

It started out as a cold (week one), then went to more coughing and stuff (week two), and I went to the doctor who said bronchitis. Was n't feeling much better, still had coughing and tight chest, went back to the doctor twice, and the first time they said maybe something bacterial so I got antibiotics, and the second time said oh, maybe asthma because the cough and tight chest have been going on for so long, but then said no because there was no wheezing so it must be an adenovirus (week 3). So the latest doctors visit was Monday, and I have to say, I 'm not feeling any better... Still coughing on and off (had a fit of coughing the other day that lasted 20 minutes, and that was with taking Tessalon Perles, drinking tea with honey and sitting in a steamy bathroom), chest still feels tight, and I 'm still absolutely exhausted! Could I possibly have asthma? As I said, my doctor said no because she did n't hear any wheezing, but I know that what I have are symptoms. She just said that it 's the virus clearing up and that 's what 's causing it all. Opinions?######It is possible to have asthma and not wheeze. I have what is called ``cough variant asthma. '' My primary symptom is a deep nasty cough. I do n't test positive for asthma on the tests that are supposed to tell you if you have it or not. I 'm just one of the odd ducks. I was diagnosed by the fact that the medications I take make a difference. See if you can get your doctor to give you a breathing treatment in the office. If it helps you, that would be a strong indicator that you may have asthma. Otherwise try to get some rest and see if it does n't get better on it 's own. If you get really bad go to urgent care or the ER and say you have asthma. And if your doctor does n't seem to help, look for a new one, possibly a pulmonologist or asthma/allergy doc. Take care and do n't give up until you get the help you deserve. ~ blue######That 's the thing... I 've been resting like crazy. I 've missed a lot of school, and I take naps... And you would think that after this long, I 'd be better. But I 'm not. I have a feeling I 'll be going back to the doctor as she said if I was n't better in a week to go in again.######You 're ahead of me. I waited 3 months after getting sick before I finally went to the doctor. (I forgot to mention that my asthma started from a bad cold that would not go away.) Hope you feel better soon. ~ blue######Hi, Yes definitely, here is my story. i have mentioned this a few times on the boards, my PC doctor said i didnt have asthma because I didnt have the classic sign of ``wheezing ''. For two years i had a hunch i may have it as no matter what i did i was exhaused, breathless, etc.. . but he told me no. During the year i was getting worse, nauseas, trouble breathing, chest tightness, tiredness, etc.... in May i really had trouble breathing and went to an allergy specialist for regular allergy testing and she just happened to give me the breathing test. Well she diagnosed my problem right away and i was so thankful for her. I got inhalers, etc.... Im not 100 &#37; but the meds are helping most of the time and im so relieved that i went outside of this doctor. He too thought the classic sign was ``wheezing '' which i didnt have. Even after going back to my PC and telling him what my new diagnosis was, he had the nerve to smirk and tell me ``oh those breathing tests are off sometimes ''. Thats all nice but i know my body and probably would have died if i listened to him. You definitely know when you feel like you are breathing through a straw and the horrible tiredness that follows it. Nothing and i mean nothing (even sleeping straight through the night and eating a great diet didnt do anything for me so i knew something was very wrong). Go outside of this doctor and get a 2nd opinion from someone who knows more about this.######Wow Ginger, that 's crazy! I have a feeling I 'm going to be back to the doctor's on Monday, and I 'll definitely bring it up! If she still says no, then I 'll go see someone else.######Yes definitely go outside of that doctor if you get the same answer. My doctor is old and obviously thinks everything has to have the classic signs. I have even brought up heart issues being its in my family and he told me ``oh you are only 40 years old '' you shouldnt have problems. It wasnt until my asthma diagnosis that he actually did an echocardiogram to double check things.######Heh. My doctor is definitely pretty old school.######Well, I 'm going to the doctor again tomorrow... Any advice on how to approach things?######I have cough variant asthma as well. I rarely have obvious wheezing with my asthma. I think that went years with active asthma before it was officially diagnosed. My cough was always attributed to allergies and sinus problems. Here is a list of other asthma signs outside of the obvious wheezing. I found out earlier this summer through a really observant doc that there are other symptoms that are also associated with asthma. I hope these help. cough itchy chin itchy or sore throat dark under eye circles stuffy, runny or congested nose tiredness mood change-- grouchy or extra quiet itchy, glassy or watery eyes thirst sneezing stomach ache headache fever restlessness eczema flare-up sweating heartburn change in face color- pale or flushed throat clearing restlessness heart beating faster trouble sleeping yawning######Does your doc have to give you a referral to a pulmonologist? If not, just go to one. That 's who you should be going to for asthma anyway.######The warning signs in bold are ones that I have been experiencing recently: itchy chin stuffy, runny or congested nose mood change-- grouchy or extra quiet stomach ache fever restlessness eczema flare-up sweating heartburn change in face color- pale or flushed throat clearing restlessness heart beating faster yawning So, I guess there 's a fair number of them. As to whether I can go to a pulmonologist on my own... I believe my mom's insurance allows you to make appointments freely even with specialists, but I 'm not sure... Not that my parents would take me unless the doctor said they should.

First, the diagnosis of asthma must be confirmed, and confounding or exacerbating factors like ongoing allergen presence or additional lung diseases must be evaluated and treated. There are number of conditions that can mimic or coexist with asthma. One of these condition is the allergic rhinitis. Exposure to allergens in sensitized children or cigarette smoke can cause ongoing poorly controlled symptoms and steps to reduce exposure will help to improve control. A combination of intranasal steroid and anti- histamine may reduced asthma exacerbations (attacks of worsened asthma), and Leukotriene receptor antagonists are effective in treating both, asthma and rhinitis. There is a clinical data about beneficial effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy in children with allergy and asthma. Young patients with rhinitis receiving SIT are less likely to develop subsequent asthma or new allergic sensitivities. Talk with a pulmologist- allergist!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Asthma

I had asthma when I was a child at a young age. My first attack was when I was around 5 if I remember correctly. I went on two inhalers, one was a long-term deterrent and the other was an instant-fix which I used during an attack. I used them until about the age of 12, where I gradually stopped using them because I ceased to have asthma attacks or wheezing at all. Fast forward 9 years; I am now 21. For the past few months, I 've had shortness of breath walking around on campus (although I do carry a rather heavy backpack). I never used to have this problem. For the past month or so, I 've had wheezing on and off. About 2 weeks ago, it got really bad, and I went to the pharmacy to pick up an ``Asthma Mist '' inhaler (active ingredient epinephrine). I now need to use the inhaler 2-3 times a day, or I have breathing problems. Is there any reason I might be having problems out of the blue? The only thing I can think of is I 've gained about 20 lbs over the past 3 years since high-school. I 'm nowhere near obese, but I do have a few extra pounds I could lose. Might this be a reason? I 've been asthma-free for years, and it is an annoyance and embarrassing to need to use an inhaler just to breath correctly. I have not seen a doctor yet, but I am going to schedule an appointment this week. Any ideas? Thanks a ton.######It can come back... you probably should be on a daily preventer that could do away with the need for the rescue inhaler. Have it checked out.######It can come back... you probably should be on a daily preventer that could do away with the need for the rescue inhaler. Have it checked out.######Yes it can definitely come back. My grandfather had asthma severly as a child, disappeared when he was 18-19 and came back when he was 25 then disappeared again and came back when he was 70. It can come back hun. Its known as adult onset asthma. Ive had mine since I was a little girl. Take your meds and your be fine. x######That is almost exactly what happened to me, it 's really frustrating when it comes back. My doc told me that even a small cold or stresses (from school?) or a combination of many envoironmental triggers could be enough to bring it back. I 'm now on several preventative drugs and feel much better. I hope you feel better soon.######Asthma can lay dormant for years. There are many factors that bring it on such as stress, allergies, physical shape of the body etc.. I would say that it is very likely that you have developed a new allergy or that it could be coming on from stress of school or other things. Did you have bronchitis or the flu or anything when this started? I really think you should see a doctor and get on a daily prevenative of some sort and get a real albuterol inhailer vs. over the counter one. Best wishes, Amanda######you can develop allergies at any age and most of the time (at least that is what my doc told me) asthma is a result of an allergy trigger. I have noticed that after years of treating the asthma only, I started treating the allergies and my asthma symptoms were n't nearly as bad. Maybe there 's a theory there!######hi this has happened to me too, i had it when i was young, then it suddenly dissapeared when i was pregnant with my oldest daughter who is 5, and then just under a year ago it has come back again and it has come back worse than it was in the beggining, just when i thought it had gone forever i was wrong !!! i didnt know this could happen until i went to the doctors to find out why i was so short of breath, wheezing and coughing all the time, until they told me it could come back as it never really leaves your body######Hi, I had asthma as a child from the time I was 5 up until I was 17 then it went away. It came back last year when I was 34 and I just got another flare last night. I have a script for singulair which helps alot. I think its because I moved to another state and the pollen from the trees are different. Which I believe Im extremley allergic too. Hope I can get it to go away again. Well anyways I had alot of good years without it so I should be grateful.######I would see a pulmonologist so that you get good control of your asthma (regular docs do n't always do a good job of this). Asthma is a disease that is always present, even when you do n't feel symptoms. Certain triggers can cause you to feel symptoms (wheezing, tightness of chest, shortness of breath). If you need to use an inhaler for acute attacks (like the one you bought) more than a couple of time a month, then you probably need to go on an inhaled steroid. As the other person posted, you also should go on albuterol and not stay on the OTC you bought as albuterol is more specific to relieving bronchospasm without all the side effects of the OTC drug. No need to be embarrased about needing an inhaler. It does n't reflect on you as a person at all. Hope this helps!.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I 'm coughing up yellow phlegm, is that normal or do I have an infection? I dont/havent had any fevers. Thanks in advance.######Not typically unless you are doing something to agravate the asthma that produces a cough- such as cardio without premedicating that causes a cough. You will often have a productive cough in a case like that.######My asthma many times manifests as a relentless cough. It is generally non productive for me, but at times I cough up a whitish mucous.######thanks for the responses. i think i need to see my doc again. one more question... when people say their asthma `flares up ' what does that mean? coughing?######A flare up is just when your asthma is giving you trouble. It might be coughing spells, wheezing, shortness or breath or chest tightness. Normally when asthma flares up, you take some additional steps, such as using your rescue more often, increasing your med doses etc.. I am having a flare up right now because I have a cold. I noticed that I am coughing too much, and easily winded and a little wheezy. So I have started using my maxair by the clock, as per my action plan. If I 'm still having problems, I will add an additional med, and if that does n't do the trick, then I add prednisone.######thanks again for your response Sue. my asthma isnt `under control ' yet and i wheeze throughout the day if/when i inhale and/or exhale deeply. sometimes it causes me to cough but not what i would consider a coughing fit. should i be using my rescue inhaler at these times?######Not if the coughing is brief. What meds are you on and what is your action plan?######Currently I 'm only on Symbicort 160- 2 puffs twice a day. My doc wants me do a month of that followed by Symbicort 80 for a month and then to see him and see how I 'm doing. This is what I did the 1st time and it worked, I was off the inhaler for like 7-10 days, then I caught a cold and the wheezing came back. Is that considered an `action plan '? He never used those words. Oh and of course he gave me a rescue inhaler. Have n't had to use it yet.######No. So you are n't on a permanent plan from a pulmonologist, it would seem. Why have n't you used your rescue inhaler if you are having problems with wheezing. That 's when it should be used. Try one puff and see if it helps. Typically with asthma you hae a plan to up or change meds when you have a flare up or attack. See the sticky at the top of the Asthma page titled Asthma Action Plan to see what one is like.######No. So you are n't on a permanent plan from a pulmonologist, it would seem.

See the sticky at the top of the Asthma page titled Asthma Action Plan to see what one is like.######I havent used my rescue inhaler because the wheezing only happens when i inhale or exhale deeply and it doesnt really bother me; and when i cough it 's usually brief. so i should be using the rescue inhaler for those times? would you happen to know the average amount of times a day someone w/ asthma uses their rescue inhaler? i saw the Action Plan sticky and will read it right after i send this post. again, thanks for responding and for all the information Titchou. it is MUCH appreciated.######When asthma is under control, you should not need your rescue inhaler at all unless you need it before cardio (most asthmatic do). But if you have trouble breathing and take one puff and it helps, then that 's good. But typically you should n't ``need '' more than one or two puffs every few weeks or months. Are you inhaling or exhaling deeply due to cardio? Like walking up stairs, jogging, dancing? If so, you should do 2 puffs of the rescue inhaler, 60 seconds apart and 15 minutes before the cardio is to start.######no sorry, when i say `inhaling and exhaling deeply ' it 's not due to any activity, i just inhale and exhale deeply every now and then to see if the wheezing is there. but there are times when it 's quiet or in bed i hear/feel it just breathing normally. but there 's a twist now. last night i had chills and a fever so i went to the doc today and he put me on antibiotics. since i took the 1st one the `wheezing ' and coughing have just about disappeared. now i 'm thinking what i 've suspected all along... that it is/was a respiratory infection that didnt go away. or can it still be asthma? i should mentioned that when i did the PFT it didnt really show asthma so i 've been skepital about it ever since.######Wheezing is not always a sign of asthma just as lack of wheezing is not always a sign that you do n't have asthma. So, quit trying to see if you will wheeze just by breathing deeply or exhaling strongly. That 's not a valid test. The PFT is usually a pretty solid test for asthma. However, one can have asthma like symptoms due to certain illnesses but it goes away when well. Also, inhaled steroids are the treatment for many conditions and asthma is but one. Did you see a pulmonologist or your regular GP?######just to be clear, i 'm talking about deep, full breaths- nothing extreme. just to gauge the `wheezes ' to see if they 've lessened or not. i saw my GP who is also a pulmonologist..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I just wondered if anyone else gets this with asthma, i am planning on making an appointment with my doc in the NewYear. I would appriciate anyone can give me any info, I have always thought asthma gives you more of a prob with breathing and coughing than just wheezing. Thanks Saltire######I have had asthma all my life and I personally do not have a cough with it. For me it is more of a very tight feeling in my chest and lungs with heavy breathing and wheezing. Also for me I do n't get it if I am just laying around. . I have certain triggers-humidity, heavy running, dust, ect. Anyways maybe it is different for other people, but that is what I have always experienced. Also this time of year it is helpful for me to go outside where it is cool-it somehow helps my lung to relax (I also take an inhaler though). I hope this helped######Be carefull going out into the cold !! several times i 've had asthma attacks due to the cold (if it 's sever enoughoutside) but I do live in Canada...... beautifull but very cold some winters!And very humid summers that can trigge the same reaction.######Thankyou for your replies, i have just put off going to the doc til now cause it 's never got worse, i have felt it more than usual lately. It seems like i have always thought you would know you had asthma if you had it. My son has it, but it 's cough varient, and my daughter excercise induced, i just never thought at 38 i would start getting it. We 'll see what the doc says, thank again. Saltire######Hi Saltire, I have wheezing and lots of mucus in my throat. I do n't cough much, only to get the mucus up.I went to Dr and she said I had ``Allergy Induced Asthma ''. She started me on Singulair and it seems to be helping. Cold air really hurts my lungs and deep breathing hurts too. I think this may be different than some of the other Asthmas! I do n't use inhalers or nebalizers. They sent me for breathing test and the Dr said I had a lung deficiency, but not real bad. I have had allergies for a long time to a lot of things.Especially cleaning products. Shirley######I did n't mean cold air I said cool. And I also said that is what works for me everyone is different######I am beginning to think that asthma can flair up at any age after reading post on this forum and reading articles on the net. I was diagnoised with asthma at the age of 44, my dad's asthma began when he was in his 50's. I do n't wheeze unless I am really sick but I do have asthma attacks when I cough, and cough and cough uncontrollable. My triggers are cig smoke, perfume, laughing, and stress. I am just getting over my first case of pnemonia this winter and am not looking forward to the next few months. Does anyone ever have their doc put them on prednisone for the winter to avoid pnemonia?######I have made my doc appointment for next week. I will see what he says. I just think its weird that i have never been diagnosed with allergies or asthma, and now i have this wheezing everyday, i never feel like i have major trouble breathing, i do sometime feel like its harder than normal tho. I wonder too if this can be caused from your heart, my mother had a heartattack at 45 and i am 38 ca n't help but wonder. I appriciate everyones replies. Saltire######Hi, Mydoc appointment is wed, so hopefully find out whats going on. I have read that a lot of people with GERD can develop Asthma, anyone have this condition with asthma? I have it, so am now wondering if thats the prob, i am on treatment for it, and had surgery to correct the valves in my stomach. Would appreciate any info. Saltire######Do you eat/drink dairy products? My son had all these symptoms and they went away when we withdrew milk, yogurt, cheese, eggs, etc.... try it for two months and see if your wheezing does n't get better...######Hi yes i do eat those things, i will have to try going without and see if it helps. I went to the doc and he said he thinks it 's either asthma (he gave me meds) or could be to do with the trouble i have with my gastrointestinal tract. I am scheduled to get a scope done next week. I started singulair and i have to say i already feel a slight difference, not sure how soon that helps. He said my throat was looking irritated so that could be either reflux or allergies, will see how things go, thanks for your comments, nice to know there is people to talk to.

The first episode was in october 2002 (when I was 22), and the second only 8 weeks ago in june 2005. The first case was very severe as I did not know what was causing my abdominal pain, and the doctor I saw suggested I had a stomach virus that was circulating at the time. He gave me injections for the pain, but it continued into the next day and before long I began vomiting violently whenever drinking even small amounts of water. I was admitted to hospital once they discovered my amylase was up to 11,000, and was kept in over a week, the episode lasting 10 days in total. I had an ultrasound and an x-ray to search for gallstones, but none were found. I admit I used to be typical student and liked a drink, but never to constant excesses, and although I was honest with the consultant about how much I was drinking, they agreed it was nowhere near enough to cause pancreatitis, especially as I was only 22. I was advised to give up alcohol for 12 months â$ ``being young and stupid I only made it to 3 months, starting with the odd glass of wine, and I slowly resumed my normal alcohol consumption (around 20 units a week) without giving it too much thought. This continued until around a year ago, when I cut my drinking down by about half â$ ``I would have a few drinks during the week, and only have a big night out around once every couple of months. The second episode came 8 weeks ago, but I first thought the mild pain was due to a virus, as had suffered diaorrhea in the days leading up to it. I went to a & e to get my amylase checked as soon as the pain got worse and I knew what it was (you donâ$ t forget the pain of acute pancreatitis in a hurry!) . It came back as 4100, and again I was admitted. This time I was only in for 3 days, but was still in some pain when I was discharged. Again during my time in hospital I was given an ultrasound and x-ray but no cause was found. After this happened again I started to worry â$ ``my diet has never been unhealthy but I chose low fat options of everything and some organic where my budget would allow. I had no alcohol except one night out two weeks before my third episode, where I had around 10 units. I was called back for a ct scan 2 weeks later, but again nothing was found. The doctors were deciding what steps to take next, when I had the pain again. Then came the third time- I went straight to the hospital, and my amylase this time was only 1300. I was kept in for 5 days, during which yet another ultrasound and x-ray were done and nothing found and felt completely fine when discharged. I am now abstaining completely from alcohol, following a low fat, high carb (as suggested on other websites), completely organic diet, free from flavourings, colourings, preservatives and chemicals as far as possible, drink 3 litres of water, my only vice being 5 light slim cigarettes a day. I am tired a lot of the time, despite having at least 7 hours or more sleep a day. I am not, and have never been, on prescription drugs, and only take pain killers for headaches if absolutely necessary. Apart from the obvious, I am completely healthy. However I am medically overweight for my height, due to weight gained whilst on the contraceptive injection depo provera for a year and a half until april 2002, when I had a iud coil fitted. Plans are being made for an mri scan, but if nothing shows up I will probably be referred to a gastroenterologist for further tests. What I would like to know is, after 3 cases of acute pancreatitis before the age of 25: â$ cents am I likely to develop chronic pancreatitis or diabetes? â$ cents what tests should I request if they are not offered to me? â$ cents what other measures (apart from diet and alcohol avoidance) can I take to prevent this from recurring? I would really like to hear from anyone who has been in, or is in, a similar situation to myself, as every doctor and consultant I see is completely mystified and noone has a clue what is wrong with me. I just want my life back, without worrying about when I will be back in hospital next, and the horror stories about the results of regular attacks.######Hi! My daughter, 14, has been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Over the last 2 1/2 years she has undergone several test all within normal limits. Ultrasound- normal, ct scans, normal, and blood test, normal. However, she had hida scan performed of her gallbladder and this reveal dysfunction and had it removed (only part of the problem). She then underwent an ercp and this reveal sphincter of oddi dysfunction, very rare for children. Again, only part of the problem. The pancreas is the root of this evil. Do n't let them stop until you have an answer. If I had listened to the doctors, she would be the worst case of `nervous stomach/eating disorder ' known.######Hi, i was very interested to read your account- it sounds just like me, only I was 18 when it started. Like you, it took an age to get taken seriously, and they have now established that I have pancreas divisum (divided pancreas, you 're born with it, but it should n't be a cause on its own), no visible gallstones, no alcohol abuse (and you really have to work to get them to believe that when you 're in your 20s- they assume you 're out getting wasted every night!) . My situation now is that i 'm 32, and unfortunately I have continued to have about 2 attacks a year since 18. I am not diabetic, although there is a strong history of diabetes (1 and 2) in my family. I drink about two units a month, so barely anything, and I absolutely do n't think alcohol, or for that matter, food, have anything to do with triggering an attack. However, I do eat healthily, and exercise regularly. I 'd do this anyway- i 've always exercised, and never smoked (the one thing you must do is give up smoking- it 's got a host of links to damaging the pancereas, and our pancreases do n't need any excuse! It will also prove to the docs that you are doing everything you can). I live in the uk, and am about to go to liverpool to visit the research team there who specilaize in familial pancreatitis. One thing I have just come across this morning is a study at the bandolier site in the uk, which links selenium ace with possibly preventing further attacks. As I say, i 've only just seen this, but selenuim's a good thing to take anyway, and it 's worth a try! Let me know how you get on. It 's a tough disease, but the main things are getting the doctors to take you seriously and as the lady in the second message said, be pushy. It took them five years to diagnose my pancreatitis- and all it takes is a simple blood test. It will not go away on its own, so get in there and demand some attention! Good luck clare######Wow, that must be very hard having it twice a year- but at least you know what it is and can get straight to hospital so hopefully your enzymes do n't have a chance to get too high. Has it done permanent damage having so many attacks? Talk about doctors not understanding, my employers were also not happy as they thought oh she has pancreatitis it must mean she drinks loads hence its her fault she needs time off work! So now i 'm mostly self employed I run the risk of not being paid for a few days but at least I can avoid the constant pointless meetings about how much sick time I have had off and what I plan to do about it...! I did n't know smoking damaged pancreas that much, of course as if I need another reason to give up, I know it is no good whatsoever, but I have been good recently and a pack of 20 now easily lasts me over a week. Its a step in the right direction anyway! Yeah I have heard about the selenium thing a while ago, maybe studies were done in usa first, but its found in brazil nuts so if you like them its one less vitamin tablet to take! Pls let me know how you get on in liverpool. I have just been to hosp in croydon (possibly the worst in the uk!) to get my results of my recent mri scan, and when I walked into the room the ``doctor '' asked me why I was there !! Said I just want the results of scan, he asked if I was in pain, I said no I just want the results of scan, to which he asked if I would like him to examine me! By this point I was losing the will to live... He said he did n't have the test results, went out of the room for 10 minutes, came back and said they did n't find anything. How much I can believe him, I do n't know! Useless is not the word...######That 's what worries me most, really- every attack does some damage to the pancreases, so how much more attacks will it take before it packs up and we end up in a whole new world of pain? So, i 'm trying most things at the moment to stave off another attack. One thing which I have n't seen anyone discuss is when in the day their attacks come. Mine always, absolutely without fail, starts first thing in the morning. I either wake up with the pain, or it developed within an hour. I do n't know why this is- maybe it 's because the pancreas has been inactive over night and is starting to creak into action? I 'd be really interested in whether other people get it at the same time of day. What I want to avoid is it degenrating into constant, chronic pancreatitis. My mum is type 1 diabetic, so I do n't want to go there either! Also, we 'd like to have kids in the next couple of years- no desperate rush, but I think I need to start working out the risks. Pregnancy puts an extra load on the pancreas. I can find lots about people who havce had pancreatitis for the first time whilst pregnant, but have n't read anything yet on women with acute or chronic pancreatitis who 've been planning a family. Can anyone advise me? I 'm not expecting it to be an easy process, but at the moment I really do n't know what the chances and risks are. Hopefully the guys in liverpool may be able to help me with that as well. Clare######Yes thats what i 'm worried about two, I thought having 3 attacks was pushing my luck! 3 to you must seem great in comparison. My first two attacks started the same as yours, about an hour after waking up. With the third though I did n't get any pain until about 2pm, and was n't sure it was pancreatitis but took myself to hosp anyway due to history and amylase high at 1300 but lowest they had ever been. I do n't have any children so can not advise i 'm afraid. Hope you get some replies from women who can help with that, but out of interest how much extra stress does it put on the pancreas?######Yeah, it would really help to hear from some other people. There must be women out there who have had acute pancreatitis and wanted to have kids. I do n't really know much about this, which is one of the reasons why I want to get up to liverpool and get some info, but I know that it will be more complicated then usual. Apparantly one of the causes of ap is carrying (alhtough not necessarily having symptoms of) the cyctic fibrosis gene. One in 20 people in the uk carry the gene, so they 're going to test me for it, if I do have it, it 's really important that my husband gets tested as well, and if we both have it, that 's a whole new discussion. Apart from that, I just have n't had nine months without ap since I was 18, so the chances of me getting through a pregnancy unscathed are slim, I think, at the moment. As I understand it, all women are more at risk of getting ap when they are pregnant. I am assuming that that means that you and I are particularly at risk, and I have been told by one doctor that ap in pregnancy `usually ' results in miscarriage. But, that 's one doctors opion, and he was n't a specialist, so other dcotors may regard that as alarmist, or spot on. I do n't know. I could really do with some answers !! C######hey I read your posts and couldnt help but comment. . I had my first pancreatic attack when I was only 11 after that had 9 episodes in the time span of 2 years. After the two years I havent gotten any episode thank God, but to this date doctors havent found the cause. I went to Georgetown hospital, miami childrens hospital, Jackson Memorial, Baptist Hospital, John Hopkins hospital, Mayo Clinic in Rochester and tons of other hospitals and nobody could discover the cause. Now I am 20 years and havent suffered from a pancreatic attack, when i turned 19 I decided to try alcohol and since nothing happened i started to drink moderatly of course and rarely, my mom was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis and i have decided to stop drinking so i wont end up in the same situation. We had tests done to test our genes and hereditary pancreatitis was not the cause apparently. I am registered as an unknown cause of pancreatitis but I think its hereditary that is the only explanation. Just wanted to let you all know######I had my first attack of acute pancreatitis one night when i went to bed. I didnt think anything of it and just went to sleep. the pain went on for another day and I thought I had pulled something and on the 3rd day of the attack the pain started moving to my back. so I went to the er and they did an ultrasound and a ct scan which all came back normal. when they got my results back from my blood panel my lipase was 10 times higher then it should be and so was my amylase. so I was in the hospital for 11 days and was sent home on pain meds and a low fat diet. The pain felt like it was going away and then 2 weeks later i started having the pain again but this time it was worse and I had started vomiting. so i went back to the er and the doctor said there wasnt anything they could do for me there and that he wanted me to go out of town to a different hospital where they could give me the right treatment. I was at the new hospital for 9 days and they didnt find any signs of gallstones and sent me home. I had a follow up with this new doctor and he did some lab test and my lip and amy was 5 times higher then what they should have been but lower then what they were when i had my attack and he gave me some pain killers and sent me home. I have 3 more attacks since the first 2 and this is all in a year. What do I do next since these doctors dont seem to want to help me get to the bottom of this..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

Abdominal Ultrasound, CT scan with and without contrast were normal. Day 2 lipase went to 1055 (ref 73-393). I was finally released since on day 3. My discharge papers said Acute Pancreatitis.

More possibilities below: Idiopathic pancreatitis under age 40 Quote: Extensive or invasive evaluation is usually not recommended in those with a single episode of pancreatitis who are younger than 40 but some reports recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) even after one attack if the cause is not clear to look for pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors at or near the ampulla, microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct, and early chronic pancreatitis. Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich, than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E.. When im with my friends. I 've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana? Well, heres to everybody whos had to go through this damn disease, life aint over yall: wink:######Hi, i just wanted to say- be careful! I first developed symptoms at 18, was diagnosed at 25 and i 'm now 32, and i 've had 25 attacks, three within the last three months. It sounds as is your attacks are really mild- you 'll know if you need to go to hospital- because the pain gets way too bad to cope with! I do n't think my ap is linked to alcohol either, but I have cut it out, just to be sure. If you have to drink, I tink you 're better off with `long ' drinks such as wine, beer, etc.. Do n't drink spirits! And, sorry to say, you 've got to stop smoking, completely. It sends all your risk levels through the roof, and you ca n't afford it. You are already at an increased risk of cancer of the pancreas- very deadly, so you have to minimise all the other risks! Above all, do n't mess with this illness. I 've had it for a long time; sometimes it leaves me alone for 18 months, other times it hits again and again, and just takes over. Every time you 're ill your pancreas gets damaged, and you need it to last you the rest of your life. When you see what ap can do to you, it gives you a new appreciation- it can get much, much worse, so play by the rules in order to keep yours as mild as possible for as long as possible. I know it 's boring- having ap when you 're young is a real pain, but treat it with respect! C######thats good advice my son was diagnosed at 16 he is now 23 and been in and out of hospital allot and once in icu whilst on holiday in turkey, he dont touch alcohol and he still gets flare ups its a very scary illness######If you want to ward off pancreatitis, you need to stop drinking completely and smoking also. I have had to deal with pancreatitis for many years now, but more so in the last nine months. I was on a feeding tube for four months, and did n't think I was going to live through the last two attacks. Believe me, you do n't want to do anything that is going to make pancreatitis a part of your life. The quality of my life is not very good at all at the moment, and I would n't wish this on anyone. I have never been a drinker, but I do n't see why you ca n't just order a ``virgin '' when out with your friends......############every time u drink ur amylase and lipase will increase if the food you cosume contains a lot of fat pain may increase.as for ur marijuna aftr consuption u feel hungery and consume more food which might cause pancreatitis.######Hello, drinking with pancreatitis is always a bad idea !! And yes it can be avoided even when out with friends. Become the regular designated driver !! The attacks of pain you have following every time you drink should tell you it is a bad idea... With each acute attack you have, you are one step closer to chronic pancreatitis. And believe me- you do not want to be chronic !! My first attack happened when I was 8 years old (now 48). I have been chronic for the last 6 years. It is life stealer !!! It do n't kill you but it will sometimes make you wish it did. It is disabling (i have not been able to work since 2001). The pain is 24/7 and no matter what you do it never goes away. Yet you also get attacks when the pain is unbearable. Additionally chronic pancreatitis leads to many other disorders- the worse of which is type 1 brittle diabetes- uncontrollable diabetes. This comes with all the side effects of diabetes. Malabsorption is another problem. You can literally starve to death, even though you are eating. It causes all kinds of vitamin and mineral inbalances with come with their own problems. Please think twice before you take another drink. Each drink puts you closer to being chronic... And there are many more problems associated with chronic pancreatitis that I am not listing here. Reeann############Hi all. I 've just had my first attack of Acute Pancreatitis. I was rushed to ER and they gave me morphine, put me on a drip, gave me loads of antibiotics and would n't let me eat. I must admit it was pretty scary- I went in to shock and very nearly died. So I 've just got out of hospital and I do n't know very much about what to do next. The doctors did n't give me any advice except to only eat light meals ?! I see that alcohol is bad- that 's ok can live without that! Can anyone give me any advice? Am I likely to get it again? Thank you... Emma######research and learn to eat, and be devoted to, a non fat diet. I did not say low fat, I said non fat. It is the most important thing and I do n't see it on these posts. Maybe people do n't know how to eat to live with this disease. Please google non fat diets. Work up some recipes you like and stick to them, and carry a tupperware container of these foods with you if you go out. NO ALCHOHOL whatsoever. Do n't even smell it. Put mustard on your sandwich, no cheese no mayo. No egg yolks, buy egg whites in a container and scramble. maybe a slice of non fat cheese on the top. No butter at all, not light butter, nothing of the sort. No birthday cake or pastries, have angel cake instead. Spend a year working on the non fat diet and you will adapt very quickly. Never go off it. this is the way you will live from now on. It takes attention but you will be able to live with it easily once you get the hang of it. Take yours with you, is my advice.############i had an episode of acute pancreatitis about 4 years back. It was intense pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the back.my glucose level was also slightly high. sinnce then i have stopped drinking completely. thereafter i never had any problems whatsoever.my glucose also is normal.but thereafter my calcium level is always low. now i am taking calcium supplements 3 times a day. the absorption is very poor. i also have to take vitamin d. can i now start drinking occasionaly.######My boyfriend has been hospitalized 4 times in the last year for pancreatitis but he continues to drink, now the doctor said this can kill him is that true? He does not seem to get it he thinks that they are just make things up can this kill him if he does not stop drinking ???######I 've had a very serious acute pancreatitis attack 3 days ago... the pain got worse throughout the day and at 1am in the morning I was n't able to take it anymore and asked my husband to bring me to the ER. I stayed in the ER for 6 hours, got an IV, they took my blood, urine samples, and did an ultrasound. It did not take them too long to figure out that I had acute pancreatitis, but they said they can not figure out why- I do n't really drink (maybe once in 4 months ??) and I do n't have gallstones- two of the most common causes for acute pancreatitis. I asked my mother if she had symptoms like that before or if it was in my family, and actually she said she had something like that before, similar pain, but back then they were not able to give her a correct diganosis (40 years ago). I am only 25, and had pain in my stomach before, however, I never took it seriously or it was never that bad that I had to go to the doctor or to the hospital. I have n't had any solid food in 3 days, I am scared to eat because of the pain. I am drinking lots of water and broth, but even decaf tea or chicken broth gives me pain, not too much, but I can tell that it takes time to get better. I got pain reliever like vicodin, which knock me out. I wonder if I can ever go back to my regular diet, I never really cared what I ate before, it was usually a very balanced diet, and sometimes it happened to be a bit fatty/oily. I will have a follow up appmt with my doctor next week and I 'll try to find out more if I have to adjust my diet from now on. Is it normal to feel pain when drinking broth/ tea after acute pancreatitis?######If drink was the cause of your acute pancreatitis, give it up, because when- and it will be when- you develop chronic pancreatitis, you 'll remember all those blase evenings of getting trashed with absolute regret, while being in total agony in the present and unable to think clearly about your fearsomely shortened future. Drink can be fun, until it is n't, and when it 's threatening your wellbeing, just give it up. Seriously. i ca n't put into words the extent to which you 'll rue the day you carry on.######hey guys.... . im 16 yrs old i have had two attacks of acute pancreatitis lol its acyually funny im sitting at mayo clinic now getting a bunch of tests done for this... i was first told i hace this two weeks before my 16 birthday and have since had to make a lot of lifestyle changes... i used to drink about 3 times a month with my buddys but havnt had a drop of alchahol since my first aattack... i also used to smoke cicgarettes (about a pack a day) but quit after my second attack... both times i was put on a low fat diet which is 50 grams of fat per day... for all who dont know that is about 5 tablespoons of mayonase !!!!! i was recently told i could continue a normal diet but have chosen not to... i guess i really dont want to take the risk of getting it again... for 1 it is way painfull... i dont know how many times i blacked out bc of it... and for two i am now repeating a semester of my sophmore yera bc i missed so much school and i just kind of gave up. . plus it really isnt worth the week in the hospital and not eating for three days.... if you ever want to know more or want to ask n e questions you can message me... ttyl guys....######i had ap to. almost died. multiple organ failure followed along with adult respitory distress syndrome. ap usually doesnt go this far but for me it did... my pancreas shot poison into my body. . making my lungs shut down... do i drink now? yes i do... just not as much... i do not expierence stomach pain when i do it though but am always watching for any sign of it, cause then id stop. Life goes on. Doctors will naturally tell you not to do it... but i dont worship that religion and a doctor is not a priest for me as it is for so many others. Listen to your inner most voice. . and it will tell you what you are allowed and what you are not. Pay attention to pain, it is there to warn you and tell you something is not right. I always had warning signs but unfortunately i did not listen to them... i thought drinking more would make the pain go away... and before you judge me... let me say this... im sick of encyclopidia people who believe everything they are told You have a disease... you must be aware of it, but you must live and be merry as well... be the designated drive... ha! some people arent that boring If i sound like a ahole... fine.... but im sick of hearing stupid advice that not based on fact the truth is they dont know where the limit it so they say dont do it at all... i say dont do it at all if you are too stupid to find your limit... but if not, find your limit and listen to your body...... and live and laugh... life is too short to go through it trying to prolong by erasing all the little pleasures... those who want the last years where u pee your bed and cant move... you go ahead and live healthy to die long.... i dont want to die long and im sick of your opra, self help answers######I am writting even though I it may be premature to do so. But I have been devasted by the news at the docs. I have had some discomfort in my right side abdomen just under the edge of my rib cage. I had an ultrasound done and the doc told me I have a cyst in my pancreas... now I am scheduled for a CT scan and I am freaking out of what it might be. The doctor has put a rush on it. . and this has made me even more nervous. I drink but mostly on weekdays, and usually have a beer daily... what is going on ??? I have had heart burn and bloating as well for some time, and many times loose stools. Guess I am looking for good news or something comforting... anyone know what is going on and should I worry ???######A Brief Journey of my pain In January 2010 I experienced my first symptoms of pain which turned out initially to be jaundice followed by a diagnosis of gallstones which meant an admission into hospital in early February 2010. After my first admission eating fatty foods was a key cause of the episodes of pain and was told by the consultant to have my gallbladder out 6 weeks ago but instead gave me 3 months to decide as I was not in a fit state of mind to decide whether I really wanted it so was expected to give him my decision on 13th July this year. I have continued to cut down on fatty foods and have lost almost 3 stones in weight since the beginning of the year, I am not grumbling about the weight loss however I would have preferred to do it differently avoiding pain attacks relating to food intake. I now eat substantially less and better variety of diet along with gentle exercise a few times a week, these pain occurrences have totally changed my life, clothes are loose and although I was t-total before now I will be for the indefinite future as I donâ$ t want food and alcohol relating to further pancreatitis so overall despite the discomfort in hospital I am much healthier and happier. Events superseded my decision to have my gallbladder out late July 2010 so in May this year was admitted again with gallstone induced pancreatitis which was extremely painful resulting a week or so later with my gallbladder removed. I was petrified of the operation but I had it done as I could not bear any more pain so I took the risk of general surgery via key hole. Waiting 8 hours in squelching UK heat was not pleasant especially when you are nil by mouth. On 29th June I was discharged from the consultant only to find a week later I was admitted with a further episode of an infection of the pancreas spending seven nights at the local hospital. Now I hope they have gone for good so when I see the consultant surgeon at the end of August I can try and be discharged for a second time. This time I had severe hiccups, excess sweating and lots of vomiting adding to jaundice, gallstone and acute pancreatitis, why do things in halves, all this when I donâ$ t drink, smoke, eat pretty healthily and have good health yet I have all of this unlucky or what.

Mark Crossley######hello all im 25 years old, i drank wine everyday for the past two years at least a bottle maybe two. i was jus released from the hospital today for pancreatitis. my levels were all off my pancreas was at 10,000 my potassium, and other electrolytes were low. i was in the hospital for 5 days the dr. told me i should not drink anymore as i could possible develop cronic pancreatitis. my question is did anyway experience a bloating around their abdomen or weight gain in that area after being released from the hospital? i was fed thru an iv and given pain pills so i cant understand what the reason would be for the weight gain. thanks in advance######Yes it is very normal to have bloating and gassy feeling when you are released from the hospital and it lasts for weeks until it is finally gone. Your stomach can look and feel huge! I am not sure about the weight gain except I know that the pain killers they give you cause you to be constipated and you need to be on stool softeners most times. I have been in the hospital 8 times with this and struggle to quit drinking but know if I do n't that I will develop chronic pancreatitis which will eventually kill me.######I just got out of the hospital today after four days in there. I was on the IV the whole time and I gained 10 pounds and my stomach is totally bloated still. I did not have any food till this morning, which was some of that hospital egg stuff. It did not hurt after eating it so my doc let me go home. The couple of doctors that I talked to said that I can go back to my regular diet (which consist of meat, dairy and junk, no fruits of vegies) as soon as I felt comfortable. They also told me to stop drinking for two weeks and then I can drink again. I do not drink every day and only have a couple of beers unless it is some sort of weekend away, then I can drink a lot.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago. I was in Tanzania when I got it and was rushed into hospital because the pain was unbearable. After 3 days there I flew back to England and remained in hospital for another 10 days. During my stay I had ultra sound scans, a CT scan, a cannular put in and over 25 blood tests. I wasnt allowed to eat or drink for 5 days. They said they thought it might be the malaria tablets I had been taking- doxycycline, but they couldnt confirm it and wrote down it was idiopathic on my discharge form. Ive been told I can try drinking again after 3 months but I 'm pretty terrified of it coming back- I cant handle that pain again! I think i will drink in the future if I can, just not binge drinking, which my doctor said should be fine.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago.

All of my symptoms seem to corralate with yours. I have not been diagnosed with ap.My gi doc doesnt seem to know what I have.He seems to think I have to much ``stress ''.

My brother has just been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, and as I 'm new to all this I was looking for a little help on his prognosis. Basically he was initially diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, but they found that some of his pancreas had ``died '' so this diagnosis was changed to chronic pancreatitis. He has therefore stopped drinkng completely (the cause was alcohol). He is 28 years old. He suffered bouts of pain after drinking previously, but now has no pain and has not had any for months (ie is not constantly or regularly in pain). Based on this latesgt info can someone give me a rognosis of his case? I know it differs from person to person, but it is hard to find out really where he stands from reading the web only, most of which is retty scary to read. Any help is appreciated. Jack######My wife had a similar problem. Talk to your GI Doc about how much damage has been done. She quit drinking as well and had no problems, then had a glass of wine New Years and major attack. Also fatty foods and high fiber uncooked vegetables will cause problems we have found as. So diet and abstinence from alcohol have seemed to be her keys. From what I have read, there is an increased chance of diabetes as well as an increased chance of pancreatic cancer with each episode. So, it is best to get a good GI doc and take his/her advice seriously..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

I am not as physically fit as I used to be but I still swim and play basketball weekly. My diet consist of fatty foods and I hardly drink beer but when I do it 's binge drinking, around 5-6 beers about once or twice a month. I went to ER complaining of stools without any pain at all, so they ran stool test, blood work and ct scan and everything was fine but my lipase levels were EXTREMELY elevated at 1700. They admitted me to hospital for a few days and I responded well to clear liguid diet the first day, I was retested and my lipase next morning was at 1050, still high but a significant reduction. Next morning it jumped to 1130. I was shocked and was upset that the lipase was not going down. All my lipids, liver panels and cbc were normal. GI doc said he 's certain it was acute pancreatitis. He then ordered a 2nd CT scan this time with oral and IV contrast and once again, it was clear but GI doc not did talk to me about results, he sent nurse in to send me home. They sent me home only telling me to lay off alcholol and see him in 2 weeks. Why would any responsabile doctor, especially GI send someone home with a dangerous lipase of 1130? I was shocked again. This still left me with many unanswered questons. Maybe you guys can help me out. 1. I get abdominal pain and sometimes mild diarrhea after drinking moster energy drinks, dairy and iced coffee drinks. Pain always lasted for a less than 5 mins and relieved after bowel movement, I never had pain that persisted for hours. I also associated this brief pain with IBS. No D if I stay away from those trigger foods. Does pancreatitis always create severe abominable pain lasting for more several hours? 2. How can a doctor tell if it 's acute or chronic pancreatitis? Can you have multiple acute attacks or is more than one attack considered chronic? From what I read CP eventually becomes less painful due to failing pancreas and amalyse levels are normal. Since I have no pain, I assume it 's CP and those small bouts of 5 minute pains were pancreatitis flare ups. 3. Anyone have insight of survival rate and lifespan with this condition if treated properly with low fat diet, exercise and abstinence from alcohol? I read it reduces lifepspan 10-20 years for any cp patient. 4. Does chronic marijuana use contribute to pancreatitis? I smoke tons of marijuana and I just switched to edibles after diagnosis, even though GI doc think it has nothing to do with it. Thanks.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

Had what was thought of to be my first diverticulitis attack. At the same time, I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I had two issues going on at once. The CT scan at ER stated that I had inflammation on portion of descending colon. The results stated Ischemic colitis could be reason, but my gastro thinks it may be due to diverticulitis, as I do have diverticulosis. (and because at my age of 44, didnt think I was a candidate of ischemic colitis). The ER never addressed the inflammation. I then had gallbladder surgery and then pain in intestines and I was put on Cipro and flagyll. Im going on my 8th day of meds, and I feel so horrible and tired, and have bad diarrhea. But whats really bugging me is Im getting pain on left side under rib, where I believe inflammation was. Its a nagging pain. Never occurred before attack. Just curious as to how long it takes to heal if it 's truly diverticulitis. Im assuming if I had any dangerous problems, Id be bleeding and keeled over. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!######Hi, You say you had pancreatitis in November, have you had it checked out with the pain you 're having anymore. I am 72 years old and found out I had chronic pancreatitis when I was 68. I realize now I had my first attack of acute pancreatitis before I was 18 years old and several more acute attacks through the years. My ER trips I was told I had Gastritis. I was also told I had gallbladder disease when I was 22 years old but it was quite a number of years more before I had my gallbladder removed. When my gallbladder was removed I still remained having pain in my right side. I also would have full-blown stomachaches, usually most of the evening after dinner. My MD had upper GIs and all the tests he thought of done and could n't find anything wrong so he labeled me as having right sided diverticulitis. So for years this is what I thought was wrong with me and I just lived with it Then when I was 68 I woke up one morning with a stomach ache straight in the middle of my stomach, one bad enough I could n't hardly sit still I was rocking back and forth. I went to the emergency room and this time they diagnosed me with acute pancreatitis and said I needed to see a doctor and get my pancreas checked, as my brother had died with pancreatic cancer. I live close to John Hopkins so that is where I got a doctor and went and they went down and checked my pancreas to make sure I did n't have cancer and I was told I had a disease pancreas. So now what I have is chronic pancreatitis due to having so many pancreatic attacks not knowing what they were. You say your pain is on the left side and my pain was on the right side but your pancreas is really in the middle in the back of your stomach so it makes me wonder. I would not go as far to say I would guess you have pancreatitis, but one never knows I guess and since you have had it it would be wise for you to watch out and not get into much more trouble with that like I have. I am wondering if it can hurt on the right side, can it not hurt on the left side also. They told me I had to really cut down on fats and dairy products and since I have done so I have way less pain and I 'm doing much better. I really wish you well and hope to hear what your problems turn out to be. Seeing that you have had pancreatitis it really crossed my mind how many years I have spent trying to find out what was causing all of my pain and also wanting to warn you to be careful and watch your pancreas close so you would not be into chronic pancreatitis like I have. Much luck to you and I hope you recover and feel better soon. Shirley######Wow, you have had quite a journey !! What I initially felt on Nov 26 was cramps, thought I had to go to bathroom, but I thought my intestines would explode. God awful. Then I suffered through next 24 hours before I went into ER on my own. They found I had pancreatitis. I had soreness in that area, but not severe pain like in the intestines. Its strange, I had two things going on at once. I am curious about the thickened bowel area of the descending colon. My uncle is dying from colon cancer and while I am young, I still worry. This is all an enigma. I went to the ER with intestinal pain and dx with pancreatitis. Not sure if the two are connected. Dont think they are. I believe the pancreatitis is gone. But I am sore from under my rib cage down. Could be the tail, who knows. I know its not my gallbladder, cause it 's gone! Im sorry you suffered for so long. What do you do for your disease? best wishes!######Hi there, I certainly hope you are feeling some better by now, it 's pretty miserable when you suffer with stomach pain so long. I can well understand why you 're so concerned, that C word is always at the bottom of our thoughts. I have no idea what diverticulitis feels like as I never apparently really had it. What I have to do with this chronic pancreatitis is watch my diet eat very little meat and dairy products and that is really cut my pain down. I will tell you the pain that it can cause can make you rollup and roll and I really have n't had an attack like a real real attack, to end up in the ICU, as many of persons have. I have read some horror stories of people with chronic pancreatitis on the Internet and it tells me from what I have had I certainly hope to never get there. Not long after I found out I have this I almost headed to the emergency room one night I was pretty doubled up in pain but I managed to get over the worst and go to bed. I 'll tell you, you watch every bite you put in your mouth after you feel the pain it can. cause. I have considered myself quite lucky since I 've known I 've had it from what I hear and have read about other people. Of course chronic pancreatitis can turn into cancer also so that is something you have to watch out for. My brother died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 52 and he had never been sick for a day in his life until he got that.How we never know what will happen next and when we get stomachaches it 's so hard to guess what 's going on in there. Please keep in touch so we can all know what 's going on with you. I just pray that you get it resolved soon. Good luck! Shirley.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

I crave sugar all the time, sometimes I have drastic energy crashes before I even know I 'm hungry. Recently my vision has gotten blurry, sometimes it is so hard to see that it gives me bad headaches. I know nothing about diabetes. Should I be tested? Thank you for your help.######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or ther other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. Curious. Rose######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or the other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. If you want to rule out diabetes, your doc should help you discover what is going on with you. Hope you can resolve this. Keep us posted. Rose######One doctor immediately said chronic pancreatitis, since my levels have been so high but have rollercoastered over the past couple years. But they ca n't find a cause or a cure for it. All catscans and MRI's have shown everything to be normanl, no blockages, stones, or inflammation.######Pancreatitis and diabetes can be related. If you have chronic pancreatitis, your pancreas is apparently comprimised and not functioning at it optimum level. Have you been referred to an endochronologist? When I was in hospital and not able to have anything by mouth for 10 days, on day 6, they introduced I.V. nutrition. This I.V. bag of `food ' was mostly sugar, with electrolytes and other vital supplements. I have not previously been diagnosed a diabetic, although I was borderline gestational diabetic with my first child and not with the second. The I.V. food bag, caused my blood sugars to be all over the place. I had insulin shots every day- multiple times a day- while the food bag was on the I.V. pole. They kept increasing the insulin in the I.V. food bag, but still needed to give me the shots- my body just was too busy trying to heal the pancreas to regulate blood sugars too. I believe that my insulin levels are not right yet and it has been a month that I 've been out of the hospital now. I need to see my doc/intern and get blood sugars checked as well. Just saw the gastro doc and still have a couple issues from that hospitilization episode yet to take care. I would make sure the pancreas is able to produce the insulin you need- You need to be proactive about it. Keep us posted Rose######I am not a medical professional but I do know from experience that yes diabetes and pancreatitis can be related. I have type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with chronic pancreatitis. They dont know if I was born with the chronic pancreatitis yet but looking back on my life long medical history it looks like I may have been. This is likely to be the reason why I am a double diabetic. So far lots of places I have read about online say that both chronic and acute pancreatits can lead to diabetes.######Thank you for all of the responses everyone. I have never been able to get a doctor to send me to an endocronologist, nor could I get one to accept me, because my blood sugar is always normal. My amylase and lipase are always a mess, but I ca n't seem to find anyone who wants to do anything other than take out my gallbladder. =-LRB- I 've given up for now..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

My husband was admitted to the hospital 13 days ago with gallstones and severe acute pancreatitis. He had his gallbladder removed a week ago and all went well. He is feeling much better, has more energy, and has little pain. His lipase and amylase numbers are down, but his white blood cell count is still high. Today he had fluid removed from around his pancreas. We are still waiting on the test results, though the doctor said he did n't see a lot of pus in the fluid, and no blood. He has type 2 diabetes but was not on any medication for it yet. Now he is on 2 types of insulin. So, I have 3 questions. Hopefully someone out there can answer. 1. Will his diabetes probably be permanently worse because of this? 2. Why would his WBC still be high if the other numbers are coming down? 3. Is he still in danger with the pancreatitis?

I am currently taking 1tblsp in 8oz water with 1tsp honey. It does suppress my appetite and aids digestion. I 've lost 5lbs so far, you still need to eat well and exercise, but it does help a lot. Here 's some further info for ya: A bottle of this remarkable liquid probably sits in your pantry, used occasionally when a recipe calls for it. But this inexpensive, unglamorous condiment is a source of some powerful health remedies. Vinegar contains many important vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids: calcium, potassium, beta-carotene, magnesium and iron, to name a few. Due to recent research results, doctors and scientists are now calling it a ``functional '' food- a food that not only is nutritious but also can help prevent and protect against disease. Here are a few benefits of different types of vinegar: Apple Cider Vinegar: Encourages cell and tissue growth; helps transmit nerve impulses and enriches blood; helps the stomach to produce hydrochloric acid, which aids digestion and helps prevent digestive disorders as we age. Red Wine Vinegar: Flavonoid-rich, it can help lower cholesterol levels, lessening the risk of heart attack, stroke and high blood pressure. Balsamic Vinegar: This vinegar is high in anti-oxidants and potassium. And here are some therapeutic uses for vinegar: Apply apple cider vinegar to burns to alleviate inflammation, swelling and prevent blisters. Clear congestion by inhaling the vapor from a steaming pot of water with several spoonfuls of apple cider vinegar. Soothe a sore throat by gargling a 50-50 solution of warm water and vinegar. Stop hiccups by sipping a glass of warm water mixed with a teaspoon of vinegar. Alleviate athlete's foot by rinsing feet several times a day with plain or apple cider vinegar. The acid of the vinegar helps top fungus growth and relieves itching. Fight off menopausal night sweats by sponging yourself down with apple cider vinegar before going to bed. And do n't forget to use it mixed with oil to dress a salad, or mixed with oil as a dip for bread instead of that pat of butter!

I started taking apple cider vinegar on Monday and went to the doctor on Tuesday and my blood pressure went down 128/86. I 'm not sure if this worked that fast or the machine in the grocery store was wrong. Does anyone have any idea if using apple cider vinegar works on lower your blood pressure?######YES! Check out my other posts. In a nutshell, my dad SWEARS by garlic & Apple cider. He adds these 2 into almost all of his foods. He actually drinks a teaspoonful of apple cider every morning. He 's been weaned off comletely of one of his meds, and his other bp med has been reduced to 25 mg once a day. Not bad at all! He also has a treadmill & a medical device called the resperate to help lower his blood pressure. ANYTHING to avoid pills !!! Veronicca######I take apple cider vinegar capsules (1500 mg.) I started taking teaspons a day for my hands that were cracking and bleeding. After starting on ACV, the problem went away. My daughter bought me some capsules. They seem to work as well. I had an episode of high blood pressure at work. I was allergic to the Lisenoprill, so I tried increasing my ACV capsules and my blood pressure is much better.######My grandmother told me about that old home remedy of Apple Cider Vinger to lower blood pressure. Make sure your not buying the one that 's used for cooking, because that 's very harsh on the stomach. Health food stores and places like GNC have the drinking kind, that called apple cider vinegar mother's core. And they also have the herbal pills. Try drinking it daily with lots of water, and try to get that bottom number down some more.######The explanation is farely simple. Apple pectin is a natural circulatory health boost. It helps your body clean its own veins and arteries out. Vinegar is a natural metabolism boost, its very acidic, so your body speeds up the metabolic process to get the vinegar out of the stomach (thats how all metabolic medicines work). You could get the same result from eating a couple apples with a chili pepper too. Or apple with Guarana extract. Vinegar is just very soft on the stomach. The higher metabolism gets the apple pectin moving quick through your body because of increased blood flow, therefore delivering more pectin to more areas before it has time to decay. This same method also helps in weight loss, because as your metabolic rate speeds up your body needs sufficient energy to boost itself, using carbohydrate reserves (fat) to fuel the fire. In the process reducing the amount of reserve needing to be maintained, which reduces strain on the heart. In other words, Apple cider vinegar is probably the best method for health and circulatory control. An apple a day keeps a heart attack away. I suggest getting the tablet extract form. I get mine at wal-mart, target, any health food store anywhere. Its listed as a weight loss diet, but do n't think its anything like ephedrine. Far different. Its a lot easier to carry around and take, plus I always found it pretty hard to swallow down any type of vinegar. Mind you eating a real apple and drinking real vinegar is the method with the best results. The tablet form works for me. Anyway. Hope I was of some help.######ACV is n't bad if you use a sweetener like Stevia. I have tried several flavors of it, and am currently using the Lemon drop flavor. Very nice and lemony. I buy mine from amazon grocery. I take between 2teaspoons-1 tablespoon a few times a day. With the stevia (between 4-8 drops) and 8 ounces of water. I notice when I do n't take it, that my joint pain comes back, so it also works as an anti-inflammatory. Buy the Braggs brand or any other that show ``Raw organic apple cider vinegar. '' You can buy it at most health food stores, Whole Foods, Wild Oats, even in some supermarkets `health food ' section. Important note: If you take the ACV, do not take that aspirin a day. The ACV helps thin the blood, the way the aspirin does, so you do n't need both. And long term use of the aspirin a day makes the stomach bleed, and that 's never good.######If ACV is effective treatment for high blood presure, why my doctor never advise me to do so. I have been using my doctor medication for almost 20 years and the result is the same.My blood presure goes ups and down.######Because Apple Cider Vinegar is a CURE. Doc and big pharmacy would n't make money off of cured people. If doctor prescribed medicine actually worked why would anyone need to be on a medicine for a lifetime.

ACV prevent convertion of carbohydrate into sugar by destroying digestive enzymes like lipase, amylase etc.. I put 1 tsp of ACV into a eight oz glass of water and take it before meal. My sugar level went down from 170 to 117. Try it. But, if you eat sugar and already sweetened food, it may not work, as it only prevents conversion of carbohydrate. It is working for my fine.######Have you checked out cold pressed virgin cocount oil? There is some data that suggests using coconut oil in your diet will help you get your blood sugar regulated.

You have 20 years documented history. Try for one month using acv and see if it makes a difference. If yes you have proof. Hope you get to stop the pills soon.######Why would you continue doing the same thing for 20 years in order to continue experiencing the same results? Obviously, you do not have high BP because your body is in short supply of BP medicine. While ultra high BP may warrant a short term course of BP meds in an emergency, the ultimate goals should be to correct the problem naturally and get off all meds. Has it never occurred to you that the medical establishment does not want you to stop taking BP meds and actually cure your high BP through diet and exercise? If all patients ate right and exercised, supplemented with quality whole food products, they would lose billions of dollars annually.######well my blood pressure was 149 over 97 and I began taking apple cider vinegar two teaspoons in the morning with water and two in the evening with water...

Mine can vary by at least 30mm- BP needs to be done at the same time and conditions every day for some time to gauge effects. On the ACV thing I tried a `clear ' one from Health Food Store that said it could be taken as a tonic- I took a tsp in a smoothy and that was ok but when taken in apple juice, with all the fibre in, was far too sharp and made my throat rather raw. Did n't feel right- was this just starting pains ??######wow !!!! i have a large jug of apple cider vingar because i read about the great things it does, its suppose to help you loose weight also. now i m going to ignore the taste and start taking it again.######Hi trv, I do n't think you actually used pure apple cider vinegar (with the Mother) which is dark and should be diluted one tablespoon in a pint of water. This can even be a little rough on the throat if not properly diluted. I suspect that you might have used ordinary vinegar which can be extremely rough on the throat. Try Braggs Pure apple cider vinegar.######Yeah Samdy- I do n't think this `mutha ' had the `mother ' though the shop where I got it is very good usually. But for the tonic thing on the label I would n't have bought it. Substituting it back by using with pressed apple did n't do the trick. I will try H+B for the real thing, or maybe order online in the end- and look out for Braggs if available in UK.######I started taking acv a week ago. One teaspoon in a small glass of water. I 've found that drinking it through a straw, thereby bypassing the teeth and most of the tongue makes it easy. So far I have definately noticed a marked reduction in appetite, especially for sweet things incuding alcohol. Will wait another week before I weigh myself but am confident of weight loss. Also, I have just checked my pulse rate. It was 58, as opposed to 68 two weeks ago.I feel this is beneficial as far as blood pressure is concerned.######Some of you wanting to lower your blood pressure using raw organic apple cider vinegar (ACV) such as Braggs brand, or Spectrum have to realize that you must make other changes as well. Like cutting down on salt which is# 1. Plus watching what you eat and cutting out the high saturated fatty foods, and exercising daily even if it 's just walking a half hour after a meal in the evening. You will see great results if you implement all of the above, plus reduce your stress levels. I also take a Hawthorne supplement a few times a day. It helps with circulation problems. Plus now and then some Dandelion extract. That tastes great mixed in some water. The ACV is best with a little sweetener such as liquid stevia or honey or agave nectar. Whichever you prefer. Helps it all go down smoothly and tastier.######Back in 1974 I was very sick with a strep throat, which created complications with Kidneys. I lear n't the only effective prevention of Streptococci Bacilus is to include Apple Cider Vinegar every day in your diet. This was discovered effective in the prevention of Strep in Cows milk, back in the early 1900's, following ACV in cows diets, in Vermont, USA.######I 've heard good things about apple cider vinegar and use it myself as a part of a salad dressing. The point I want to make is the actual blood pressure readings. The drops recorded in these posts is not very spectacular and does not necessarily indicate success with this or that cure. Blood pressure readings are never very accurate and can only show a range. A BP monitor can change have a variation of as much as 10 points up or down even though the person's actual blood pressure has changed a bit. Of course if you consistently read over 145 systolic or over 105 diastolic then it 's time to pay attention and act.######Aliante did you know our bodliy fluids (blood & amnionics) are as salty as the ocean, in actual fact if we do n't have these natural salts in our system we run the risk of having strokes & causing brain damage. My reason for bringing this to your attension is this; most supermarket salt is extracted of all other minerals & treated at high heat temps which changes any minerals left to a different molecular structure in which we ca n't absorb cellularly so instead our body stores away anything it cant eliminate as fat. This is one reason where salt causes bp to rise among other things, the other reason is our body ca n't eliminate the salts if there is not enough fluids to pass through the cellular level so in fact salt will act as a cleanser & be eliminated from the body when we hydrate correctly with clean quality water. I have lost 49 lb of weight using salt & a alkalizing diet where i consumed high levels of calories of the correct nature & correct hydration & no exercise, my BP fell from 150/80 to currently 118/62 there is an exact proceedure for this & attempting this without propper guidance is not advised. Go study my posts & you will find more on this & other subjects that are here only to help people research there own nutrition######I do know the difference with supermarket salt and natural ones. I do use some salt on my food, but I buy the natural rock salt from France and grind it myself. Too much salt is bad for Blood Pressure, most anyone knows this. Since my first post in 2007, I have evolved to better things in my weight loss efforts and in lowering my blood pressure. I eat a whole food plant based diet. I still take the ACV once in awhile but I now take hawthorne berry supplements exclusively and I walk for at least 1 hour every evening. The walking alone will lower your blood pressure. The hawthorne keeps the circulation going. I have found now that i have to lower my hawthorne berries down to 1 supplement 3 times a day. Before it was 2 supplements 3 times a day. Since the weight has been dropping off, in the first month i lost 5 lbs a week, now I just lose 2 pounds a week. So no thanks, I will pass on the salt regimen. I found something that works much better for me and it 's easy, just lace up the walking shoes, grab a bottle of water, go outside, put one foot in front of the other, walk as fast as I comfortably can and walk as far as I can. Repeat daily.######Grocery store pharmacy automated blood pressure cuffs are supplied by pharmacuetical companies. They started showing up when the market was flooded with effective blood pressure medicines. I 've never found one that does n't read my BP about 10-20 points higher than a doctors office visit. You should allways have BP tested by a trained professional using calibrated equipment.######Aliante, YOUR MISSING THE POINT it 's not the salt causing high bp it 's the lack of water, my bp dropped & natural salt is alkalizing which is a protection factor against cancer. Too much exercise can cause weight gain if we do n't hydrate correctly.######How do you figure too much excercise can cause weight gain if we do n't hydrate correctly?

My regular doctor has tried various meds over the past 5 months and my pressure has continued to stay as high as ever.######Not sure. But I bet a cardiologist would know a LOT about BP.######Quest, maybe you have ``white coat '' hypertension. A lot of people get nervous going to the doctor, and that can cause a rise in bp. Some tips to get a more accurate reading: Avoid caffeine 2-3 hours before taking bp. Cut way way down on salt and processed foods. Since processed foods contain way too much salt, especially canned soups. Exercise regularly, at least 30 mins a day, preferably more. Try taking Apple cider vinegar (ACV) 2-3 times a day. The raw organic apple cider vinegar like Braggs, Spectrum or other brands. Not the type you cook with. The best meds to take if you really have to take them to lower bp is a diuretic alone. That usually does the trick and despite what a lot of doctors will tell you, you do not need another med with it. The other med causes way too many problems with the side effects, and you find you are always sleeping. I hate that side effect..######-Conditions and Diseases###-High Blood Pressure and Hypertension

Oatmeal is amazing for this from what I understand. . I have been doing a lot of research because I 'm worried about my kiddo... and there was a 12 week study of people who ate oatmeal every morning for breakfast and 73% supposedly no longer needed their bp meds. . which is amazing! Fish is also very good for you for many reasons, but is known to lower bp because of the omega 3 fats and anti-inflammatories naturally found inside of them. (FDA recommends 2 six ounce servings per week of cold water fish per week, and of course that you try to keep it organic if possible.) Broccoli and legumes are very good for your heart... oh and for snacks things like fresh berries, and pistachios are great. Docs recommend 1/3 cup pistachios per day. Good luck !!######Thanks for your answers, I have now lost 23 lbs. and lowered my bp. I sought the help of a hypnotist to release the wieght and it worked and is still working.

You are supposed to use the ORGANIC version only. Apparently, 2 tablespoons in a large glass of water twice daily, can throw in a tablespoon of honey for good measure (and better taste). By the way, it will do wonders for lowering your cholesterol, too, if there 's a problem.######Interesting, This is the same recipe that my grandparents over 50 years ago for stomach flu.

Just before lunch and dinner. Because of the benefits I have read about ACV and other things besides BP I take it at that time.######Hi, Im new to this post but, my husband grew up in the country and swers that acv can cure everything. i decided to try it for my blood pressure wish seems to fluctuate. It will be 119/80 in the day and around 5 pm after I have eaten dinner it will rise to 144/96 (it has been higher) I also have panic attacks also. I took the acv and it actually ran my blood pressure up. any suggestions?######I 'd wait a little bit longer before calling it quits. I started taking ACV about 2-3weeks ago and am seeing great results already! My BP readings are consistently low now- I should say normal, I guess- in the 120's and 75-80's. I can not believe it- the BP meds were not able to bring my BP to a decent level in 4 months- but a bit of ACV daily did. I can not think of any other reason for my BP being in the normal range. ACV was the only addition to my diet that I can think of. My suggestion: give it time to work!######I recommend all to try ACV. It is amazing stuff! I have hypertension for over 2years, been on Toprol and then Coreg but either could lower my blood pressure like ACV. My bp readings were in the 140/90s. I have been taking ACV for almost a week now, and my bp this morning was 120/90! I could n't believe it so I waited 10 min to take another reading. It was 116/88! I have n't made any changes in my diet except taking 2 teaspoons daily with Welch grape juice (once in the morning and then before dinner). Go give this a try!######I have been taking ACV for 2 weeks now, and can not get my BP below 130/80 (it went from 150s/90s and pretty much stays stuck at 130/80). So I am skeptical that ACV has more than a modest effect. alex######acp, If you can attribute this reduction in blood pressure (and it 's not a modest one, either !!!) to apple cider vinegar, I 'd say it 's a! Believe it or not, 20 points is a LOT! Just ask any of us with stage 2 or 3hypertension. There are very few natural substances that will effect high blood pressure so dramatically. Consider yourself lucky.######My problem is, I do n't know what is working, given that I take fish oil, coenzyme Q, magnesiusm, hawthorn, three amino acids (arginine, carnitine, taurine), vitamin C, AND do intensive cardio every day, AND eat (more or less) vegetarian + fish, AND do relaxation exercises, AND then the ACV! And still I can not get the BP below 130/80. Had one ``miracle reading '' of 126/80, but on average its stuck at 130/80. I know this is n't horrific, but still above the 120/80 (or 115/75 depending on your POV), so I 'm a little frustrated at this point.######acp, sounds like you 've been doing all the right things! I think your reduction in blood pressure is a result of a combination of things: exercise, diet, including apple cider vinegar, those great Omega 3 fatty acids, even your meditation (stress reduction). Keep up the good work and you 'll watch those numbers get consistently lower! Like myself, you 'll have to continue with your regimen because any changes could mean an increase in blood pressure. Getting the results we want takes time! Flowergirl######I 've done some reading about apple cider vinegar and the suggested benefit of lowered bp... I 've not found any documentation to support these claims. I did find some information that may be of interest... 1. ACV can destroy tooth enamel, so if you 're going to take it... drink it with a straw or rinse your mouth out afterwards. 2. ACV can result in decreased potassium levels... as this is a side effect of some of our bp meds, this could put some of us in double jeopardy-- a potassium deficiency can be dangerous-- we need a certain amount of potassium to regulate our heart rhythms, etc. 3. ACV can result in decreased bone mineral density. Bsheba######Beth, thanks for pointing that out !!! We should always consider both the potential benefits of a product and the pitfalls, especially where taking it might result in an interaction with bp medication. It is suggested that the vinegar be added to a large glass of water when taken (to protect the tooth enamel? easier digestion? less troublesome when encountering gastric acids?)######Hi, I love this website, just wanted to let anyone know who takes the ACV, that Organic unfiltered is the absolute best. It looks kind of cloudy but it has been unfiltered which means all the MOTHER as it is called has not been removed, this substance I like to call pulp myslef, is what has the curative ability. We us Bragg or Spectrum brands, i have high blood pressure now, and have already been using the vinegar for sinus infections, I ca n't wait to see how its works on my blood pressure.######I love the apple cider Vinegar, the Braggs or Spectrum brands are the best, they are Organic, unfiltered which means the cloudy looking sediment on the bottom is the part that has the healing ability. Organic vinegar is so good for sinus and UTI infections, I ca n't wait to see how it works on my blood pressure.######Easier to get past the nose? Yes, I suspect all of the above. I did hear on tv that the only (edible?) acid stronger than our stomach acid is lime juice. Bsheba######Hi, 130/80 is not bad...######Actually yesterday I hit 120/78... it has been trending 127/78 this past week. Unfortunately my doctor does n't think home readings count... he 'd rather go by the ones the nurse gives when I 'm stressed out through the roof, and not his OWN which typically read 130/80 or less with the mercury meter. Maybe if my home machine hits 100/60 he 'll be happy...######I previously posted that I was disappointed in ACV after getting my BP down to only mid 130s/low 80s, from 150s/90s. Well I stand chagrined: today's reading was 116/76, and the last 9 have been below 120/80. Diastolic has n't been above 80 in 2 weeks. I wish I know if ACV was the factor, but it sure as hell did n't hurt !!! acp######Congratulations! I am so happy for you! You MUST be doing something right. Do n't change a thing! (Including taking your acv). Flowergirl######Terrible relapse. After a B reading of 111/65 today I was overjoyed. But then for some reason I checked about 20 minutes later: 131/74. I then checked 30 minutes later: 143/77 !!! Now I am confused and depressed. What can cause this? Anxiety?######acp, Any number of things and activities can boost your BP. What did you do between readings? What did you eat and drink? We all take our health seriously. It 's only natural for us to worry. It 's a vicious circle, though. Obsessing about our health (or lack of) is going to increase our anxiety, which, in turn, will have a negative effect on our BP. With each setback it becomes more difficult to stay focused and remain enthusiastic. (speaking from personal experience here). It is up to us to take responsibility for our own health and try to stay of the situation. Sometimes it means going through a bunch of ups and downs. You may feel confused, but do n't allow yourself feel depressed! Remeber, it is positive attitude that enables you to work toward your goals! Flowergirl######How does the ACV lower blood pressure? Is it a diuretic effect? Just wondering? Also, does anyone get their ACV from Trader Joes? - that is the closest health food store near me. Leea######Am I to understand that if you take acv, you can come off your meds. ? That is if it works for you.I got some acv by Bragg it was 5.49 a quart which if it works is great!I am on two different meds. for hb.What dosage to y' all think I should start out with?I took one tbs. at lunch & supper.Thanks######Nobody really knows how it works, and indeed ACV has a LOT of detractors. Scientists who have analyzed it say the ``stuff '' like potassium in it is in far too minute quantities to affect blood pressure. BUT, another take is that ACV is like coffee, or wine. These drinks have HUNDREDS of substances in then, that may work synergistically, (both good and bad ways) on the body. I suspect that is the case with ACV: its the combination of stuff, no matter how minute for each one, that does the trick. I would NOT drop your meds BTW while taking ACV until the doctor gives you an all-clear!######Hi everyone... great forum! I would like to try ACV for bacterial infection, maybe candida, but I have low blood pressure. Will it lower it more ?? Its hard to find something to work besides antibiotics... hopefully someone could help... thanks######Question about apple cider vinegar. How can you take your BP Med's with this. Is it safe to take with all BP med's and if not- who do you ask if it is OK. My doctor would not know. I would love to try this but am scared to take it along with my med. Any suggestions? Thanks, Pat######Pat, Do you eat ketsup, Bar b que sauce, mustard. They all contain Apple cider and or other kinds of Vinegar. I really do n't thinks it 's an issue with BP meds, I take 4 different kinds and have seen no ill effects. Good Luck######Patti, You do not need to take it with your BP meds! You can add 1-2 tbsp of the ORGANIC type only (unfiltered) to a large glass of water, add some honey... presto! Delicious and refreshing drink! As far as I know it 's safe. It really works and is effective for a number of ailments. It helps lower cholesterol, helps reduce blood pressure and inflammation among other things. A lot of people swear by it. It has helped me. Flowergirl######Thanks I really want to try it but thought since it had alot of potassium in it it would go not go with my BPM. even if you did not take them together. I guess I will try 1tsp and see if it does anything to me... thanks again Pat######Yes I do eat small amounts of those items but have heard that potassium does not go well with all BPM.

I would ask your OBGYN or your baby's pediatrition before taking any diatary supplements. The liquid form might just make your milk taste sour to your baby, I would ask the doctor to make sure that it can not harm him/her.

Diabetes is a disease wherein the body fails to manufacture or properly use insulin.Insulin is an agent of the blood sugars that is used as a source of energy throughout the body.Although the liver uses insulin for the storage of glycogen, a processed form of glucose. In a person with Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin that is produced does not work properly, and the sugars are not able to get into some of the cells.######There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is sometimes called insulin-dependent, immune-mediated or juvenile-onset diabetes. It is caused by an auto-immune reaction where the bodyâ$ s defence system attacks the insulin-producing cells. The reason why this occurs is not fully understood. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually occurs in children or young adults. People with this form of diabetes need injections of insulin every day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood. If people with type 1 diabetes do not have access to insulin, they die. Type 2 diabetes is sometimes called non-insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes do not usually require injections of insulin. Usually, they can control the glucose in their blood by watching their diet, taking regular exercise, oral medication, and possibly insulin. Type 2 diabetes is most common in people older than 45 who are overweight. However, as a consequence of increased obesity among the young, it is becoming more common in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes. If people with type 2 diabetes are not diagnosed and treated, they can develop serious complications, which can result in an early death. Worldwide, many millions of people have type 2 diabetes without even knowing it. Others do not have access to adequate medical care. The onset of type 2 diabetes is also linked to genetic factors but obesity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet increase the risks. Some women develop a third, usually temporary, type of diabetes called â$ gestational diabetesâ$ when they are pregnant. Gestational diabetes develops in 2-5% of all pregnancies, but usually disappears when the pregnancy is over. Women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on. For more information please check http://www.fenfuro.com/about-diabetes.html######I am also suffering from Type 2 diabetes. It is really very hard to live with diabetes. Many times people are get depressed. But weight loss is one of the very good way to control diabetes..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

Just found out that my two sisters have diabetes, and hoping I do n't. Can someone tell me what your first symptoms were of diabetes. My sister said that she would get hot and sweaty and could n't lose weight.######Hot, sweaty, and not able to lose weight are not symptoms of diabetes. Weight loss, palore, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue are symptoms.######Okay thanks, I thought that not being able to lose weight was not one of the symptoms.######Lady50, I read in a Diabetes journal that there is a connection between Diabetes and NOT being able to lose weight. I know for myself, I tried different approaches to losing weight but did n't get results. Since recently being told I 'm Diabetic I started to watch my carb intake and carb mixtures for the past month to have control of my sugar numbers and already seen a reduction in my weight. It may be more of eating a healthier low carb diet but I also think since my sugar is at a steady pace- it 's easier for me to get the weight off. \* I also do get hot and sweaty but I 'm 46- that 's just plain ol' mother nature. PollyAnn######The not being able to lose weight may be what causes Type 2, but it is definitely not a symptom of diabetes. When you have diabetes, you are n't able to properly use carbohydrates for energy, so you urinate them out. This basically results in your peeing out your number 1 energy source, forcing your body to burn fat rapidly. Therefore, weight loss is a symptom.######Thats not exactly it but close. The Problem comes from No Insulin. Type 1 Diabetics will ofton see the weight loss but Type2's usually wont. When there is not any insulin in the body at all the body cant do many things, Insulin is responsible for Moving Glucos from the Blood stream to where it is needed. Which includes to Glycogen for energy and to fat for storage. Without any insulin the body also cant rebuild muscle as it gets broken up when used. So you end up losing tons of muscle. Unfortunately many Type 2 Diabetics actually do not experience any symptoms at all.######I visited a Diabetes Support group and the first thing I noticed was that everyone there was overweight. My thoughts were `is this the way I 'm heading with my Diabetes'. I have about 25lbs to lose but these people were a lot heavier. I went to gain knowledge from others that are in the same boat but at first I felt a little odd. Everyone was very nice, had different types of Diabetes and ranged in all ages. There was a 13-year-old girl who takes insulin and even she was overweight. Does insulin cause you to gain weight? I also learned from this group that most everyone has other serious issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure and lung problems. And the women in the late 40's age said they were dealing with Menopause symptoms and think possibly that Diabetes is making the symptoms worst for both their Diabetes and Menopause. It was n't the place for me but it 's nice that there are such place for support.######I agree type 2 diabetics do n't always show weight loss or any symptoms at all, but I do n't believe only people with type 1 experience weight loss. My pathophysiology text book lists weight loss as a symptoms for both types. Type 1s will lose more weight for the reasons you mentioned, but they will overall have more symptoms since their blood sugar will raise at a much more rapid pace. Once blood sugars reach over 180, most people will be peeing out glucose, since that is generally the renal threshold for glucose.######Thank you all so much. I have another question, hope ya all do n't mind. Right now I am like dead broke, and wanted to get a diabetes test since 2 sisters of mine have it. I was thinking of going to the local Health Department and get a finger \*\*\*\*\* blood sugar test. Do you think this test would detect diabetes in me. If your bloodsugar is quite high, does that mean diabetes. I have read that urinalysis is a good test, since there should be no sugar in the urine. This finger \*\*\*\*\* bloodtest will only cost me 3 bucks.######correction: should have said finger poke instead of the other word.LOLLOL######If both your sisters have it, I would think the easiest way to detect it would be asking one of them to test you. If it 's high, my suggestion to you is to get health insurance before you get diagnosed by a doctor.######It 's all very confusing to me. I thought Diabetes I was when your body ca n't produce insulin at ALL. that 's why it has to be injected. Type II diabetes is totally different and it 's not insulin that they 're taking by pill form. the medication they take by pill form helps regualte their blood sugar in type II. Insulin ca n't be produced in pill form. only with injection. type II can be cured by changing the diet. It 's proven. It 's very technical and can be down right confusing. hypoglycemia, vs reactive hypoglycemia is different from eachother too. I need a good book to describe and illistrate to me in detail what each one is. in laymans terms or dummy form like they make dummy books for computers. the longer I go with having low blood sugar attacks, the worst my being able to understand anything in an orderly fashion is diminishing. it 's very frustrating. maybe there 's a book out there in the market for me. anyone have any suggestions? Linda######There are several types of diabetes. type 1- the immune system attacks it 's own pancreas. This results in the insulin producing cells no longer being able to produce insulin. The blood glucose raises rapidly and dangerously. As no insulin is present, external insulin must be provided through injection or a pump. type 2- this is a bit more complicated. In type two, for some reason, the cells stop responding to the insulin being produced. Basically, insulin acts as the gatekeeper for the cells, allowing glucose to enter the body cells. Think of it as the gatekeeper falling asleep on the job. To make up for this, ``reinforcements '' are sent in. The body just keeps making more insulin so blood glucose can be maintained at a somewhat normal level, though the level does raise. Eventually, the body ca n't make any more insulin, so lack of insulin production becomes a sign of type 2 at some point in time. Gestational- basically in this one, the fetus takes all the glucose away from mom's body. So mom's body tries to not store glucose, but keep it all in the blood instead. The glucose raises. Also, some resistance is present due to the added weight. MODY- maturity onset diabetes of youth. This is a rare genetic form of diabetes. Basically, the body is born not being able to make enough insulin (but it makes some), and it gets worse with age. Diet and exercise can be used at first, then meds, then insulin. LADA- latent onset autoimmune diabetes of adults. Think of this as an adult getting Type 1. It 's a form of type 1 diabetes, but the onset is slower and at an older age.######update: My sister checked my bloodsugar with the finger poke bloodtester. Before I ate, it was 140, after eating it was 117. A few hours later, it dropped down to 57. This is when I was feeling a bit shakey inside.Then I was craving sweets like mad. This is weird that it dropped so low.######Sounds like reactive hypoglycemia.######Thank you for helping me with this. I will be looking that up..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Thanks######If your brother has Type 1 diabetes, the only treatment is to use insulin, either with syringes (shots) or through an insulin pump. There currently is no permanent cure except a pancreas transplant, and they usually do n't do those unless the kidneys are also failing. If your brother has Type 2 diabetes, then it would be treated initially with diet, exercise and possibly oral medication. If he 's overweight and loses most of the excess weight, he then might not need any medication at all. But if he IS Type 2, it 's important that he not delay in treating it, as the blood sugar must be stabilized as soon as possible while he is attempting to lose the excess weight. I 'm assuming that it 's more likely that he 's a Type 1. A regimen of a shot of long-acting insulin taken once a day, coupled with rapid-acting insulin taken before eating and geared to the amount of carbs he will be eating, is the best way to control Type 1.

Type I can occur in older people, although not as common. It states that when it is not a clear case, one way of telling would be to check for islet cell antibodies in the patient's blood., which is an indication of Type I. Howevr, up to 20% of Type I patients do not have these antibodies at time of diagnosis. To further complicate matters, people who will be likely to develop Type I diabetes often have these antibodies long before the disease becomes apparent! I also read that 80% of TYpe II's are obese (I think they use that term loosely) and that the remaining percent who are thin will often need insulin, even though they are type II. Apparently the oral meds work better on people who are overweight. Has anyone here had the experience of having a hard time being categorized? There was a young man on another forum who stated that he was on oral meds, even though he had antibodies in his blood, and the docs decided to leave him at that for awhile since it was working, even though the antibodies indicated he was Type I. Are there any Type II's reading this who need insulin, either alone or in addition to oral meds? Are you ``thin? '' Chris######Hi Chris, I have only had my dx's as a type 1 for 2 1/2 yrs. It was a smack in the face !! I went in for coughing and stuff. Dx 'd with double lung pneumonia, and diabetes. I also told the urgent care doc about the peeing and vision problem, and lack of energy, but I thought that was from the menopause (atleast that is what my gyn had told me) I recently went into due to hysterectomy. Within 30 days I saw an endocrinologist and she ran my HbA1c, it was 9.8 !!! She said I have diabetic for some time, maybe even years. This was odd to me, I was dx 'd 10/1/98, and I had my hysterectomy 7/17/98; do n't they run blood tests before surgery, I sure remember them taking alot of blood. Anyway, that scared me because they said I could 've died on the table, because nobody knew about the diabetes. I broke down when they were explaining this to me. This doctor was in the same building as my gyn and within a week my gyn sent me a letter stating he was dropping me from his care. He was terrified I was going to sue. I was just terrified he almost killed me !! Renee'######Hi Renee: Wow, that is awful. I would think that a fasting glucose would be part of the workup for surgery, along with other blood chemistries. I had a TAH in 1986, not sure if they drew blood for chemistries or not. I know they did a cell count (hemoblobin, hematocrit, white count etc) plus coagulations studies. They probably would also have done a type and screen in case of the need for transfusion. I 've had 2 laparoscopies in the past 3 years and no chemistries were done for them. I ca n't believe he would drop you from his practice. I would think that would make you even more inclined to sue. Chris######Dear Chris: In answer to your original question of any Type II's that need to take insulin, I am a Type II still under control with medication, however, I do a lot of heart disease support work and associate with heart surgeons, cardilogists and other medical professionals. Diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease. One of the reasons a Type II must go on insulin is that with Type II you have insulin resistance. In order for your body to combat the higher blood glucose levels, a message is sent to the islet (beta) cells of the pancreas that more and more of the natural insulin they produce is needed. These cells become overworked and could eventually ``burn out ''. If this happens, then a Type II must either combine insulin with medication or change over entirely to insulin in order to control blood sugars. Even though I am not on insulin, I have met Type II 's that had to go on insulin. If you can catch your diabetes early and have it under control, you stand a greater chance of not having to go on insulin if you are Type II. However, this is never any guarantee. Ken ------------------######hi Ken: Are these patients (type II's) more likely to be the ``thin '' type II's or is there no correlation between needing insulin either as a supplement or instead of oral hypoglycemic drugs and thinness? Chris######Dear Chris: About 90% of all diabetics are Type II. Weight does play a part in Type II diabetes, but Type II's seem to come in all sizes. If a Type II is overweight one of the first things that will be recommended by medical professionls is to get rid of the extra weight. This is usually done with a low fat diet coupled with a regular exercise program. Weight gain can also be associated with insulin dependent Type I diabetics. If an older Type I does not have an exercise program and then starts one, the dosage and type of insulin may have to be adjusted. In some Type I 's exercise may increase their blood glucose level, but for the most part, exercise is encouraged for all diabetics. I am Type II and have had a quadruple coronary bypass in 1992. My doctor tells me my current weight and body frame could n't be better, and my last HbA1C test came in at 6.1 which is a fantastic reading for a diabetic. Part of the ``fun '' for me in doing my heart patient support work is revealing to them my own medical history. Ken ------------------.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Please help!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes######For the past few months my hubby has not been himself. He is tired all the time, and since mid December has been constantly thirsty. He ca n't get enough to drink. Several trips throughout the day to the bathroom, (but would n't that be from all the liquids he drinks?) His vision goes blurry, he gets very shakey, and sometimes he says he feels like he is going to pass out. No energy. While shopping last night I picked up a blood glucose test meter. We waited until this morning to do the test. He did n't have anything to eat or drink for 9 hours so we could get the proper results. The meter came up with ``510 ''. The test said if it is below 20 or higher then 600 a warning would appear letting him know it was too low or too high. We do n't know what a normal level should be. The test does n't really tell us. We did the test again about an hour after he ate lunch and it was ``471 ''. I did the test also to see what would happen and mine said ``80 '' in the morning and ``105 '' after lunch. He is 54 years old and NEVER been to a family Dr. because of not having any health insurance.Today I called all over to find a Dr. that will accept new patients without insurance. After 3 hrs. I found one who made an appt. but not until March 25. I even explained how worried I am about him. No one seemed to care. If he would of had insurance, they would have glady seen him. Can someone please tell us what a normal reading should be and your opinions on his symptoms? Thank you!######I do n't mean to scare you. But I would STRONGLY suggest you take your husband to a hospital emmergency room IMMEDIATELY. A lot of his other blood chemistries could also be out of whack and life threatening. It is possible that he may just get sent home with a prescription for glyburide, but please, you are better safe than sorry. These numbers are life threatening from what I understand. Please do not wait for the dr's appt. Go to the hospital. His numbers are extremely high. Anything above 126 is abnormal and these are life threatening values, again, from what I understand.######Normal is more in the range you saw on yourself, a bit higher would also be normal. In terms of symptoms, frequent urination is a symptom. I am not a Dr but my understanding is that where your blood sugar is too high, your kidneys try to dump some of the sugar out through urine. So you pee a lot. This dehydrates you and you are thirsty. I do n't know if you measured properly but if so, 510 and 471 would be very high. Can you continue looking for another doctor sooner? Is there not another medical service you can get help with?######I agree with Uma... your husband should go to the nearest emergency room. With blood sugars running that high, he could be in diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. While there, ask if he would qualify for uncompensated care (most hospitals have a fund to help take care of people who do n't have health insurance and are in financial straits but still need urgent medical care.) A non-diabetic's blood sugars would never go that high, even after eating a high-carb meal. Normal range is between 70 and 140, never higher. Your husband is definitely diabetic... question is, whether it 's type 1 or type 2, and the only way to tell is through some blood tests. Ruth######Yes, that would indicate diabetes, probably type 2, given his age, meaning he has resistance to his own insulin. He needs to see a doctor or go to the hospital asap to get his blood glucose in control. Normal blood glucose is between 70 and 120, so 520 is very high. Meters read ``HI '' when over 600, but that warning is just indicating extremely severe highs. Good luck, and do not let this slide so as to prevent any complications.######Finally talked hubby into going to the ER instead of waiting for Dr. appt. He does have type 2 diabetes. He did n't have any ketones which they said was a good thing. His glucose level while we were there was 296. They gave him a prescription for Metaformin. They set him up with a follow-up Dr. for this Thursday. I just want to thank e `one for telling me he should go to the ER. I was really scared for him. He 's been on the med. for 2 days but his numbers are still in the 200's. Anyone have any idea how long this med. takes to start working? Thank you all again!######Everyone is different but met can take weeks to kick in full effect. If I remember well they said as much as 4 to 6 weeks. When I started it was n't doing anything and I read it COULD take several weeks. It will slowly start to make a difference. Was it his morning levels that were so bad or after eating? In the mean time, go easy on the carbs and drink lots of water.######Not really sure if he is overweight, but probably is. . He is 6 ' 1 '' and weighs 255 pounds He 's gained 25 pounds since Sept' 07. Thats when he quit smoking (cold turkey) and took up eating candy. . tons of it! Around Nov./ Dec. is when he started feeling really bad. . (But since not feeling well he 's been losing weight) The ER did n't give us a diet plan or anything to follow before his Dr. appt. on Thursday, so I had to go online and look it up. I know the med. is making him even more sicker to his stomach, cramps, and diarrhea. I guess thats a normal side effect from what I have read about it and just to stick with it because you will feel worse before you get better ??? His reading this morning before breakfast was 189, the lowest it 's been since we started monitoring it a few days ago. Exercise. . yes, my hubby wants the both of us to start going for walks. We will ask the Dr. about it first. He 's a bricklayer and ca n't wait for spring to settle in so he can return to work. But mostly, all he keeps saying is. . ``I hope I get better ''. He 's very worried about not having insurance and not being able to work if he does n't get feeling better. Hopefully things will work out somehow.######If he is in fact Type2, the metformin will start having an effect after about 3 weeks. But if he is Type1, metformin wo n't do him any good and he will steadily get worse. The fact that the onset has been so quick, blood sugars of 500 + have been recorded, and he has lost weight suggest that it could be Type1. So watch it carefully.######He was diagnosed with type 2.######Sheila, From what I have heard and read, the side effects from metformin do go away after a while, but if they become intolerable, the best way to manage is to start from the beginning, with a very small dose, and then increase it gradually over a period of several weeks. Do n't know how much he 's taking, so ca n't tell if he 's on a large dose already or not. This is something you can work out with his doctor. Ruth######Thank you Ruth. He is on 500mg, 3 times a day.######There are people who 's pancreas produces no insulin. They are type 1. There are people who produce insulin but their body does n't use it well. They are type 2. And there are people in between who do n't produce quite enough or who 's body barely make due with what they produce. There are people borderline between the two. The progression of one to another sometimes occurs with age Doctors will try and use metformin and if your husband does n't get good control, they will try other medications and may eventually prescribe the use of insulin. Metformin is usually the first attempt. If it does n't work, there are several other weapons in the arsenal. I guess theoretically the minute you use insulin you are type 1. NIDDM is ``non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus '' (type2). IDDM is ``insulin depenant diabetes mellitus '' (type 1). I does n't really matter if he is type 1 or 2. The important thing is for him to get control, and if to do so, means insulin injections, so be it. They are not the end of the world, just think of them as a different form of medication. But for now, listen to the Dr. Metformin does a couple of things. I allows the insulin your husband has (assuming he is producing some) more efficiently. It also reduces the amount of sugar his liver produces. If he is responding to metformin, the chances are he does have some insulin production left. If it 's enough is to be determined. But remember, if not, insulin injections are not the end of the world. I hope this info helps. If it 's just annoying, let me know######I feel the need to correct a misconception here. Type1 Diabetes and Type2 Diabetes are clinically diseases and need to be treated in different ways. Type1 is an autoimmune disorder, whereas Type2 is the result of insulin resistance. While you ca n't progress from the one to the other, it is possible to have both Type1 and Type2 at the same time. The problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between them in the early stages, and Type 1 is often mis-diagnosed as Type 2. If the diagnosis was not based on insulin level and antibody test results, it could be wrong. As I mentioned in the previous post, normal weight, weight loss and very high blood glucose readings suggest that this could be the case. The fact there were no ketones could just mean that the pancreas is still producing enough insulin to stop this from happening. But things change fast in the onset of T1. And treating Type1 with type2 oral medications accelerates onset of the disease. Most importantly, these medications wo n't stop the development of ketoacidosis, which is dangerous condition. This is why it needs to be watched carefully at this stage.######Could n't have said it better myself, Mark! Also, even if T2 progresses to the point where one is insulin-dependent (as I am), it is STILL T2, not T1. It 's just T2 with a completely worn-out pancreas. Ruth######Unfortunately not all doctors and litterature use the terms the way you do. Some refer to type 1 as insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 as non insulin dependent (NIDDM). They seem to classify the result, i.e ``do I need insulin ''. You have classified them, as some doctors and litterature by the underlying issue, ie deterioration of the beta cells in the pancreas vs deterioration of the bodies ability to use insulin, that may lean to a burn out of insulin production. In your language, is IDDM type 1 and NIDDM type 2 or are those terms meaningless?######No, Type1 is not equal to IDDM and Type2 is not equal to NIDDM. And yes, it is unfortunate that the terminology has become so confusing. I think it highlights the shortcomings of defining a disease by its symptomatic characteristics. It makes much more sense to define a disease in terms of what causes it. But up until the 1970's, the distinction between the respective causes of what we now know as Type1 and Type2 diabetes were not well understood. So it was easier to call them IDDM and NIDDM. The terms Juvenile Onset Diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes were used for similar reasons. Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years. It is not uncommon for young people to become insulin resistant and for older people to have an autoimmune attack on their beta cells. It is also common for someone with insulin resistance to lose all beta cell function and become totally dependent on injected insulin (like Ruth). Also consider that an insulin dependent T2 is not the same as a T1 (who is also insulin dependent). The presence of insulin resistance means that additional treatment options may have to be considered. The net effect is that those old terms have lost their descriptive exclusivity. This is why usage of the IDDM/NIDDM and Juvenile/Maturity Onset Diabetes terminology has been superseded by ``Type1 '' and ``Type2 '' diabetes. These terms are both well understood in terms of the respective etiology, and the risk of mis-diagnosis has been brought into focus. This is what I was commenting on in the earlier post. It is easy to misdiagnose a T1 as T2 in the early stages. Doctors still use age and size as diagnostic guidelines and do n't do the required tests. Use of the old terms, IMO, is not helpful and just causes a lot of confusion. Mark######To highlight the lack of clarity, this from the definition page of the canadian diabetes association. (url) http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/dictionary.asp[/url] TYPE 1 DIABETES (or insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas no longer produces any or very little insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar as an energy source. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and affects 10% of people with diabetes. TYPE 2 DIABETES (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs or the insulin is not metabolized effectively. Type 2 usually occurs later in life and affects 90% of people with diabetes..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I went to the diabetes center yesterday to get a monitor and have them show me how to use it. I 'm supposed to check my blood sugar levels 4 times a day: before breakfast and 2 hours after each meal. When I went in, it was three hours after I had eaten, but we took it anyway and recorded it like it had been 2. It was 109. Now, the guidelines she gave me says I do n't want it to be above 120 at the 2-hours-after mark. So 109 is pretty significantly lower (i think), but I did n't think much about it because it had been an extra hour. I took it again two hours after dinner, and it was 92. This morning it was 70. I do n't know what the morning number is supposed to be, but that still seems low to me. My fasting number, which is pretty much the same thing, when I took the glucose test was 96, and the nurse commented on how ``great '' that was because it was so low. But 70? Maybe I do n't know anything, but those numbers seem really low to me. I do n't want to call and be freaking out or anything until I have a full day of testing under my belt, but I was wondering if anybody here knew anything about it. How low is too low? Should I be concerned?######I just took my three hour long glucose test yesterday and im worried that it will come back bad. Pretty sure it will. I dont know if I can freaking prick my fingers like that... Ahhhh makes me queasy thinking about it. The dr said it can get so worse as to inject insulin too ??? I hope you find out your answers = 0 \############I dont know a week ago I took the hour long test, they took my blood I drank the nasty sprite stuff. . Waited an hour and they took my blood the test came back bad so I had to do the same thing but for three hours and they took my blood 4 times, once before and once every hour into the test up till the fourth hour. They didnt do that with you?######Yes, they did. But what i 'm saying is that when they prick your finger, they know within seconds what your sugar levels are. They should n't be making you wait to get the results; they knew the results when you were sitting right there. It 's not like they have to send bloodwork to a lab or something. Heck, I knew before the last prick on my three-hour test that I had failed it because I was already high on two of the numbers.######Oh I havent pricked my finger yet I just took the four hour test yesterday and they said if any two of them come back high I have gestational diabities which im pretty sure they will. I used to have highinsulin a few years ago when I was overweight so thats why the dr wanted to do this test early. Also every single time I eat I get tired and when I stand everything goes black. Something tells me its all connected. I should find out in a few days how the test came out and when I do she said that I have to come in and learn about all that pricking and stuff, see a dietition and some kind of group thing.######Yes, they have pricked your finger. If you did the glucose tolerance test, that 's what they do... Besides, you said they pricked your finger. Each time they prick your finger during that test, they are checking to see if your blood sugar levels are within a certain range. If it 's too high, then that 's bad. They would have known when they did the test if your levels were too high, there is nothing to ``wait '' on. Anyway... Someone * please * answer my question ?????######They took a tube of blood each time from my arm, the never pricked my finder. Hope you get your answer######That 's weird. Anyway, good luck to you. I 'm sure everything will be ok either way.######When I had my 1hr they pricked my finger... But when I had my three hour they drew 4 tubes of blood. I still go my results the next day. Didnt' need to worry abut it. When I had fainting spells they checked my blood and told me that I needed to make sure I ate something like an apple and drink a clear soda... It always made me feel better right away. They gave me the moniter too and as long as it was above 60 I was ok. But now I don; t have the spells anymore and I do n't have to prick my finger anymore.############My grandmother is diabetic and its disgusting now I know pregnancy induced diabetes is different and does go away 95% if you take care of urself this is what I do know some of it is from hubby... Carbs are really bad (basically they are spoons of sugar but come out later) taters, anything bread, carrots pretzels, chip etc naturals sugars you eat in halves so have half an apple in the morning the other in the afternoon just as an example. Make sure ur meals are complete 1/4 of ur plate should have stuff from every food group besides that ur about average for blood sugar 109 is quite high and 70 is kinda playing it on the average-normal side. Best of luck lalee just as an fyi for anyone if you have gestational diabete and do not take care of urself/eat healthy/moderation/diet it is very possible your diabetes may carry over past the pregnancy so take care of urself now! Hubby said its really gross when people come in with diabetes, it slowly kills you and your skin dies he said the smell can be somewhat bad now majority of people who have it did do it to theselves for not taking care of themseles unfortunatly there is people who never asked for it!############I had to sign up in order to respond to this post. I am a certified diabetes educator. The information that diamondsz provided is not only dangerous, but can be construed as prejudice advice to all with diabetes. Everything that diamondz said is wrong. 1) having diabetes is ``not disgusting. '' people who think it is do not even know what diabetes means. 2) gestational diabetes usually goes away, but a person with gestational diabetes is at risk for developing it again in future pregnancies, or type 1 diabetes (we 'll get to that). 3) carbs are not bad at all. Everything you eat consists of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You can not avoid carbohydrates, and in fact, probably consume 60% of them. There are many, many kinds of carbohydrates. I would get into that, but it would take weeks of writing to tell you about it. 4) spoon fulls of sugar is bad, like she said, but it is bad for everyone. Being diabetic does n't mean it 's bad. If you ever, ever say, ``oh my god, that person is diabetic, they ca n't be eating that (insert desert item here)! '' , you need to stick your foot in your mouth. Especially if you ca n't even tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All of the ``meal plan '' advice that has been provided by diamondz are just platitudes. It is impossible to do an armchair diagnosis of a person. Use this boards as support, not as medical advice. The fyi by diamondz is even more misleading. She claims that if you do n't take care of yourself now, then you 'll have diabetes later in life. This is not true. (we 'll get to that, too.) her ``hubby '' is wrong about diabetes, and it 's shameful that he be claimed to be an authority in this field. It 's all wrong, wrong, and wrong. Yes, uncontrolled diabetes leads to complications. Please note... Uncontrolled. This means different things to different types of diabetes. I wish diamondz did n't spread the common ``media belief '' of diabetes on this board. The following information is true: there are two major classifications of diabetes; type 1, and type 2. Of all the cases of diabetes in the world, between 5-10% of people in the world have type 1 diabetes; the remainder have type 2 diabetes. Of all the people who have type 2 in the world, there are over 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes. Four of the 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes are caused by lack of exercise, poor diet, and insulin resistance. This can sometimes be blamed on the person for not exercising or eating poorly-- in fact, most of the time, it is based on food. But some forms of type 2 diabetes are not the fault of the person. Hence, diamondz calling it ``gross '' is totally abusive in her ``authority. '' some people who have type 2 have gotten it because of cancer drugs (chemotherapy). So the next time you call a type 2 diabetic ``gross '', you 'd better have your facts straight-- they could be a five-time cancer survivor, and you 've just hurt their feelings for living. Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by diet, exercise, and sometimes oral medications called insulin sensitizers or incretin mimetics. Now, to the important type of diabetes-- type 1. Type 1 diabetes does not occur based on anyone's choice. It hits randomly. I said randomly. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction. Do you know anyone with ms? Lupus? Celiac disease? These are all autoimmune conditions. Type 1 diabetes can hit anyone-- at any time. It 's commonly called ``juvenile diabetes '' because it frequently occurs in younger people, but it can happen at any age. For every one-hundred diabetics that reads this message, five to ten of them have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 means their pancreas does not produce insulin, so it must be supplied through an insulin injection. So long as the person tests their blood glucose frequently, and adjusts for carbohydrate/fat/protein intake at meals, they can ``think like a pancreas '' and keep glucose values in normal ranges. This is not an easy job-- it is a full time job. This is a very complex subject, so i 've only touched the surface. There are basal insulins, bolus insulins, and a very complex world of diabetes management. If a person does not manage their blood glucose levels, they are more prone to diseases that affect small blood vessels (like retinopathy, kidney problems, neuropathy, and the list goes on). Please-- do not look at kids with type 1 and say they 're doomed. If they are in control of their diabetes, they live just as long. And with modern technology (e.G. Home blood glucose testing), complications of diabetes are reduced. Type 2 diabetes complications are of the same manner. These are the target populations that give type 1 diabetes a bad, bad name-- diamondz comments are evidence of this. I will respond to lalee's question in the following message.######Lalee, now to answer your question. Gestational diabetes is an interesting topic to me. It 's believed that in some women, insulin resistance causes the diabetic symptoms (it can be seen like type 2 diabetes), where in other cases, it models type 1 diabetes (where the mother's beta cells stop producing insulin in sufficient quantities). Home blood glucose meter kits have a +/ -20% error. This means that if you see 100mg/dl on the screen, it could be anywhere between 80 and 120 mg/dl. The purpose of the meter is tell a story of your trends. If you were showing 200 mg/dl on many occassions, this trend would be a flag about a problem. Showing 121 mg/dl does not mean you have diabetes... Even showing 140 mg/dl does not prove anything, because of the margin of error on the test kits. This fact should help to relax you a bit. Each of those tests costs$ 1.00, so it 's hard to experiment with the meter without costing a fortune. The average blood glucose level of humans, according to quest diagnostics statistics, is 85 mg/dl. This is a plasma level. This means that including post-meal, pre-meal, and fasting conditions, a person without diabetes averages, in their lifetime, 85 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose levels fall below 60 mg/dl. Some people may experience it, and simply eating a meal (or candy) can raise blood glucose back up. You might feel shakey, confused, tired, annoyed, scared, and even sweaty during hypoglycemia. This is because stress hormones turn on in the body in an attempt to raise blood glucose-- this hormone is called glucagon. When a type 1 diabetic takes too much insulin, or does too much exercise, their blood glucose can drop-- hence their need to chomp on fast acting carbohydrates (such as dextrose). Hyperglycemia is defined as the condtion when glucose is higher than 180 mg/dl. If you give even the healthiest person in the world a bunch of candy, they will rise above 120 mg/dl. The person training you probably was reading the brochure and standard training literature. And they probably do n't know that a meter has a +/ -20% error rate. (i actually see the one-touch ultra, and if you read the small print documentation, you 'll see this is the fact). Make sure your meter code is set for the test strips you 're using-- this can skew your results a bit when it does n't match the test strip vial. 70 mg/dl is normal for waking up. The values you have presented show no signs of hyperglycemia (diabetes). If you are ever worried about having low blood glucose, just eat. Typically, you will find yourself at a low glucose level in the mornings, since you have n't eaten much. If you get up and wait 30 minutes before testing, you 'll discover that your body (specifically, your liver) releases glucose to raise you in order to help you ``hunt for food. '' you have nothing to be concerned about. I 'm going to give one more lesson for any other readers out there. Why are we concerned with gestational diabetes? Well, here's why. Insulin is a hormone that turns glucose (sugar) into fat. That 's it. Yes, very simple. People who lack insulin can not turn glucose into fat, so their bodies ``starve to death ''-- people with type 1 diabetes before 1921 (the invention year of insulin) would die, despite whatever they ate. Type 2 diabetes is defined as insulin resistance-- meaing that their body has plenty of insulin, but for some reason, is not able to use it (i could speak for hours on this topic.) you have beta cells in your pancreas that release insulin in response to high glucose values. (this is why a type 1 takes insulin when they eat, or when they need to lower their hyperglycemia into normal glycemia, which is in the range of 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl). I 'm leaving out a lot of details here... But basically, here 's the problem. If your blood glucose goes really high, the baby will produce insulin in order to lower the blood glucose in its body. You see, you share what is in your body with the baby's body. If your blood glucose is high, the baby's blood glucose will be high, too. So what does the baby do? The baby's pancreas produces insulin to compensate. This insulin, though, does not travel out to the mother's body. Instead, it works to lower glucose in the baby. Read back to what I said that insulin does. It builds fat. Here's why gestational diabetes is a bad thing: 1) the baby will come out weighing 10 + pounds... Not exactly a thing you want going through you, right? 2) high blood glucose increases the chance of bacteria to set up shop, because glucose is the essential food for all life, including bacteria; 3) having high glucose in the mom can cause oxidative stress, meaning, the mom will feel yucky; 4) having high glucose in mom can result in mom's beta cells working too hard-- if they work too hard, they will become damaged, and the mom could potentially be left with type 1 diabetes, which can occur anywhere from one day after birth to... You guessted it... A risk lasting the rest of her life. Some women have 3 kids, and end up with type 1 diabetes. Sorry for all the lessons, but I really saw a lot of information that was way out of line in this thread. Diabetes should not and does not have a negative image associated with it, as diamondz was presenting. You should never define a person with diabetes as beign a ``diabetic '' in a social situation; would you call a person with cancer something like a ``that peson with cancer '' or a person confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis (ms) a ``multiple schleratic ''? I do n't think so. If you or anyone else has questions about diabetes, please feel free to contact me. Typos are the mistake of me writing this at 2 am. I hope this helps to lower your concerns. Also, I could go into the whole world of the glucose tollerance tests (gtt) that some of you have experienced, but I think this is more than enough information to digest for now. Btw, there are people who have ``hypoglycemia ''-- where they produce too much insulin, or become hypoglycemia after eating a high carbohydrate meal. (their body responds with insulin for the meal, but the insulin hangs around too long, causing cells to turn too much of that glucose into fat). Did you know that an average person has 6 grams of glucose in their blood? That 's why diabetes is so hard to manage... If you just add one extra gram of sugar in the body, it can raise glucose values by 40 mg/dl or even more (depending on weight). Okay, i 've said enough on this. I really hope diamondz takes back what she 's said about diabetes, and that she needs to have her husband, if he 's in the medical establishment, to stop telling her what he 's ``heard. '' by the way, a person's glucose can change by 300 mg/dlin as little as one hour. So do n't sweat the small changes. If you 're between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl while fasting, you 're doing great. Two hour post-meal (also called post-prandial) should be under 120 mg/dl, though some scientists believe 140 mg/dl is just as fine, so long as fasting levels return to below 100 mg/dl. These values are played with all the time, but since your home test kit is only correct within 40% of the actual value (+20% to -20%), you ca n't freak out. Now if you keep getting results that are high, or after eating, then you can be concerned a bit more. If you have more diabetes questions, I highly recommend going to the american diabetes association website (www.Diabetes.Org) and go to the message board, and post questions in the appropriate forum. You will have very well grounded and experienced people there that can assist you with your questions.######Weird, my capitalizations on certain words has been modified... For example, quest diagnostics is the name of a business, and should be with a capital ``q '' and a capital ``d '', but when I saved the message, it was placed in lower-case format. Needless to say, the above messages I posted are not how I wrote them. This forum must modify cases to their own non-english standard. -- oh, and one more thing... Labs do n't necessarily test with a glucose meter. For the person who had blood drawn into a tube at each hour, this is because they are sending the blood in for accurate tests. Their glucose meters are the same as the ones you can buy off the shelf. That means they still have that +/ -20% error. The blood they put in a tube, however, will be sent to a lab, spun on a centrafuge, and testsed. The margin of error for lab-tested blood is typically less than 2% (that means a 4 mg/dl error range), which is much, much, much, much more accurate than a home glucose meter.######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With Type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes may include fatigue, thirst, weight loss, blurred vision and frequent urination. Some people have no symptoms. A blood test can show if you have diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.######Great!

357	58	5c623249c061d6b8ea5adb15	http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic84.html	1	Diabetes Overview.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes######What Is Diabetes? Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Points to Remember What is diabetes? a disorder of metabolism-- the way the body digests food for energy and growth What are the main types of diabetes? type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes gestational diabetes What is the impact of diabetes? affects 17 million people is a leading cause of death and disability costs$ 132 billion per year Who gets diabetes? people of any age people with a family history of diabetes most common in older people, overweight and sedentary people, African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Where Is More Information Available?

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. How Is Diabetes Managed?

I guess my A1c test was high. Does this mean that I have diabetes? Thanks! She said my thyroid test was also high, are they connected in any way?######No, the diabetes is the liver connection. Thyroid is located elsewhere and not related. Best to get with the doctor and get information from the tests and what it all actually means. Good luck.######This is a copy and paste from journal.diabetes.org:######Hi there, Rainbowdawn, At a basic level, they are connected in that are both endocrine disorders, with diabetes being the most common. A high A1C probably means you 've encroached into the world of diabetes on some level but the key is understanding where you are at. Diabetes treatments run the gammut from making better lifestyle choices to having to supply your body with insulin. Try not to be nervous as 97% fall into the lifestyle category. Taking many things into account, your doctor is the best person to explain the best course of action to get you back on track. Elevated thyroid levels could signal something going on and, like diabetes, types & treatments run the gammut with many being extremely common. But again, your doctor is the best person to put things into perspective. I 've been hypothyroid for 20 years and diagnosed Type1 diabetic this Jan05. and I 'm 37 y/o. I 'm not sure exactly how they are connected scientifically (other than metabolically/cellularly) but my Endocrinologist is the one who determines my medication levels for both thyroid meds and insulin levels. Until I went Type1 (requiring the need of a specialist), I was always treated by my family doctor who followed practiced guidelines. Some background on thyroid & diabetes: Diabetes is correctly divided into two major subgroups: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. This division is based upon whether the blood sugar problem is caused by insulin deficiency (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2). Insulin deficiency means there is not enough insulin being made by the pancreas due to a malfunction of their insulin producing cells. Insulin resistance occurs when there is plenty of insulin made by the pancreas (it is functioning normally and making plenty of insulin) but the cells of the body are resistant to it 's action which results in the blood sugar being too high. The sole function of the thyroid is to make thyroid hormone. This hormone has an effect on nearly all tissues of the body where it increases cellular activity. The function of the thyroid therefore is to regulate the body's metabolism. So, take heart in that, while you may be having to look at some lifestyle changes, all will be well. Hope this helps some.

Sometimes a headache and nausea along with it. Throughout the day I 'm really weak and its gotten worse since it started a few months ago. I 'm barely able to walk now and I get really really hot and then really cold for a long time and then back to a few minute period of really hot. I 'll sometimes lose vision and go blind for a few seconds. Sometimes I 'll be fine afterwards and other times I pass out. I 'm 17 so I know I 'm not menopausal yet. These episodes come in waves usually when i get up from lying down or sitting, but they come even while sitting or not doing anything too. Does anyone else get this or have any answers ???######Luna13, It sounds like you may have orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension-- also called postural hypotension-- is a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down. The most common symptom of orthostatic hypotension is feeling lightheaded or dizzy when you stand up after sitting or lying down for a while. This feeling, and other symptoms, usually happens shortly after standing up and generally only lasts for a few moments. Orthostatic hypotension symptoms include: * Feeling lightheaded or dizzy after standing up * Blurry vision * Weakness * Fainting (syncope) * Confusion * Nausea Occasional dizziness or lightheadedness may be relatively minor-- the result of mild dehydration, low blood sugar, or too much time in the sun or a hot tub, for example. Dizziness or lightheadedness may also happen when you stand after sitting for a long time, such as in a lecture, concert, or church. If these symptoms happen only occasionally, it 's usually not cause for concern. When you stand up, gravity causes blood to pool in your legs. This decreases blood pressure because there 's less blood circulating back to your heart to pump. Normally, special cells (baroreceptors) near your heart and neck arteries sense this lower blood pressure and counteract it by triggering your heart to beat faster and pump more blood, which stabilizes blood pressure. This is probably why your heart rate seems to be racing. In addition, these cells cause blood vessels to narrow, which increases resistance to blood flow and increases blood pressure. This can sometimes cause changes in the blood flow to the skin, thus making the patient feel hot or cold. Orthostatic or postural hypotension occurs when something interrupts the body's natural process of counteracting low blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by many different things, including: * Dehydration. Fever, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, severe diarrhea and strenuous exercise with excessive sweating can all lead to dehydration. When you become dehydrated, your body loses blood volume. Even mild dehydration can cause symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, such as weakness, dizziness and fatigue. * Heart problems. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack, and heart failure. These conditions may cause orthostatic hypotension because they prevent your body from being able to respond rapidly enough to pump more blood when needed, such as when standing up. * Diabetes. Untreated diabetes can cause dehydration by causing frequent urination. This can trigger orthostatic hypotension. In addition, diabetes can damage the nerves that help send signals regulating blood pressure. * Nervous system disorders. Some diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy (Shy-Drager peripheral neuropathies), and amyloidosis, can disrupt your body's normal blood pressure regulation system. Some risk factors for orthostatic hypotension include: * Age. Orthostatic hypotension is common in those age 65 and older. As the body ages, the ability of special cells (baroreceptors) near the heart and neck arteries to regulate blood pressure can be slowed. Also, with age, it may be harder for the heart to beat faster and compensate for drops in blood pressure. * Medications. People who take certain medications, such as high blood pressure medication, have a greater risk of orthostatic hypotension. These include water pills (diuretics) and other drugs that treat high blood pressure; heart medications, such as beta blockers; drugs for Parkinson's disease or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); antidepressants; narcotics; and alcohol. Using drugs that treat high blood pressure in combination with other prescription and over-the-counter medications may cause low blood pressure. * Certain diseases. Parkinson's disease and some heart conditions put you at a greater risk of developing low blood pressure. * Heat exposure. Being in a hot environment can cause you to sweat and, possibly, cause dehydration, which can lower your blood pressure and trigger orthostatic hypotension. * Bed rest. If you have to stay in bed a long time because of an illness, you may become weak. When you try to stand up, you may experience orthostatic hypotension. Once you 're feeling better and regain your muscle strength, the orthostatic hypotension will likely improve. * Pregnancy. Because a woman's circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy, blood pressure is likely to drop. This could cause blood pressure to drop enough to cause orthostatic hypotension when standing up quickly. In addition, as the uterus expands, it can press on the large veins in the pelvis, reducing blood flow. Though most episodes of orthostatic hypotension are of short duration and mild, you may want to see your physician, since you are experiencing frequent symptoms and they are lasting longer than would be expected. This is because they can sometimes point to more-serious underlying problems. Make sure that you are not dehydrated and are eating a proper diet. You should maintain an exercise program, but do n't overdo it. If these episodes occur at times that may endanger you or others, take precautions. You may want to sit on the edge of the bed for a few moments, before standing, when you first get up in the morning (or after a nap). It may be helpful to keep a record of your symptoms, when they occur, how long they lasted, and what you were doing at the time. Take this with you, when you see the physician. Of course, there could be some other reason for your symptoms. But, it really does sound like you have at least some orthostatic hypotension when you stand up. You just need to find out why it is lasting so long. Good luck. Wishing you the best.######Thanks Gaelic ^_^.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Nausea

Can somebody please help me out for this?######bestsellingincense, The sudden drops in blood pressure that can be lifethreatening are those associated with collapse of the cardiovascular system, caused by such things as:- Loss of blood from severe bleeding, either internally or externally- Extremely low body temperature- Extremely high body temperature- Heart muscle disease causing heart failure- Sepsis, a severe blood infection, sometimes called blood poisoning- Severe dehydration from vomiting, diarrhea, or fever- A reaction to medication or alcohol- A severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis Chronic low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious. But health problems can occur when blood pressure drops suddenly, and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply. This can lead to dizziness or lightheadedness. Sudden drops in blood pressure most commonly occur in someone who 's rising from a prone or sitting position to standing. This kind of low blood pressure is known as postural hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, or neurally mediated orthostatic hypotension. Postural hypotension is considered a failure of the autonomic nervous system-- the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary vital actions, such as the heartbeat-- to react appropriately to sudden changes. Normally, when you stand up, some blood pools in your lower extremities. Uncorrected, this would cause your blood pressure to fall. But your body normally compensates by sending messages to your heart to beat faster and to your blood vessels to constrict. This offsets the drop in blood pressure. If this does not happen, or happens too slowly, postural hypotension results. The cause of low blood pressure is n't always clear, but it may be associated with the following:- Pregnancy- Hormonal problems such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes, or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)- Over-the-counter medications- Overdose of high blood pressure drugs- Heart failure- Heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)- Widening, or dilation, of the blood vessels- Heat exhaustion or heat stroke- Liver disease Postural hypotension, which is low blood pressure when standing up suddenly, can happen to anyone for a variety of reasons, such as dehydration, lack of food, prolonged standing in the heat, or being overly fatigued. It can also be influenced by genetic make-up, aging, medication, dietary and psychological factors, and acute triggers, such as infection and allergy. Postural hypotension occurs most frequently in people who are taking drugs to control high blood pressure (hypertension). It can also be related to pregnancy, strong emotions, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or diabetes. The elderly are particularly affected, especially those who have high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Hypotension after meals is a common cause of dizziness and falls after eating. It 's believed to be caused by blood pooling into he vessels of the stomach and intestines. Several drugs are commonly associated with postural hypotension. These medications can be divided into two major categories:- Drugs used to treat high blood pressure, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. - Drugs that have hypotension as a side effect, including nitrates, drugs for Parkinson's disease, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, anti-anxiety agents, sedative-hypnotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. Common causes of naturally occurring postural hypotension include:- Dehydration and electrolyte loss, which may result from diarrhea, vomiting, excessive blood loss during menstruation, or other conditions- Age associated decline in blood pressure regulation, which may be worsened by certain health conditions or medications Certain diseases can cause postural hypotension. These include:- Central nervous system disorders, such as Shy-Drager syndrome or multiple system atrophy- Nerve problems, such as peripheral neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy- Cardiovascular disorders- Alcoholism- Nutritional diseases######Hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, dehydration causes the blood pressure, nutritional diseases is also the reasons to blood pressure..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Low Blood Pressure and Hypotension

My problem seems related, as I seem to have both high and now low blood pressure. Re: the low, I play a lot of pickleball... three or four hours a day, or I used to, anyway. Now, if I play outdoors especially, I can feel my blood pressure start to drop. I get dizzy, ca n't focus on the ball, and get very fatigued and weak. If I take my blood pressure, which is often quite high (normal in 140 + over 90 +, can go much higher and I am on one blood pressure med for hypertension) will dump to 70/50.

My weight is normal, age 65.######Hello, sounds awful...! I have something similar and have been diagnosed with Pure Autonomic Failure, (PAF) which is a problem with the automatic peripheral nervous system. This failure affects blood pressure regulation which does the opposite of what it should do- drops when standing, exercising, climbing stairs and goes very high at night when lying down. It also affects the sweating response- in me this has stopped altogether so is dangerous in hot weather. As well, PAF can affect digestion, bladder and bowel function causing nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, uninary problems, etc.. There is some research into the cause being an antibody response attacking the nervous system, but this is n't the cause for everyone with PAF. I do n't know where you live but insist on seeing a neurologist who specialises in conditions of the autonomic system. In UK, the main place is the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. in US, I think it is Vanderbilt University.

The hypotension may be primary, or it may be secondary to a condition such as tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia. Vasovagal syncope describes this condition, as well as other conditions that are considered to be dysautonomic responses to upright posture, such as orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). In patients with vasovagal syncope, the initial cardiovascular response to an upright posture appears to be relatively normal. Syncope occurs after an abrupt decrease in blood pressure, sometimes accompanied by a marked decrease in heart rate after a delayed period of head-up tilt, which triggers blood pooling in the lower extremities. The mean time to syncope in patients undergoing a tilt-table test is 25 minutes. The dysautonomic response occurs in the presence of a failing autonomic system. Patients with this condition are unable to compensate for the acute decrease in venous return that occurs with upright position, causing orthostatic hypotension. This failure to compensate can occur immediately or be delayed because of blood pooling in the lower extremities. The difference in mechanisms causing vasovagal syncope and the dysautonomic response result in different treatment considerations.######ok i read that on the net, but the thing with my mom is that she does not get light-headed/dizzy or faint. She did not even faint during the tilt table test. Her problem is her blood pressure going so low (50/17) at the time of the test. That is why I do n't understand how the can give her that diagnosis. She did not faint or get faint, yet she had tremendous chest pain/heaviness. I think they may be looking for a quick solution. They want to give beta-blockers, but she tried Lopressor before and it made her sick. Besides why would you give someone with HYPOTENSION a drug for hypertension?

It is also known as postural hypotension, orthostasis, and colloquially as head rush or a dizzy spell, and is a form of hypotension (low blood pressure) in which a person's blood pressure suddenly falls when the person stands up or stretches. Symptoms, which generally occur after sudden standing or stretching, include dizziness, blurred or dimmed vision (possibly to the point of momentary blindness), euphoria or dysphoria, bodily dissociation, distortions in hearing, lightheadedness, nausea, headache, generalized (or extremity) numbness/tingling and fainting, coat hanger pain (pain centered in the neck and shoulders), and in rare, extreme cases, vasovagal syncope (a specific type of fainting). The symptoms are due to insufficient blood pressure and cerebral perfusion (blood supply to the brain). Since you know that this occurs, you need to stand up more slowly, being sure that you have hold of something is case you feel dizzy. You need to make sure you are well hydrated and use enough sodium (salt) in your diet. You should see your physician for an evaluation as to the cause of your symptoms. Certain medicines and diseases are known to cause this disorder. It can be treated. Good luck..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Neurological Disorders

However on 3 diff occasions I have fallen to the floor and started shaking. I did not loose consciousness and it only lasts for a few minutes. Once its done I am fine? Has anyone ever experienced this before?######Well, it might be time to get this hypotension checked out by a doctor because low blood pressure is a problem if it causes dizziness or fainting. When you stand up, gravity causes blood drop to the veins of your leg and reduces the amount of blood that returns to your heart. This causes your blood pressure to drop (orthostatic hypotension). Normally, your autonomic nervous system rapidly accommodates this effect by narrowing (constricting) your blood vessels and increasing your heart rate. But if these mechanisms do n't work normally, the drop in blood pressure can be severe enough to cause fainting. You might want to request a table tilt test, arterial catheterization or, at the least, a blood pressure test. Check it out, though. These symptoms are not normal.######I get the above- low blood pressure and dizziness to the point of virtigo does anyone know if it causes paralyis?

Increased, AGAIN, my salt consumption and fluids intake now 1.5 gal daily (gatoraide) I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and sleep deprivation both that I can attribute to working intensly stressful job that demands 18- 20 hr work days- weekends as well... all just to get the work done. My panic button is pushed repeatedly while working (truly no letting off of it) all day while I am working. So about this fainting. Now I faint when I stand up too quickly, or simply when I am visited by 2 or more friends, even happy emotions/laughing can make me swoon. It 's embarassing to say the least. I usually get about 10- 15 seconds advance notice that I am going down- so I drop to the ground and lay there until it passes. Showering in seated position is now a necessity. Yesterday my GP prescribed Klonopin 2 x daily and some type of super sleeping pill for night. I slept last night for 6 hrs- first time in months. GP tried giving me beta blocker to help with palps/chest pain/flipflps but that makes me pass out. Now GP is sending me for a tilt table test next week with a cardiologist. Could this new/increased fainting be attributed to sleep deprivation, anxiety or both? I never fainted for the reasons I am now fainting and just want to STOP.

The personal trainer took my blood pressure. My blood pressure was 95/74 (I accidently posted 85 instead in another section) and the heart rate was 71. She took it again five minutes later and it was 111/83 and heart rate was 79. She stated that I could n't work out at the Y until I got a doctor's clearance. I guess this shows I could possibly have a heart condition. Even when I walk on the treadmill, I get slightly dizzy and feel like I am going to fall asleep. My resting heart rate used to be at 90, which was pretty high but was normal for me. It is just strange that with exercise, my pulse and blood pressure went down. Anyone hear of such a thing? Very very strange. Anyone else experience this? It 's just strange that my resting blood pressure is normal and my heart rate is higher when I am resting as opposed to working out. I just went to the doctor's today and the resting EKG was normal, which does n't surprise me. He was concerned about my valves. My mom has valve problems (forgot the official name). I will be getting an stress-EKG at a cardiologist in the next few days. In the meantime, I ca n't exercise or do anything strenuous.######It has been a while since you posted this, but it took me years to get a diagnosis so you might benefit from my response. I went through the exact same thing, right down to being kicked out of the gym. My GP did a resting EKG and pretty much called me crazy. He gave me permission to return, but when it kept happening, I went to a cardiologist. I had a 24 hour heart monitor, stress test and echocardiogram, and was told I was fine. They put me on a beta blocker and it did n't help at all. After that, they sent me to an electrophysiologist, which is a cardiology specialty that looks at heart rhythms. The ep put me on a 3 week heart monitor and did a tilt table test, but I think that was overkill. After all that, he said my symptoms were common and classic. I do n't know if it is what you have, but they said I have Vasovagal Syncope. You know those Victorian women who fainted when they got excited or those people who pass out at the sight of blood? My body responds the same way to heat and exercise as theirs did to emotional triggers. Heat and exercise both cause a person's veins to dilate. Fair skinned and thin people are particularly sensitive to this (noting your avatar, I 'd guess you are at least one of the two). In people with vasovagal syncope, the veins in the legs do n't constrict enough to get the blood back up to the head. That causes a fainting, lightheaded, dizzy, or sleepy feeling as the blood pressure drops. Your body is going to get blood to your brain one way or another, so if you do n't do it, your body will do it for you in the form of passing out. If you lie down with your feet elevated, it should pass without your losing consciousness. Some people lose consciousness so suddenly that they do n't have time to lie down. The good news is that most people eventually out-grow vasovagal syncope in middle to late middle ages. Another benefit is that it is n't life-threatening as it is what is called a self-correcting condition. If you get to the point of fainting, your body will correct the problem while you are passed out and you 'll come-to just fine. If you 're like me, you 'll want to avoid the fainting in the first place, and there are some measures you can take to do so. Ask your cardiologist if you would benefit from an increase in salt intake. Some cardiological issues would be hurt by salt, so please do ask. Salt causes fluid retention and it significantly helps in low blood pressure. My doctor told me that it did n't matter how much I was drinking, that I needed to double it. I had to eliminate all diuretics (soda, coffee, tea, etc) from my diet as much as possible, as they get rid of fluid. And I had to re-structure my day to exercise, shower, and do other physically demanding or hot tasks well after I woke up. Blood pressure and hydration levels tend to be low in the morning, and can be really problematic if you have hypostatic orthotension as well (blood pressure drops when you change positions, like getting out of bed or standing up after doing floor exercises). By giving myself more time to get going, and drinking plenty of water at least 30 minutes before a task, I 've almost eliminated my symptoms and the rest I 'm able to control by taking a break to lie down when I first notice the need. If you are still having problems, I strongly encourage you to look into this relatively simple diagnosis. Susie######It took along time to diagnose again, And lately strange really because it literally has just happend exercise makes my condition become significantly worsend, Previously i was in the gym 5 times weekly for two hour sessions now i can only manage treadmil for 5 minute slots. If theres anything you would like to talk about or discuss dont hesitate to message me, Ill help as much as i can Sasha######I think I may also have vasovagal syncope. Any information you would like to share would be greatly appreciated. I am as of yet undiagnosed and getting very frustrated with the process. Thanks !! Jillian######Hi Sasha, Thanks for this blog. My friend experienced these symptoms two weeks ago. He was admitted to the hospital this weekend and continues to feel weak, dizzy, less mobility. He used to go to the gym everyday and runs 5 miles before (even completed half-marathon last November) but now he can not hardly walk. Can you please share was cured you or what corrective action was taken? Your timely sharing of experience and insight will be greatly appreciated. We could be back in the hospital if he continues to deteriorate and lose weight (even if eating well). Can we call you? This is my friend Jose's cell no. -LRB-904-RRB- 662-9888. This is my cell no. if you can not reach him -LRB-904-RRB- 866-6554. Thank you very much! God bless. Marie from Jacksonville######Hi, If you have vaasovagal syncope. . when you get dizzy does it feel like your heart rate slows down? I 've been having problems with my blood pressure (too low) which is worse when I stand up. . Also, I do n't drink a lot of water. . mainly decaf coffee and some juic, and I drink several times a week. . Can dehydration affect blood pressure? Thanks, Jennifer######i have vasovagal syncope and orthstatic hypotension for 3 years, i have to drink at least 3 liters of water a day more on a hot day and excessive salt with my food to stop dehydration as it does cause blood pressure to drop, when you are getting up from sitting or lying down take a few moments to let ur body adjust to the positional change, avoid caffiene and alcohol in large quantities as this also causes dehydrayion, i hope this information is helpful, good luck.######Wow, I think I may have just figured out what is wrong with me. I am 27 and have been having problems for over a year now. I was physically active, thin, in good shape. Got up to go to work one day and could n't breathe. I was getting lightheaded, sick to my stomach, etc.. I went to the doctor and have n't been back to work since. They thought it was my heart, but after a full cardiac workup, they told me my heart was fine. I have been seeing a pulmonologist, who has cleared me for anything lung related. I did a CPET (cardiopulmonary exercise test) twice, and got the same results both times. My blood pressure drops significantly (like 65/40 during the testing), my CO2 drops, O2 drops. And yet they continue to tell me there is nothing wrong, and no reason for me to be having these problems. I am so frustrated. Everybody who has posted on here has the exact same symptoms as me. I guess my next question is: How did it eventually get diagnosed ?? Any information would be great. I 'd love to talk to anyone who is having the same problems. Thanks !!######Wow, very interesting! I have jogged for over 25 years and in the last few I am done before I get started. Instead of my body getting stronger, I feel I am getting weaker. I too get the feelings of nausea, and being dizzy and just like I have to stop whatever it is I am doing NOW! Usually this is a problem that I can over come, with a ``mind over matter '' thing. The other day I was down for the count. I was riding my bike, outside, and my legs got tired so I was walking the bike. The more I walked, the worse I felt. I started seeing just bright white and felt so sick. I called my husband and he called 911. My blood pressure had dropped to 79/30. My husband said my eyes rolled back in my head and I fainted. Scared the crap out of him. I went to the hospital and they ran a ton of tests on me, found nothing but ``fainting '' with no reason why. That is such a strange feeling, I never want to go through that again. It is nice to hear others talk about it, giving me some insight to my own problem. Thanks so much, Sue.######I have the same problem.I 've been fainting ever-since 5yrs old and still at the age of 34. I am frustrated with myself, specially during exercises.I struggle with my weight and the low-blood-pressure does not help either to have an intense workout as well as an diet-plan.

May not be your problem, but it very well might.######I just recently started having problems with low blood pressure. I was rushed to the ER after fainting at the gym and knocking myself out cold on a weight machine. I had symtoms of nausea and dizziness but sat down immediately until the spell passed. I ressumed my work out as normal and the symtoms came back so I sat on a stool on the outer wall of the gym. The next thing I remember is waking up in the middle of the room (20-30 feet from where I had sat down) with people all around me telling me an ambulance was on its way. I work out 4-6 times weekly! I hydrate well and drink only water with an occational coffee. I am now unable to go to the gym (as directed by my dr). She has me scheduled for an MRI and is reffering me to neurology. So starts the grueling testing... Wish me luck!######Wow, thank you for posting this! After my workout i was doing lunges and then a wall squat and when i got up i was so dizzy and my eyesight went blurry for about 30 seconds. I 'm on two diuretics and do n't drink water as much as one should. I drink strong green tea off and on... so it sounds like I have some things to change. Circuit training is a no no for me, I can barely make it 5 minutes without passing out! I had a work up of my brain actually because they thought I might have epilepsy. Thankfully I do n't and it was chalked up to a random fainting spell. Looks like it might not be so random after all and why I 've mostly been afraid to workout!######Does anyone have as part of your symptoms the problem of while you are exercising that your FEET tingle and lose feeling even on the elliptical? And then my FEET start CRAMPING like crazy and my head spins and the other symptoms you all have spoke of set in.######Great to see this continuing post! My problem seems related, although I seem to have both high and now low blood pressure. Re: the low, I play a lot of pickleball... three or four hours a day, or I used to, anyway. Now, if I play outdoors especially, I can feel my blood pressure start to drop. I get dizzy, ca n't focus on the ball, and get very fatigued and weak. If I take my blood pressure, which is often quite high (normal in 140 + over 90 +, can go much higher and I am on one blood pressure med for hypertension) will dump to 70/50. Have had a full heart workup including EKG, two CTs, all lab tests, wore a heart monitor for a day, MRI, kidney workups, etc.. No abnormalities except some restricted flow from one kidney. My weight is normal, age 65.######Has anyone who 's posted been checked for birth defect of the heart? There could just a simple explanation like your arteries and veins get bigger with exercise.

My doctor has never taken my blood pressure, just my aunt who is a nurse, and my dads blood pressure monitor My last blood pressure reading was 76/53 Im a tad worried. Just two months ago it was 96/58. And since then I have been getting dizzy, lightheaded, constant headaches and I am almost always tired. Im not sure if mines low enough to cause this though? anyone have any input? And if it is low, what can I do about it besides medications? I am well on my way to going back on a whole mix of other meds for other problems, I 'd really like to attempt to fix whatever I can without prescriptions first.######I am wondering this same thing-- I usually run a low blood pressure, around 100/65-- since i started taking Zoloft for panic disorder, it had been even lower-- i know most people worry about high blood pressure, but today i took it and it was 89/60-- having panic disorder i immediately started worrying, took it about 5 mins later and it was 105/68. I do feel dizzy and nauseous sometimes, i dont want to over react, but i am worrying also! Let me know how you are doing, MIssy######I also have panic disorder, so i have of course convinced myself I am going to die from this. But I am not on any medications ATM, so I know meds are n't causing mine. I was in the hospital a month or so ago for chest pains, (in comes that panic disorder) and my hearts fine. I do n't know what it could be. I get the dizzy/nauseous/lightheaded symptoms too, and Im wondering if it 's my blood pressure. I also find when Im exersizing, if I do too much, my heart starts to beat really hard and fast, and I get palpitations and it hurts quite a bit. Im not sure if this is from my blood pressure though. It could be. Hopefully someone on here can help us!######I have an aniety disorder and HBP, sounds like your problem is probably the panic disorder. Cass######I really do n't think it is. Ive had this panic disorder for 12 years now, and up until the last few months, my blood pressure has been fine. And I dont see how being anxious/panicked constantly would LOWER my blood pressure, if anything stress/anxiety/panic causes it to elevate. Thanks for your input though. Lady, how old are you? If you dont mind me asking. I have just heard that teenage/young women who dont eat properly tend to have a little lower blood pressure than normal. I dont eat properly, but I eat properly enough that mine should be as low as it is. just checked it... 71/54 ?! I really hope somethings wrong with my monitor######I am 23 yrs old, i think i eat right-- about 8 months ago i lost 35 pounds, could of made me have lower blood pressure? I dont really know what my blood pressure used to be before that, i know when i went for my bp at the docs (many appts due to panic) it was 100/75 and he said that good-- then every time i go to the store (they have a BP machine) i take it and its low, like today the reading of 89/60 something, really scared me badly. I do notice when i stand up i get like that head rush feeling, and ia m tired a lot-- Oh and thank you so much for that info! Maybe it is the zoloft, tho i only take 25 mgs. But who knows! Yours is low, atleat we arent alone, ive been researching and most sites say its ok to have low bp if u dont have symptoms like fainting, dizzy, ect. let me know how you are doing! Missy######Id go get your checked again with your doctor. The blood pressure machines in stores arent always that accurate. It usually tells me I have HIGH blood pressure, when I have anything but. I looked to see if weight loss can cause low blood pressure, but the only way it could I think, is if you are underweight now. Also, I do have those symptoms, so for me I think it is a problem. I will go get mine checked out soon.######Scared kitty- yes that 's too low. Low blood pressure can cause all the symtoms you mentioned plus a few more, including fainting if it gets too way too low. Your doctor should refer you to a cardiologist to rule out anything more serious. As for the ``panic disorder '' I 'm personally convinced that 's a label they give people (women in particular) when they ca n't or do n't want to bother figuring out what 's really wrong. Also, I believe you and maybe someone else mentioned taking zoloft for the ``panic disorder ''? Most antidepressents can cause low blood pressure to worsen. If you want to do a little research on your own, try doing a google search for ``hypotension '', ``neurocardiogenic syncope '' ``orthostatic hypotension ''- see if any of that fits your situation. Good luck, Maggie######Thank you maggie. Well I 've been diagnosed with bi-polar, social anxiety, seasonal affective disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, OCD, panic disorder and a few medical problems. So I found out what was wrong, its just a lot of things lol. But I will agree with you, I dont think panic disorder holds much ground on its own, I think its probably a symptom of a more serious disorder. I have had my heart checked out. Theres nothing wrong with it. But I will go see my doctor and find out what he says. I just was n't sure if it was low enough to worry about. For some people, low is normal. But I havent felt well since it 's been going down, so I dont think this is normal for me.######I 'm glad you 're going back to your doctor. My heart is structurally fine too, but there 's a lot about this problem that they do n't know about. Lots of different things can affect the regulation of blood pressure. There is a wide range of what 's considered normal blood pressure, but your's really is pretty darn low. And just the fact that you have symptoms by definition says that yours is too low. The doctor should check if there 's a difference in blood pressure when standing versus when laying down- it might be orthostatic, meaning that blood pools in the veins in your legs when you stand. You might also ask about having a tilt table test done. I 'm always a little suspicious when someone is diagnosed with as many different things as you are- really makes me think they do n't know and are just guessing at your expense. I have a strong feeling that a lot of these other problems are symptoms of something else (related to the low BP). And it may not be so serious- my low blood pressure (and all the bad symptoms) were aided simply by increasing my water and salt! (this after years of misdiagnoses and different meds, including antiseizure meds with horrible side effects). When they checked out your heart, did they have you wear a heart monitor for a few days to try to catch an event? It 's possible (especially with your panic diagnosis) that you have an arythmia that only appears intermitantly. I wish you luck with your doctor! Maggie######I agree with you about them guessing and telling people they have something just because they do n't have the time to figure out what it really is. I also grew up with a very mentally ill mother, she was the only person around so I think a lot of my problems were learned behaviors as well. Because since she passed, things have magically gotten better and I 've been med free for over a year now, and have n't had very many bad times. So who knows. But they did n't make me wear a heart monitor for a few days. I was just hooked up to one for about 6 hours. And everything was fine. But I will talk to my doctor and see what he says to do.

A few months after starting my anti-seizure meds I started having dizzy spells. My Doctor checked my BP and discovered that my it was low. She told me that seizures had cured me of high BP. I have been off the meds for over two years now, and my BP is fine. Could it be that your meds are causing low BP. Are you even on meds? (I ca n't remember.) Kathy######I 've been having problems with high blood pressure for the last year and a half. I 've had siezures since 1991, but have not had a grand mal siezure since 1998. I have dizzy spells, see spots and have a dazed and confused feeling about once every three to four months. A couple of times they checked my blood pressure and it was like 160/120. So I thought maybe it was high blood pressure causing my dizzy spells etc.. But my mother thinks it might be peti mal seizures, but I thought you outgrowed them and I 'm now 31. I was on clonidine tab .1 mg to lower my blood pressure but it seemed not to go down that much so now I 'm taken Toprol-XL 50mg once a day and the clonidine. I went to the doctor the other day to get my blood pressure checked and it was 128/88 and it been hanging around 120/75. If it starts getting lower I 'm supposed to get back in touch with them. Hope you feeling better...######I 've had life-long low blood pressure (90 over 70). Since I started Dilantin 5 months ago my blood pressure is consistently 135 over 80. Not too happy with that.######Too low blood pressure causes lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue and can cause nausea. If it goes too low, it causes syncope (fainting). Some faints appear very much like seizures. I was n't clear... which started first, the low bp or the seizures? If your bp has always been low since starting the seizures, maybe you have neurocardiogenic syncope rather than epilepsy. I ca n't remember- did you have an EEG and was it conclusive (spike wave pattern)? I was misdiagnosed with epilepsy for 20 years, now they think it 's neurocardiogenic syncope, not seizures. There 's a woman on another board that has both.######hi all well i just checked my bp and im 90/50 and i can tell that today is not going to be good for me thanks for your replys jessie ------------------ mother of 3 ages 4,3, and 1 my pride and joy diagnosed with epilepsy jan. of 97 live life to its fullest you never know when it may be to late to do all the things you would have done tomorrow######maggie all of my eeg's have come back with the abnormal spike waves showing seizure activity i have always had grandmal seizures so im deff. not fainting we know that i have however fainted before because my blood pressure wsa so low. im not currently on any meds for anything. so it cant be a reaction from meds causeing although when i was on topamax it was the first time in about 8 years that i had a normal bp my drs were amazed oh well id better go im getting dizzy again thanks all ------------------ mother of 3 ages 4,3, and 1 my pride and joy diagnosed with epilepsy jan. of 97 live life to its fullest you never know when it may be to late to do all the things you would have done tomorrow######Hey Jessie- Actually, syncope can mimic grandmal, but if you have spike wave patterns on the EEG, that 's pretty conclusive. Also, if you have a lot of confusion afterwards, that 's also pretty conclusive for epilepsy. However, your current symptoms of lightheadedness with low BP definately point to NCS (especially since it sounds like you are not taking any medications that might lower BP.) Honestly, it sounds to me that you may have both. I think this is worth talking to your doctor about- and maybe go see a cardiologist. Maggie.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Epilepsy

Constantly dizzy, faints 4 -6 times daily. During this time it could last 1min. to 1 hour, at this time she does not respond to pain stimulus, or anything. She can not hold food, water, meds down. Thus she will become dehydrated. She was on a feeding tube for a while but this had to be removed. She is very tall but weighs very little at this point. Because of fast weight loss and other factors she now has a pacemaker. We have been to numerous Hospitals and Doctors all over the United States. She has yet to be diagnosed. This is her 5th year of being ill. She had to drop out of school and can not drive she can not hold a job. She can walk to her mail box only because she knows her neighbors and if they see her on the ground they know she will wake up and will wait by her for her safety. If anyone has heard of these symptons please let me know.######I havent heard of there symptoms but i am sorry its something your daughter has to go through. Seeing a Dr would be my recommendation however i can see you have been to numerous. Good Luck Natalie######I assume she has unexplained low blood pressure? Low bp can be from a number of things very hard to cover all with so little info on your daughter. Have the docs checked her thyroid ie tsh, t-4, and free t-3 levels-- were they at the low end of normal? Low bp can result from shock, very few doctors are aware that food sensitivities can result in shock and lower bp. Get a blood pressure cuff i prefer the omron available at walmart, and stay setting with some one helping start testing different foods one at a time leaving 45 minutes between. Take a control (starter) reading, eat test food, wait 30 to 45 minutes and check bp for a change. The most likely culprit is a favorite food or one that is craved. Once you find offending food just eliminate it permanently. Two or three grams of vitamin C can help relief symptoms it acts as an anti-histamine. If this does not help find cause, seek out a Naturopath trained at a four year on site university. Our families favorite is Dr. Ian Nesbit in Missoula Montana. Good luck and God bless! J.D. Wolff######This has all been addressed, but thank you for your info.######Has she tried a low physiological dose of t-3 the active form of thyroid hormone? Dr. Denis Wilson wrote a book on reverse t-3, in essense not all t-3 is created the same, in chemistry there is a term for this, but i 'll save you the details. Normal lab tests wo n't distinguish the difference and will show everything in normal range, however reverse form is not active in the body. Does she exhibit other signs of low thyroid function? The naturopath that I previously suggested teaches physiology at the college in missoula, he might be a worth a try.

Dr's (general md's) have always told me that 's good b/p and i 'm lucky but I 've always thought they were wrong and that was not right. Are the dr's right?######For the most part your BP is really good even though at times it seems low. Unless your getting dizzy or light headed when it is low then I am assuming it is normal for you. As far as the faster heart rate, are you drinking enough fluids, as being dehyrated will give you a faster heart rate. For most of my life I had low BP then out of nowhere in 2000 it went up. Dr. actually thought his equipment went bad so he tried 3 other rooms with BP machines. At the time I was having very nasty stomach problems. Over the years we have noticed if I am ill and a bit dehydrated both my BP and heart rate go up. Even though I am now on meds. for BP, it is well controled till I do n't feel well and get dehyrated, so watch your fluid intake. Best of wishes... JJ...######When it 's low I do get dizzy lightheaded and have passed out before. I drink a lot of mnt dew maybe that 's why pulse is so high. Thanks for replying######An abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia, above 100 at rest) can cause low blood pressure. The rapidly contracting ventricles do not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before the each contraction, and the amount of blood that is pumped decreases (low cardiac output = heart rate times stroke volume for 1 minute interval) in spite of the faster heart rate. Dehydration can give you a high heart rate and low bp. The lower the better for blood pressure according to my doctor, however, if too low that can cause fainting, but as long as one does n't have that side effect the low BP is beneficial. However, the underlying cause for the high pulse rate should be determined and treated whether it is related to your low BP pressure or not. Take care, Ken######Well passing out and getting dizzy is n't good, especially with a high heart rate. I seriously do n't think the Moutain Dew has anything to do with it, if anything all the salt in it should raise your BP. Even though your Dr. is n't concerned about your low BP they need to find the cause of the high heart rate. Keep us posted... JJ. .######is that the first time you fainted? if so it may be a 1 time thing, if not fainting needs to be addressed. dr's have largely ignored my fainting over my lifetime and I fainted driving one day a few years ago. a few weeks ago I fainted hitting my head on the corner of my tub which is tiled and knocked myself out causing a severely sprained neck, so please be careful w/fainting issues######The obvious, serious health problem is your overweight condition. When overweight your metabolism is dysfunctional. A dysfunctional metabolism can cause all kinds of nasty health problems, like blood pressure problems, racing or erratic heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, breathing problems, mental confusion, etc.. Everyone is different. Some people can live their lives very much overweight without suffering from health problems, others ca n't. Mountain Dew contains caffeine, which is a heart stimulant. It also contains sugar, which can also cause problems, especially if one is consuming more sugar, and other carbs, than the metabolism can properly handle. The ``smoking gun '' to your health problems, and solution, could be as simple as your weight and diet. Take care.... best of health and luck to you!######Research ANS and Dysautonomia/Autonomic dysfunction; most likely this may be due to your ANS system. You can find info on the National Dysautonomia Research Foundation, Dysautonomia Information Network and quite a few other great places that have Dysautonmia Forums that have more of an understanding about the ANS and issues. You can also research on Vanderbilt's Autonomic Center and they have a page about ANS issues with a HR/BP test you can do at home- ``poor man's tilt table test '' where you can see how your bp/hr do. It may be that you have one of the ANS conditions such as POTS, NCS, NMS, PAF, MSA, FD, HSAN, OH, OI and more. Not every patient has every symptom and not every patient has the same degree of problems others do. If it is your ANS causing this, you 'll need to find a doctor who understands ANS issues; it 's pretty common but most doctor's do n't think of this first. Either way, fainting and recurrent dizziness is nothing to play around with and may take some effort on your part in pushing your dr's to find the answer. I went from age 9 -42 fainting and tachycardia/arrhythmia issues and finally a doctor did a tilt table test to find out what was wrong- had I known about these conditions earlier and a TTT I would have gotten a correct diagnosis alot sooner.######Your profile says that your are taking some medications that can have all kinds of unpleasant side effects, such as low blood pressure and dizziness among many other possible side effects, including palpitations and dysrhythmias. What role do you think that your meds have to play with your problems?######I do n't really think the med's have much to do with it I 've only been taking them off and on since I had a kidney stone in may and am now only taking ditropan. Have had the low b/p all my life. Also have only gotten overweight in past 8 to 10 years. I 've never passed out while driving only when standing and I 've learned to be careful doing that..######-Heart-Vascular###-Heart Disorders

My bp averages 145/95. I started an exercise regimen for about the last 8 months I was exercising every other day, 30min cardio and about 20min weight training. I did not modify my diet at all. After about 6 months I noticed my bp had dropped down to the 120/70 range (without medication) give or take. I took it several times over the course of a month and it had indeed gone down, at least according to my home bp moniter. So I decided to stop taking the bp meds. Fast forward a couple of months my bp has gone back up to where it was before. I did miss exercising for about 2 weeks earlier this month due to a vacation, but have started exercising again in the past week. I must say I am flabbergasted about being back in the high range so I started my meds again. I have not consulted with a Dr. Maybe I should n't have stopped taking my meds to begin with. Any ideas why it has gone back up?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-High Blood Pressure and Hypertension

Thx!######Hello, Welcome to ehealthforum Blood pressure during exercise increases but the exact changes depend on what type of exercise is being performed.During static exercises (as weighlifting) both systolic and diastolic pressure increases but during dynamic exercises like swimming, running only systolic pressure increases. Dehydration is a state in which the water intake is less than the output.Due to dehydration the blood pressure may drop down since the intravascular space (space within blood vessels) is depleted of fluid.

Recently my resting heart rate has dropped to about 55-65. This concerns me because I have a high blood pressure still (174/9. I 've recently cut way back on alcohol and cigs. Also stopped eating dairy (for the most part). Any suggestions would be appreciated.######Your do n't give your age or sex, but I can make a few generalizations. Alcohol is bad for persons with high blood pressure, and should be markedly restricted or eliminated. A resting heart rate of between 55 and 65 is normal and is more desirable than resting rates of between 85 and 95. Dairy intake relates to cholesterol and lipids, rather than blood pressure. However, it would be desirable for you to markedly decrease your salt intake, and perhaps use a bit of potassium chloride (available as salt substitute in grocery stores). Non-drug treatment of high blood pressure also includes a disciplined exercise program and weight loss where indicated.

Should I go to my doctor?######Congratulations on the drop in your blood pressure! It looks like you are well into the normal range now and I would definitely see if you can gradually get off of the BP meds. Do n't just suddenly stop taking your meds though, especially if you are on beta blockers (it can be really dangerous!) . Your Dr. will probably have you slowly lower your dose and carefully monitor your bp to make sure it does not go back up.

Diagnosed by a doctor who after checking him found he was 170 +/ 90 +-. She prescribed welbutrin and said there is no way this can go down anytime soon without drugs. Now he claims that after a healthier diet change and regular ``hardcore '' working out that a week or so later, he has had regular readings since. Is it even possible to average in the 170/90 +- and 10 days later to be averaging in the norm.######I do n't think that if he truly had chronic high bp that it could have gone down that quick. It is possible however that he had situational hypertension or that the medication is working for him. BTW, I have never heard of prescribing Wellbutrin (an antidepressant) for high bp.######My BP was 160/100 a while back. I have been doing a lot of exercise and it 's now usually 120/90 -100... sometimes higher in the evenings. I figure that getting fitter has helped with the top number- but made no differece to the bottom one.######He was able to do so because his blood pressure was short term stress induced...

Your time is much appreciated######Hello, Welcome to ehealthforum Your symptoms are indicative of GERD or reflux disease.Since the symptoms are very severe you require a Endoscopy whioch would help in knowing if there is presence of any ulcer.Regarding the medication Nexium taken empty stomach has good response in reflux patients.You can discuss with your Physician regarding its use. Also I would advice you to get an Endoscopy done.Have healthy diet and avoid spicy, fatty food intake.Drink lots of water. Take care!######Thanks, I think the nexium 40mg really did help. I feel a lot better and I was just taking it for a few days. I was just wondering does taking domperidone help the absorption and effectiveness of omeprazole/nexium. As omeprazole is required to be taken on an empty stomach and domperidone helps empty the stomach. Because my appetite is very low but does domperidone help in regard to that? I now have to stay off the omep/nexium for two weeks because I am being tested for a bacteria which could be causing the reflux.######I have used a natural Amish remedy to deal with my acid reflux and heartburn for about a year now. There are n't any side effects, and it works in like two minutes. It might be a really great alternative as long as your doctor has no problems with it- which he should n't. It contains only raw and unfiltered apple cider vinegar, ginger juice and garlic juice. No preservatives or anything, but there is some sort of special blending process used to achieve its effectiveness. The only company that makes the remedy currently is Caleb Treeze Organic Farm, and you can pick up a bottle at their Stops Acid Reflux website..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Acid Reflux

But for the last 5 years I 've had trouble with excessive mucus, congestion, coughing, vomiting/regurgitation during or right after meals, constant throat clearing, but no heartburn. It seems the symptoms are pretty common with LPR and I have been taking omrepazole for the last month which has made me feel better but I wanted to make sure that I did have LPR reflux before continuing and taking omeprzole long-term. At the end of my endoscopy the doctor said everything looked normal and he said maybe I have a little acid problem, whatever that means. Also, he prescribed me an anxiety medicine which he said could be part of the problem. I did have a high level of, I forgot which hormone, in my system that the doctor told me is related to stress. What do you guys think?######Provided the endoscopy was completely normal, the only way to confirm the diagnosis in this case might be to do a pH study- (small probe placed into esophagus for 24 hrs to see if acid is refluxing) But as youre regurgitating food at night and your symptoms responded to omeprazole, that gives weight to the diagnosis by itself. I 'd just keep taking the omeprazole for now and think about trial without omeprazole/reduced dose omeprazole after 1 year of treatment..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

I 've had it for 12 + years and have had it well-controlled, up until a few months ago, with omeprazole. Now I 'm really having a hard time again. Anyway although certain foods can make things worse, I get heartburn regardless of what I eat. I can even fast and I 'll still get it. So my question is, what could the cause be? Is it that my LES is just shot? Or is it that I possibly make too much acid? Is there any way to tell?######Yes, it is possible to tell. An endoscopy can examine your stomach, see if you have damage to your LES, or the doctor can actually measure the pH in your stomach (not 100% sure how). There are medications that can cause reflux, are you taking anything other than the omeprazole?######Thanks Jane. I recently had an endoscopy and it came out pretty much normal which is remarkable to me given how long I 've had GERD. I think the omeprazole not only controlled my symptoms well but really protected my esophagus. Going forward though I 'm worried as it 's not working like it used to. Doc just put me on 2x/day dosage a few days ago and I do n't notice any difference yet. I 'm guessing I 'll end up having to try my luck with a different PPI. Some years ago I got the 24-ph monitoring and I remember they said I was refluxing pretty bad during that. I guess what I 'm wondering is over time has my LES just gotten weaker or am I producing more acid. It probably does n't matter too much as they 'll treat it the same way I suppose.

My doctor prescribed omeprazole 40mg generic capsules that is covered by my insurance. It is made by Mylan and is delayed release. He wanted me to try it as a last resort before he calls my insurance company to fight for coverage of Nexium. Unfortunately, this omeprazole is not working well. I did n't notice anything until today (3rd day) and now I 'm having significant heartburn and reflux. I had tried 40mg Prilosec tablets (took 2 pills) before the doctor prescribed this omeprazole and I 'll have to say I think it worked better. I called the pharmacy to inquire and they said the omeprazole has no salts which apparently helps absorption in some? I 'm still not sure about this. If this is the case, why have two kinds? So I 'm thinking to switch to Prilosec tomorrow as I 'm becoming more and more miserable by the minute! Has anyone had different experiences between the two? Is omeprazole magnesium the formula closest to Nexium? Thanks for any help! This whole thing with no insurance coverage for Nexium has really been a bummer for me. Just shows how dependent I am on this medication. Thanks so much. Lori######I do n't know much about the comparison, but I do think you need to give the omeprazole more time. It took me 1-3 weeks to feel better and feel the effects of the medication. Once I quit cold turkey (horrible idea) and it took me 2 weeks back on the medication to feel the heartburn being suppressed. Then the omeprazole started to not work as well (I was on 1 20mg dosage per day), so my doctor told me to increase to 2 20mg pills per day. It took about a 1 and a half for me to feel the effects of that. So, give the omeprazole time.######If the OTC version of Prilosec works, then take that. Everyone's body processes things a little bit differently. That 's why it 's sometimes good to have slightly different medicines to treat the same thing. And, yes, the dependency thing is awful! Do n't you wish they 'd warned us?######I have taken what seems likes every PPI ever make like a merry go round use for able like a few years there it seem to lose some of it potencie anyways I have not found anything that works quite as well as Nexium I do not currently use because of the same issue of no insurance coverage. But you can buy omeprazole with magnesium over the conter in tablet and capsule form I currently use prescription omeprazole once day with prescription Radadine at night as needed. My GI doc says not everyone's body is diff so you have to see what works for you you might also ask about Dexilant which is the latest PPI's it was given to me by my regular doctor as a sample but I have not had a need to take it thank god! This stuff is supposed to be great but as like with anything it may or may not be covered by your insurance. GERD LUCK! Haha right this is what my GI do like to say geezs######Thank you everyone. I 've taken the prescription omeprazole from last Sunday to Tuesday. I then switched from that to Prilosec OTC. I thought it was working better but today I 've had my worst day. I 'm on day 5 now of no Nexium and I 'm concerned that this will get really bad in about 2 days. I know for a fact that Prevacid, Protonix, Dexilant do not work for me. Aciphex works very well but my tinnitus increases so loud that I struggle to sleep. I wish I could take it because my insurance covers it. I do not know if this Prilosec is going to work at all but I 'm praying with all my might that it just needs to build up. I do n't know whether to count the generic and the otc formula to say it is in my system now 5 days? I do n't understand why most of these drugs do not work well for me! The docs do not tell you about the dependence and I wish they did. I tried taking lower doses of PPI's in the past and none of them worked for my reflux/heartburn. I have a small hiatal hernia that should not cause me too much grief but it does! My doctor is not ready to call my insurance company and fight for Nexium coverage. I never thought I 'd be in this poistion where I feel like a drug addict!######I got here by typing ``omeprazole is killing me '' into my browser. I was taking Nexium but I recently changed insurance companies through work and they claim that Nexium is not a preventative medication so it is not covered. I took one Nexium a day and it was all I needed to halt my acid reflux, and I had no side effects that I was aware of. I have pretty much tried everything and nothing else works like Nexium. Sorry if this sounds like a commercial, but I do n't care. I got some samples but recently ran out and began taking Omeprazole. It is tearing me up. I have chronic pain and churning. I really do n't know what to do at this point. I could buy nexium for$ 200 a month, but that 's really not affordable. There are some who claim that Nexium is no different that Prilosec, but they do n't know what they are talking about. I would like to challenge the Insurance Company's claim that Nexium is indeed preventative. Does anyone have experience with that?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

It says to take one (40 mg.) before bed. But then there is a sticker stuck on the bottle that says to take it one hour before eating. I 'm a little confused. I guess the doctor wants me to take it before bed. I do take sleeping pills and xanax occasionally at night at the pharmacist said not to take them at the same time with the omeprazole. Maybe I should call the dr. and ask him if I could take it in morning instead. Just wondering when most people take it?######It really depends on how your doctor prescribes it. Typically it is taken about 1/2 hour prior to a meal, but if you are having a lot of issues overnight, I could see why he would have you take it before bed. As for am or pm, I think it depends on when your worst times are. I think it would be very appropriate to call your doc back up to get clarification on how you should take it.######Do you have most of your reflux issues at night while in bed or during the day? That might tell you when it is important to take it. It does take an hour or so to get into the blood stream and active. This drug takes 3-5 days before kicking in as it reduces the acid producing cells in the stomach over time. The H2 antagonists like Pepcid actually have a more immediate impact on acid, they take only about a 1/2 hr to get working. The PPI's like your taking are more effective once they kick in after the 3-5 day period. I take both, 2 PPI's a day and a Pepcid at bedtime. Was on 20 mg omeprazole 2X daily and 40 mg Famotidine/Pepcid at night. Now taking Pantoprazole 40 mg 2X a day, with the 40 mg Pepcid at night before bed. The GI switched me onto the new drug Tecta after a recent endoscopy. My family doc had put me on Omeprazole. They both seem to work in helping the reflux, only on the new one for 4 days so far. So far so good.######I do n't know if I 'm refluxing at night because I rarely feel heartburn. Occasionally I do, but it 's mild and I might feel a little burning as I try to go to sleep. But not very often. I just have mucus in my throat all the time. And during the day when awake I will feel my stomach bloat up and then I feel the mucus and scratchiness in my throat.######Probably more important just to take it consistently at the same time each day whether that be at night or in the morning..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

More possibilities below: Idiopathic pancreatitis under age 40 Quote: Extensive or invasive evaluation is usually not recommended in those with a single episode of pancreatitis who are younger than 40 but some reports recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) even after one attack if the cause is not clear to look for pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors at or near the ampulla, microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct, and early chronic pancreatitis. Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

I 'm totally not the typical pancreatitis patient- female, thin, fit, good diet, minimal alcohol consumption, no visible gall bladder stones on ultrasound... I had the pancreatitis for 5 days before taking myself to hospital. In those 5 days I saw two different GPs. One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain. My husband died of Pancreatic Cancer 15 years ago. oh, and the depression is worse, of course. Wishing you luck Ann######Hang in there!######Oh gosh, Ann, that sounds terrible. I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment. Can that happen from acute pancreatitis or only chronic?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

Thank you for your help.######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or ther other?

Anything to rule out one or the other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. If you want to rule out diabetes, your doc should help you discover what is going on with you. Hope you can resolve this. Keep us posted. Rose######One doctor immediately said chronic pancreatitis, since my levels have been so high but have rollercoastered over the past couple years. But they ca n't find a cause or a cure for it. All catscans and MRI's have shown everything to be normanl, no blockages, stones, or inflammation.######Pancreatitis and diabetes can be related. If you have chronic pancreatitis, your pancreas is apparently comprimised and not functioning at it optimum level. Have you been referred to an endochronologist? When I was in hospital and not able to have anything by mouth for 10 days, on day 6, they introduced I.V. nutrition. This I.V. bag of `food ' was mostly sugar, with electrolytes and other vital supplements. I have not previously been diagnosed a diabetic, although I was borderline gestational diabetic with my first child and not with the second. The I.V. food bag, caused my blood sugars to be all over the place. I had insulin shots every day- multiple times a day- while the food bag was on the I.V. pole. They kept increasing the insulin in the I.V. food bag, but still needed to give me the shots- my body just was too busy trying to heal the pancreas to regulate blood sugars too. I believe that my insulin levels are not right yet and it has been a month that I 've been out of the hospital now. I need to see my doc/intern and get blood sugars checked as well. Just saw the gastro doc and still have a couple issues from that hospitilization episode yet to take care. I would make sure the pancreas is able to produce the insulin you need- You need to be proactive about it. Keep us posted Rose######I am not a medical professional but I do know from experience that yes diabetes and pancreatitis can be related. I have type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with chronic pancreatitis. They dont know if I was born with the chronic pancreatitis yet but looking back on my life long medical history it looks like I may have been. This is likely to be the reason why I am a double diabetic. So far lots of places I have read about online say that both chronic and acute pancreatits can lead to diabetes.######Thank you for all of the responses everyone. I have never been able to get a doctor to send me to an endocronologist, nor could I get one to accept me, because my blood sugar is always normal. My amylase and lipase are always a mess, but I ca n't seem to find anyone who wants to do anything other than take out my gallbladder. =-LRB- I 've given up for now..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Spent a week in the hospital and was diagnosed with pancreatitis. I was informed and told not to drink and being young and immature (24) I thought I could slip a beer or a drink in here and there which eventually led me back in the hospital for three days. Since then I stopped drinking for a while and one night at a graduation party had a few drinks which led to more drinks which led to pain but no hospital. I have now been sober since that day but I do have pain that comes here and there. When I went for a scan and bloodwork I saw my file and it said chronic pancreatitis. I am going to see a new doctor on the 21st. It seems like their is nothing much that can be done here but start eating better and NO DRINKING AT ALL. I only have my fathers insurance (which is a great insurance) until I am 26 which is 2 years from now. I really want to get the pancreas looked at to see how much damage I have done from drinking heavily since I was 19 years old. I was reading that I should maybe look into getting a contrast-enhanced pancreatic CT scan. Also what are thoughts on oxycodone and roxicet when you are diagnosed with pancreatitis? Sometimes I take these if I am in a little pain but read these might not be good for you if you have pancreatitis as well. What is the mortality rate from pancreatitis? How long do people normally live with this disease? Now that I have a little more informed I still get no definitive answers from doctors or gastros they all say the same thing which is eat healthy and do not drink. I still would like to know more. Thanks for any comments in advance. Brian######Okay I can only answer a few of your questions. I believe that pancreatitis is not cureable, it is manageable though, through diet and meds. As far as taking Oxycodone and Roxy's when your only in a little pain... thats way overdoing it. Heavy narcotics are dependance causing drugs if you take them for long periods of time. You also get used to them over time as your tolerance increases, so you have to take more and more to do the job. This is not a scenario you want to get into to control ``a little pain ''. These kinds of meds are meant for chronic conditions which cause major pain, we 're talking 8, 9, 10 on a scale of 1- 10, all day everyday. So you should really think about that. good luck, kat.######-Health Issues###-Pain Management

The doctors say it was idiopathic and then we found out that it runs in my Dad's family. Then, a year later, my brother also had an acute attack. Since then, I have felt just fine. When I left the hospital, I asked the doctor if there was damage to my pancreas. He said he did not think so. No referral really, and that was that. I felt better and got on with my life. I never really drank alcohol before the attack, and have NOT had ANY since. Over the last few years I have developed a major hypochondriacal state about my pancreas, even though I have felt fine. I have been to the ER 3 times when I had a little burping, panicking that my pancreatitis was back. All three times I was examined and had blood labs run, and nothing showed up. I was sent home and it went away. Lately, anytime I have a bit of a tummyache or anything I panick some more. Would I know if I had chronic pancreatitis since my pancreatitis the first time 4 years ago? I 'm terrified that something is wrong but I do n't know it because I feel good mostly all the time- and I read online that you can have CP but not even have symptoms! Would I have lost weight by now? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am trying to get in with a Gastoenterologist just so I can ask some questions and get some answers- they never referred me after my episode and for 4 years I have been so anxious, and reading the internet does n't help at all.

This was due to my alcohol use. I only drink socially but when I do I binge drink. Im not an alcoholic just a normal college kid. Im having a hard time accepting the fact that I may be able to ever drink again but is there anyway I possibly could if I closely monitor my alcohol use and drink in moderation and cut back a lot? I have been drinking mostly alcoholic energy drinks and vodka since ive been down here at school, mainly in part cuz its the most forgiving to my wallet. Ive heard alcoholic energy drinks are really bad for you and the FDA made a threat to take these off the market recently unless it was proven they were safe to drink. I was also taking nitrous oxide supplements whenever I 'd work out at the gym, so I think this could have also played a factor into this pancreatic attack. I also had a similar attack almost a year and a half ago, the pains were very similar. It was however diagnosed as gastritis so I dont know if they misdiagnosed it or not. Obviously my health is# 1 and I am planning on taking an indefinite time off of drinking until I fully recover from this. It sucks bc my friends 21st bday is in 2 weeks and me and a bunch of friends were planning on going to celebrate in vegas for spring break in 1 month I will most likely be a DD for him on his bday weekend and its going to be really hard resisting temptations to want to drink in Vegas but if I have to obstain from alcohol then thats what Ill have to do. The doctor said I recovered really fast bc I had been taking good care of my body otherwise (diet) etc.. So will there be any possible way I can come back or is alcohol a done deal in my life?######You make the choice: give up alcohol or risk the possibility of recurrent bouts of pancreatitis (and the possibility of a lifetime of suffering due to chronic pancreatitis).

I am not as physically fit as I used to be but I still swim and play basketball weekly. My diet consist of fatty foods and I hardly drink beer but when I do it 's binge drinking, around 5-6 beers about once or twice a month. I went to ER complaining of stools without any pain at all, so they ran stool test, blood work and ct scan and everything was fine but my lipase levels were EXTREMELY elevated at 1700. They admitted me to hospital for a few days and I responded well to clear liguid diet the first day, I was retested and my lipase next morning was at 1050, still high but a significant reduction. Next morning it jumped to 1130. I was shocked and was upset that the lipase was not going down. All my lipids, liver panels and cbc were normal. GI doc said he 's certain it was acute pancreatitis. He then ordered a 2nd CT scan this time with oral and IV contrast and once again, it was clear but GI doc not did talk to me about results, he sent nurse in to send me home. They sent me home only telling me to lay off alcholol and see him in 2 weeks. Why would any responsabile doctor, especially GI send someone home with a dangerous lipase of 1130? I was shocked again. This still left me with many unanswered questons. Maybe you guys can help me out. 1. I get abdominal pain and sometimes mild diarrhea after drinking moster energy drinks, dairy and iced coffee drinks. Pain always lasted for a less than 5 mins and relieved after bowel movement, I never had pain that persisted for hours. I also associated this brief pain with IBS. No D if I stay away from those trigger foods. Does pancreatitis always create severe abominable pain lasting for more several hours? 2. How can a doctor tell if it 's acute or chronic pancreatitis? Can you have multiple acute attacks or is more than one attack considered chronic? From what I read CP eventually becomes less painful due to failing pancreas and amalyse levels are normal. Since I have no pain, I assume it 's CP and those small bouts of 5 minute pains were pancreatitis flare ups. 3. Anyone have insight of survival rate and lifespan with this condition if treated properly with low fat diet, exercise and abstinence from alcohol? I read it reduces lifepspan 10-20 years for any cp patient. 4. Does chronic marijuana use contribute to pancreatitis? I smoke tons of marijuana and I just switched to edibles after diagnosis, even though GI doc think it has nothing to do with it. Thanks.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

History is I have had pain in the left knee and when walking I get a pinching in the knee (grabbing feeling) which stops me in my track. After diagnosis of the pain being from Arthritis, I had a cortisone shot which helped some but did not take away all of the pain. My doctor told me he would not give me another shot unless the first one lasted at least 3 months. I have done PT which causes the knee to swell and hurt after. The physical therapist has now released me because she said my doing the therapy is causing the knee to become inflamed and irritated and that is not what they want to do. I was told by the PT to not do anything for a couple of weeks and then gradually add in exercise- I have tried this and I am gaining weight (which is what the doctor told me to loose to help). The doctor did mention if the shot did not last he would then recommend arthroscopic surgery to clean up the area (trim up the cartilage, etc.). My question is has anyone had this done and did it help with the swelling and pain afterwards. Also, how long were you out of commission or off the leg?.######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Knee & Hip Problems

It is Hard for me to concentrate in school, Let alone get to school. . I have missed a week. I was wonering how long these last, And what else I can use to help fight it.######If antibiotics did n't budge the infection, or it returned, it 's possible you are/were on the wrong meds and you need to switch to a differnt antibiotic. Sometimes sinus infections wo n't clear no matter what antibiotics you take if there is a nasal polyp obstructing normal drainage. I once had a sinus infection for 8 weeks, (no antibiotic was helping) and finally a cat scan of my sinuses revealed a polyp. After the surgery to remove the polyp, the impacted infection could drain properly and I was back to normal. Check back with your doctor to find out why you still feel so lousy. zuzu xx######Sinusitis unfortunately is aggrevated alot by weather and other stuff to. If the antibiotic route does n't help... you may need to see a specialist. I suffer from Chronic Sinusitis. I finally broke down to see a specialist a year ago after suffering for an entire winter with head pain. They put me on FLONASE nasal spray and honestly at first I was resistant, but I have had alot of success with it. I have only had sinus headaches one every few months and I usually can take some Tylenol Sinus and I 'm fine. Also, another good idea is to run a cool mist humidifier where you sleep.

I am not sure what allergy shots you were getting or why they were stopped. Chronic sinusitis is often allergic and can be due to mold infection too. A damp wall in the house, carpets, and ACs are all potential sources of mold. Please consult an allergy specialist. You may need to take the allergy test. Chronic sinusitis can also be due to EBV infection. The other possibility is deviated nasal septum (this was corrected in your case). Nasal polyps and tumors, worms in stool causing high eosinophil counts, gastric reflux are the other causes. The treatment will be complete only on removing the cause. Hence please consult an ENT specialist (you must already be under one) and discuss these possibilities. Depending on the cause treatment will be prescribed. Hope this helps. Take care!######Ime told i have alergies to mold,, i will contact my dr asap and try it again. Whene i was a kid i had allergies to dogs-cats-dust-drass-oak trees- you name it. Ive been tested later on in life and allot of those went away? This simply stinks to have to live like this every day! Thank You !!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Sinusitis

I have nasal polyps and tested positive for mold and other environmental allergies and i have days when everything seems fine but I also have days that i feel like crap. Pressure and/or pain on the face (cheeks, nose and eyes), sometimes even tingling, maxillary sinus pain, upper teeth pain, ear fulness or sometimes pain etc and the doctors I saw said it 's sinus infection caused by allergies so take Allegra D or Zyrtec, use NAsonex, and everything should be ok. As I said, sometimes it is, but sometimes it 's not at all. I 've started seeing a naturopath doctor and I hope it 'll help a little bit, but I was wondering if any of you, the sinus pain sufferer, have any suggestion on what to do to improve my condition. I currently live in a city on the East Coast, with lots of humidity, but we 'll move shortly to Colorado, where the weather is dry and everybody says that this will help my sinus condition. Thanks.######Chronic sinusitis is usually a result of repeated antibiotics being used to treat sinuse congestion. If it is chronic you probably have a systemic candida infection and need to stop with the antibiotics and start with treating the systemic infection. I have had this for many years and finally think i have found the key to treating this thing created by my doctor way back in 1987.######I wo n't get into a detailed argument with the first responder to your post but would encourage you to be extremely wary of that non-scientific advice. The polyps may be the root cause of the infection not clearing. They can block the natural drainage passageways in your sinuses and cause infections to recur almost immediately. Has your doctor recommended anything to help shrink the polyps? Generally a short course of oral steroids followed by the use of a nasal steroid spray and Singulair are pretty effective at keeping polyps from recurring (unfortunately, there is no natural way to deal with polyps, they are difficult to treat and, if not addressed, can require surgery to remove them. Here 's a list: 1. Get a Neil Med Sinus Rinse bottle and irrigate your nasal passages 2-3 times a day. 2. Talk to your doctor about a steroid nasal spray to keep the inflammation at bay during allergy season. 3. Take an antihistamine daily during allergy season (and consider undergoing allergy testing). You really should look for an ENT or allergist who specializes in treating chronic sinusitis so you have someone who can help you manage this (if the ENT recommends surgery right away get a second opinion).######Scientific? I post nothing that is not verified medical fact.######When I lived in Colorado I had the worst sinus infection ever, caused by the dry air and dust. It was Colorado Springs in 1992. I do much better in a moist climate, but that 's just me. At least in Colorado there are good NDs to treat you.######I simply hope that people will take the time to actually verify those ``facts '' before they start thinking that antibiotics contribute to sinusitis. Bacterial sinus infections that are not properly treated with antibiotics can cause serious health problems.######I was given antibiotics and seldane only for my sinuse problems to return a short time later. I now have and have had chronic sinusitis for many years as a result of that witch doctor treatment and have now realized the source of the chronic sinusitis as well as the fact seldane was removed from the market as a dangerous drug. That 's what modern so called scientific medicine has done for me. I suspect you are in medicine and think you guys need to be ashamed of yourselves for what you do to people.######Your suspicions could n't be any more wrong. I have battled chronic sinusitis for 20 years but have had the good fortune to have been treated by 3 incredible doctors (2 ENTs and an allergist) who have helped me get my sinus issues under control. I wasted thousands of dollars on bogus natural treatments before I finally found a doctor who actually specialized in treating chronic sinusitis and I am incredible grateful to him (Dr. Donald Leopold at the University of Nebraska Medical Center) for helping treat and educate me about chronic sinusitis. I do n't want others who suffer from chronic sinusitis to spend the time and money chasing phony hope when there are real, scientifically proven, treatments out there. I certainly understand how people become frustrated because chronic sinusitis is a difficult disease to diagnose and treat, but blaming it on Seldane or antibiotics might just keep someone from getting the help they need to find lasting relief..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

My problems started back when I was about 12? or so. That is when I had my first sinus infection. Since than I get terrible colds a few times a year and have problems breathing. Over the last year or so my suffering has increased, about 11 months ago I began to get a terrible sore throat on one side. Went to a doctor and she told me it was n't strep (got tested) and just a normal sore throat and to get rest. Anyway the sore throat lasted about 2 weeks and was almost unbearable. Than in June I started to get terrible headaches, and felt more stuffy than normal and another doctor told me I had chronic sinusitis, and that I had a sinus infection and told me to use a neti rinse and gave me 2 weeks worth of antibiotics. Than in August the sore throat came back on the same one side, terrible headaches on and off than the sore throat went away. Now starting a few days ago the sore throat has come back on the one side, along with terrible heads and a bit of ear pain all on the one side. Does anyone think this is another sinus infection? I feel like I 'm in and out of doctors constantly the past year. I went back to the doctor last month and was told I had a cold, but this time it feels different. Please tell me there 's something out there that will help me more and I hope this is just another infection. Thank you so much for your time######>> Hi you say you have a diviated septum which could be the cause of your problem! I understand they could fix the septum through surgery! What did your Dr say!

I went to the allergy doc like a few months ago I think November and was givin a breathing treatment allergy testing (Im allergic to everything) and was givin a decongestiant nasel spray prednisone and advair. Never was told directly that I had asthma. Started going for allergy shots. I then started having trouble coughing a lot more wheezing a lot more. I ended up going to the hospital in dec cuz i couldnt breath. Went back to the allergy doc because of it. I told her that the advair makes me cough and it was leaving sores in my mouth even though i rinsed with mouthwash. So she gave me a stronger advair. So I stopped taking the advair but I am now so sensitive to smoke that i start coughing real bad. I sound like i am gon na throw up and start wheezing and i cant breathe most of the time the albuterol works other times it takes hours to make it stop. I went to a pulmonologist a few weeks ago and he did a lung function test on me and told me my lungs were fine and that i probably didnt have asthma. If I dont have asthma then what is wrong with me ?? Should I go to another dr? Am I just being paranoid?######I think you definitely need to see another doctor. I was also tested fro allergies and am allergic to everything (literaly 20 out of 20 things). My asthma is triggered by allergies. Are you allergic to ciggerate smoke perhaps? I have never heard of anyone being prescribed advair (Which i am also on) if they are not asthmatic. I beleive it has been shown to help with allergies as well but it is not an allergy medication it is an asthma medication. sometimes for allergies they give you singulair as an allergy preveative. I definitely think you should see another asthma/allergy specialist to see why you are having the symptoms that yo are having. good luck! Amanda.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

Exercise intolerance is a major symptom of CFIDS. You might want to check out the Chronic Fatigue board as well.######Just a thought: you may want to talk to your doc about another inhaler called INTAL. My son has asthma. He uses a number of inhalants. Straight albuterol is for resue only. Intal was added at the end of the last school year. He takes 2 puffs 30 minutes before gym class or any other exercise to PREVENT an asthma attack. If you were diagnosed with asthma, ask your doc about this and it could ba an option to replace the albuterol.######Emery, How was this diagnosis arrived at? Did the doc just say, ``Gee this must be exercise induced asthma since exercise causes shortness of breath? '' Or did he actually do a pft test? And then a methacholine challenge test to confirm asthma? You mentioned taking meds all your life. If you truly have asthma, and want to take care of your lungs, you WILL probably have to take meds the rest of your life. Years ago, doctors just treated asthma when it flared up. You used albuteral when you needed it. But in the 90's, the medical community changed their thinking. Now they try to PREVENT you from ever having an attack. This is done by using bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Advair combines both of these types of medicines. If Advair is giving you side effects, you could take something else. Pulmicort and Foradil, for example. Some people take Singulair. You and your doctor can work to find out what you tolerate best. About asthma, you mentioned that you hoped you did n't have asthma ``full time '' and hoped it did n't turn into a persistent thing. If you have asthmatic lungs, they are that way ALL THE TIME. It is a permanent condition. But you can feel perfectly normal and have asthmatic lungs. Then every once in a while have an actual ``asthma attack. '' But I would be concerned that the albuteral is no longer helping. I would definitely want to dig deeper and find out the cause. You could have asthma AND another problem. If you have n't been to a lung doctor- pulmonologist- it would probably be a good idea to go. Do n't just go by what your family doctor says.######thank you for the replies. yes plm, that was basically how i was diagnosed with this. i actually had a sinus infection at the time which is why i went in (hate seeing the doctor) and while i was there i mentioned the coughing, tightness and short of breath after exercising thing because i was feeling like crap and it was \*\*\*\*\*\*\* me off that i could n't do the usual. he listened to my lungs and said i was wheezing. he brought in this machine type thing, told me to take a deep breath and blow out as hard and as fast as i could into this contraption. i did this like 3x's and he apparently was n't happy with that. i was pretty surprised at the asthma diagnosis. got 3 cartridges of albuterol with 5x refill and told to hit it before exercising and if any time i felt short of breath. it does help for sure with the exercise thing. so when i started feeling this pressure/need to cough when resting, he prescribed advair and told me to take it every day even if i was feeling ok. but i seriously think that is what is causing me to have weird, vivid dreams. is that a normal side effect? i just do n't want to be deteriorating like this so early on. also, does the shaky, jittery, like having too much espresso thing go away on advil + albuterol? i 'm kind of freaking out now. do i need to go see a pulmonologist now? i do n't think i 've had a pft test unless blowing out into that thing is what that was. sorry so long. thanks again all for your input. i am reading past posts to try to get educated. i just ca n't believe i may have this full time, so i 'm sorry if this is repetitive.######Hi I was diagnosed with asthma about five years ago. At first I only had problems when I was in contact with cats and dogs (allergic), but after a while the problems became more frequent. We n't to my GP who prescribed Ventoline and a cortizone inhaler. It helped at first but the effect of the medications decreased after a year or so. Today I 'm constantly (well almost) coughing and wheezing. I use the Ventoline when I get real bad and it helps pretty well. But the coughing (both dry and productive) is annoying as h \*\* l. When trying to do any kind of exercise it always ends up with me coughing my lungs out and getting of the tennis court... It really sucks! My advice for you is to keep pushing your doc until he or she can give you a medication that you can use and have a normal life. I know I 'll keep pushing my GP until that happens. The test you took was a PFT, so I guess the diagnose is correct. Good luck, keep up the struggle for a good life/ M######The test you took was a spirometry. A pulmonologist will do further testing. There is another one called diffusion testing, which shows how well gases pass through your lung membranes. If the level is high, it can indicate asthma. But the best test is the methacholine challenge. You breathe in a little methacholine and then breathe hard into the machine and it measures. Then you breathe in a little more, etc.. They do this up to 6 times. If you breathing gets 20% or more impaired, they stop the test because you have asthma. Then they give you something to breathe to open your lungs. This test is considered the ``gold standard '' to see if you have asthma. Albuteral can make some people shaky, but it usually goes away. But some people ca n't handle it. Advair can cause bad dreams and some people have an almost hallucenogenic effect from it. It is a great medicine, but from what I read on these message boards, it does cause more side effects than other drugs. Some people just ca n't handle it. But there are plenty of alternatives. Advair combines a bronchodilator with a corticosteroid. With other alternatives, you will actually have to take two drugs separately... who cares. One choice is Pulmicort and Foradil. Also, some people find that one combination of drugs does absolutely nothing for them, but another combination does wonders. So your doc may have to experiment to find out what is right for YOU. But I urge you to go to a pulmonologist and get a full work-up, not just a spirometry. And discuss the side effects. A pulmonologist is going to be more knowledgeable about the different drugs, too. But I still find it of concern that albuteral used to work for you, but now it does n't. Your lungs are not something you want to screw around with. Find out what the problem is. Another great message board to read is (<< <removed> >>) Go there and click on ``forum '' on the left side of the page. It is a very active message board and you will get LOTS of great information.######hi everyone: thanks so much for the replies. plm, thank you for your responses. i have been reading up on this board and trying to educate myself better on all this. what did we ever do without the internet? i feel like i can ask so much more here and get better responses than i do from my doctor. and he 's the one making$$$?######okay one other thing i wanted to add is that i checked out that copd message board and it is active! however, i realized that copd is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. and i 'm definitely not into that. no way... except for that alot of those posts pertained to my situation. okay i smoked for like 2 years in college, is this why this is happening to me?######Smoking does cause damage to the lungs, throat, mouth, sinuses... BUT, your body does heal itself after you are n't smoking anymore and are not exposed to it on a regular basis. Since you say while you were in college, I take that as you have n't been for a while. After a year, your body should have been back to normal by the natural healing process. Did the smoking cause the asthma? I seriously doubt it. Did it contribute to your inability to breath comfortably? It is possible that it did so at the time. You really do need to talk some more to your doctor. I hope this helped put your fears at rest.######COPD is just a catch-all term for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It includes asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema among others.######Hi, I have a history of asthma since the age of 7 (I am 27 now) and have been on the ventolin inhaler for more than 10 years.

It was bad when I was younger, with several er visits before I started getting allergy shots. The allergy shots helped tremendously, and my asthma is much better. I 'm 30 now, and have been getting shots off and on for the last 8 years (I keep moving and having to re-start). For the past several years, my asthma has been well-controlled with advair. I 've been using the albuterol very rarely (like once a month or so). But the past few weeks, my asthma has gotten worse. I 've been having asthma attacks once every week or two, and they are the worst attacks I 've been having in years. One was really scary because I went to bed fine and woke up an hour later and could hardly breathe. The weird thing is that the albuterol does n't really seem to be working at all. In the past, albuterol has worked quite well for me, with one or two puffs completely fixing the attack. For the past few weeks, I 've used up to 10 puffs when I 'm having an attack (over the span of about 20 minutes), and it really does n't even seem to have much effect even then. Usually it happens in the evening, and I end up sitting up wheezing and coughing for a few hours before I can breathe enough to even go to bed. I do n't know if maybe there 's something wrong with my inhaler? I just recently switched over to the new proair inhaler, because my old ones finally ran out (which tells you how well my asthma was controlled, that I still had old ones 2 years after they switched over!) . It just does n't seem to do anything for me at all. Obviously, I 'm going to call the doctor on Monday, because I 've been wheezing since last night with no relief, but I 'm wondering if maybe I need a different medication or a nebulizer or something. It 's just so frustrating, because in between attacks I have no symptoms at all, but when I get an attack I ca n't seem to reverse it. My questions:- Anything specific I should make sure my doctor checks out? - Has anybody else had this problem, and what worked for you?######Okay, there are a few possibilities. One is, you are allergic to the new propellant, in which case you should switch to a nebulizer. I have had all kinds of trouble with rescue inhalers and weird reactions, so it 's not as strange as it sounds. Another is your inhaler nozzle is clogged, so you are n't getting any medicine. Puff in the air and watch. If you ca n't see a nice big puff, the pump is not working and needs to be cleaned. Also, the new inhalers work just a little bit differently. You might not be using it quite right. Ask for training. If you have a bad attack tonight, before you can get to the doctor, obviously go to the ER. If you have bothersome, but not emergency symptoms, try some coffee. When you get there, ask if you need to use a controller medicine, at least until you get this flare-up better. Hang in there!######Jane gave you some good advice. Also, if your asthma is that bad right now, you might ask about getting a nebulizer. It uses a liquid solution of albuterol that works its way further into your lungs. Have you had any problems with acid reflux? ``Silent '' reflux can aggrevate asthma by irritating your lungs. With ``silent '' reflux, many people do n't even have heartburn or other obvious symptoms. For many people, the reflux can be worse at night when lying down. You could try propping up the head of your bed on a couple bricks to see if that might help. What dosage of Advair are you on? You might talk to your doctor about temporarily going up in strength until you get your asthma back under control. You could always go back down at that point.######I 'm actually on the lowest dose of advair, and for the past few years I 've only been using it one puff once a day (and my asthma was controlled, but stopping that resulted in problems). I 've upped it to twice a day and it has n't made a difference. I do n't think it 's a problem with the mechanics of the inhaler, because I 've had the same problems with two different ones. I suppose it 's possible that I 'm not using it quite right if it 's significantly different from the older models. I do n't have any heartburn problems (no symptoms, plus two endoscopies showing no evidence). Other than the one attack, they usually come on in the evening before I 've gone to bed, not after I 've laid down.######Are you taking the Advair at night? If not, switch to then and see if that helps.######Yes, I 've always taken it at night. Now I 'm taking it morning and night. I called the allergist and they were willing to get me in tomorrow, but I live an hour away from them, so I 'm going Friday instead.######It is common for asthmatics to have more problems at night than during the day. There 's a hormone in your body whose levels drop at night time. Besides helping you fall asleep, they also give you a breathing boost (sorry I 'm not using very scientific terms here). If you 're not already using a nebulizer (I know it 's been mentioned several times already) I would check into it. I 'd be in the ER every month if I did n't have my own nebulizer. Often times my inhaler seems to ``quit working '', but the nebulizer will do the trick for me. Are there any allergens in your bedroom that might be setting you off? If you 're allergic to dust, dustmites, etc- you might try getting covers for your pillows and mattress. Things like plants, stuffed animals, old carpet can be allergen triggers as well. Some people get HEPA air purifiers and they help too.######It 's definitely allergy-related. I have the most problems on the weekends when I stay with my friend out of town. That 's why I waited so long, because I thought that maybe the problem was smoke from the woodstove. But even now that it 's gotten warmer, I 'm still having problems. It does n't seem to be the bed, since I end up having trouble breathing before I go to bed. I 'm highly suspicious of the cat, since I am allergic to them. The funny thing is that my friend has borderline OCD, and cleans all the time. Vacuums at least every other day, mops the floor, dusts... She empties the fridge entirely once a week to clean it, and then spot-cleans in between (not that I 'd be allergic to the fridge, but that 's an example of how much she cleans). In contrast, when I visit my parents I do n't have any problems, even though they have 3 cats, and my mom only cleans when there 's company coming (I doubt that house gets dusted more than twice a year, or vacuumed more than once every few months). It just does n't make sense. I guess it 's a good thing that I do n't have more problems at my parents' house, though, since I 'm moving in with them in August to go back to school!######Ugh. My allergist was just about entirely useless. Apparently if you pass your PFT with flying colors, then your asthma is well-controlled and you ca n't possibly be having asthma attacks. So, since my breathing is so good other than these asthma attacks, she suggested that I increase my advair, and see if that helps the albuterol work better. Nevermind that I 've doubled my advair and it has n't helped one bit. But maybe doubling it again will be magic. She also suggested that maybe I 'm not having asthma attacks at all, but just spasms of my larynx caused by acid reflux. Nevermind that I 've got absolutely no symptoms of reflux, and have had several GI-related diagnostic tests that would have shown evidence of reflux if I had it, and they showed no such evidence. Plus, I 've had asthma all my life. I know what an asthma attack feels like. Wheezing, tightness in the chest, mucus, coughing, etc.. Plus, I get these asthma attacks mostly when I go to my friend's house. Now what is more likely, that I 'm allergic to something there and it 's triggering my asthma, or that I just happen to have asymptomatic reflux only on the weekends, and only when I go to a certain person's house ??? She suggested a spacer (I absolutely hate spacers). Then she suggested to maybe try another brand of alubterol inhaler, but she did n't have any samples of any other brands in stock, and I just got the proair refilled so insurance wo n't cover another albuterol inhaler prescription. Then she looked at me and asked what I wanted to do (since I was n't buying her solution of just increasing the advair). So I asked for either a different rescue medication, or a different delivery system. She looked pretty annoyed, but wrote me a prescription for a nebulizer. My friend actually has a nebulizer at her house, so I 'll try that this weekend and see if it helps before I go buying my own, but I suspect that it will. It 's just so frustrating when the doctor does n't believe you.######Dude, I 've been dealing with this for three years. I 've fired 3 doctors in the time span. I eventually switched to a different allergist in the same practice and I 've had a much better experience. I 'm the same way with PFTs. I used to do 130% of expected and now i 'm in the 90 to 110 range. Most doctors see that as still being awesome, yet that 's most frustrating for us. I also keep track of peak flow numbers. For my age, height, etc I should be around 625, but I can hit 900 if I 'm feeling good. It 's hard to find a good doctor that will actually listen and not just look at the numbers. Hang in there. I 'd try out the nebulizer. They work wonders for me. I have both a big workhorse, and a smaller portable one. You should check out the Pari Trek S. Mine came with a battery pack, AC adapter, and car adapter. It only weighs a few pounds so I just take it everywhere I go in my backpack. Beats dragging around the big one. Good luck.######Yeah, my doctor can be the same way. Yes, it 's good to have high peak flows. It means you 're probably getting enough air to do things like stay alive and conscious, and probably to walk and talk too. But the charts are only an average, and some doctors tend to ignore reported symptoms if the breathing tests are within the normal range. My allergist recently referred me to a well-respected pulmonologist, who said that my asthma is more the nuisance kind than the severe kind, but is not well controlled at present. He had a number of suggestions for me, which I 'm now following up on. I 'm not sure about doubling up the Advair. Is that much Salmeterol safe? Should n't you be on a higher number (like 250/50) instead? Definitely give the nebulizer a try, and let me know how it goes.######Doubling the advair would be safe. The standard dose for any of the strengths is 2 puffs twice a day. I was only taking 1 puff once a day, and doubled it to 1 puff twice a day (made no difference) and the doctor wants me to double it again to 2 puffs twice a day (the standard dose).######I thought the extra salmeterol was n't safe too. I used to be on the 500/50 dose for years. Tried going down to the 250/50 for a while, but when that was n't working I was back on the 500. My doc told me I should n't take extra ``puffs '' of the 250 cause I 'd be getting too much salmeterol.######Ah, you were on a half-dose of the HFA version, and she wants you on the full dose. That 's fine. I would n't take MORE than 50 mcg of salmeterol at one time, though.############I 'm new to this so take w/ a grain of salt. However I 've been reading for 18 hours a day for 2 weeks. I 'm getting drugs alright, but I 'm trying to treat the condition rather than symtoms. This is what I 'm doing (I have mostly nocturnal asthma): Keep room humidity 50% or less, get a good air-purifer (most you can afford, IQair the best) clean the house no carpets drapes etc., Vitanins A, B, C, D, E, magnisium, betacarotene, calcium and LOCAL HONEY! Sleep only on left side or tummy, right side ok but not back! Hard bed not soft > Buy a R-100 mask$ 10-15 each and wear it outside as much as possible. That 's seems to help alot so far.

I have an albuterol inhaler that my allergist gave me, so I used that, and it helped get my breathing back to normal. I checked my peak flows a couple times that day, and I was in the yellow zone, so I used my inhaler every 6 hours. The following evening I used my inhaler and then went for a run about 20 mins later. I ran about 2 miles with no breathing issues at all. Being that I had some trouble breathing the day before, I continued to closely monitor my peak flows. I usually do n't pay much attention to them, but I was still feeling short of breath, and my peak flows continued to be in the yellow zone. The next morning, I was walking from my car to the building I work in, and I had to go up three small flights of stairs to get to the office. When I reached the top, I was completely out of breath, and had to stop at the top of the stairs and rest and calm my breathing down. Later that morning I walked out to my car, and by the time I got down the stairs and through the parking lot, I could barely breathe. My chest was tight, my breathing became very rapid, almost like I had just got done running, but worse. I used my inhaler, and soon enough I was able to breath normally again. About 4 hours later, I was sitting at my desk, and all of a sudden the same thing started happening again. My chest got really tight, I was really short of breath, I was sweating, and I got really dizzy. My co-worker also told me afterwards that I had no color in my face. My peak flows during this were in the red zone. I again used my inhaler, and my symptoms went away. I left work early and went home and slept the remainder of the day. When I woke up the following morning, I was still having issues, and my boss insisted that I go to the ER. The ER did a chest xray, CT scan, blood work, and came to the conclusion that I have allergy induced bronchospasm. I have since been referred to a pulmonary doctor. He started me on Advair 250/50 and is going to have me do a pulmonary function test, an exercise challenge test, and if needed, a methacholine challenge test to confirm his diagnosis that I have allergy induced asthma. My question is, I have never had an asthma attack before, so was the breathing issues I experienced two weeks ago a flare-up/attack? How do you know if it was an attack? I never have any wheezing, but I usually have a horrible cough afterwards. Please if anyone has any ideas about what happened, I would greatly appreciate it. I just want to make sure I am getting treated for the right thing. That honestly was the scariest thing ever, not being able to breath normally!######One does not have to wheeze to have asthma/attack/flare-up. (Gosh, why do people think it 's a requirement for asthma ????) anyway, it does sound like you had some asthma attacks. Do what the pulmonologist told you and get tested. Getting on proper meds to control it is your best bet.######I agree. Sounds like asthma. And your doctor is doing the right tests to make sure. The Advair should provide some benefits right away, but it 'll take about 2 weeks to get the full benefit, maybe more. If it is allergy related, though, you 'll probably feel a lot better once the pollen season ends, which will be first frost at the latest. Did the pulmonologist suggest taking an antihistamine?######Thanks for such a quick response. Unfortunately I was afraid that you guys were going to think it was asthma. I am in the military, so this could possibly end my career. I have heard of some people that were able to continue to serve, but they had to prove that the asthma was well controlled with meds. I am also taking Singulair, Astelin, and Allegra. He has me only taking the Allegra for a week, but continuing to take the rest. I go for my PFT and exercise challenge test in two weeks. Can you have a normal PFT and still have asthma? What about the methacholine test, can it be normal and it still be asthma? My doctors have ruled out all other possible things that this could be, and they all seem pretty certain it is asthma. I will keep you posted on how things go with my testing, and thanks again for your responses.######If your asthma is under good control, or if you have a large lung capacity to begin with, you may have normal PFTs. However, methacholine challenge generally does NOT miss asthma, unless it is VERY well controlled. Now, if you want to continue to serve, find out what the requirements are for demonstrating control in your case. Take your medicine diligently, be sure you are using the inhalers correctly (there are videos out there, or ask your pulmonologist's nurse), and minimize your exposure to allergens. Do n't lie about anything, but do your best to get your lungs healthy and avoid another flare-up.######It does sound like you had some asthma attacks. I get bronchospasm also and I find that Advair is the best at controlling it for me. I can do my lap swimming daily miles w/ no problem, etc.. When on Advair I hardly ever need to use albuterol. My Dr. said that if I needed to use albuterol more than twice a week that my asthma was not well controlled. (!) There are professional athletes and Olympic athletes who have asthma and who continue with their active lives, so, assuming that you meet the requirements for demonstrating control, I would n't think asthma should be a career-ender for you.######I am hoping that all will be okay, especially now that I am on medication that seems to be working pretty good. The fact of the matter is, that the military frowns upon asthma. You can not get in if you have it. I went through what we call a medical board, a board that determines whether or not healthwise if you are able to continue serving. I had ovarian cancer two years ago, and went through 4 rigorous cycles of chemotherapy. I was a completely healthy young woman up to that point. I am worried, because if this is in fact asthma, another medical board will be generated. I do n't know if they will keep me, being that this is will be my second board. I think there comes a point in time, where they will say that I am just too sick to continue any longer. That will super stink, because I have 13 years in and I would hate to throw it all away now. I know my health is important, and it is what it is, I ca n't make the asthma go away. I am just hoping I can keep my career !! I am making sure that I take my medicine correctly and not missing a single dose. Hopefully, I can be on of the few that can prove it is well controlled and save my career. Right now, all I can do is wait until they test me on the 12th and hope for the best!######So, an update from last time. I went for my pulmonary function test this morning. All was going well, then I came to a part of the test that I could n't complete. They gave me two puffs of albuterol and then asked me to inhale as deeply as I could. I was n't able to breathe in deeply enough to complete this portion of the test. What does that mean? Next, they wanted to do my exercise challenge test. I did n't understand why they would give me an exercise challenge test after giving me two puffs of albulterol. When I asked, they said this is what the doctor wanted. Come to find out, after I completed the exercise challenge test, they told me that I have to come back tomorrow, because the albuterol would affect my test results. Can anyone answer why after given the albuterol, I could n't inhale deeply enough. I will post again tomorrow after I complete my second exercise challenge test, but was just concerned about my inability to complete part of the pulmonary function test.######Okay, so I went and did my exercise challenge test again today. Here is what happened. The technician had me try to do the DLCO portion of the pulmonary function test since I could not perform it the last time. Again, I could not inhale deep enough for them to do the test. The technician said I had to reach their baseline, and that I only get three tries. If I do n't reach the baseline, within three tries then they do n't continue with the test. Next, they took be into the treadmill room and started up everything. They put one of those things on my finger that monitors heart rate and oxygen levels. She then started the test. What I am confused about, is that she did not get my heart rate up to its maximum rate. I did n't even work up a sweat! She had me walk for ten minutes. Then they took me back into the spirometry room and had me do the spirometry at 5 mins, 10 mins, 15 mins, 20 mins, and then 30 mins. My results came back negative for exercise induced asthma. What I do n't understand is that is n't the test supposed to mimic exercise conditions that would bring on asthma symptoms. I know that when I am outside running, I get chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough. I had absolutely none of these symptoms, but then again, it was like a walk in the park... I was n't even the slightest bit winded afterwards. My numbers dropped a little bit, but not enough for the test to be positive. Did they do the test wrong?######This sounds like a poor way to determine whether or not someone has exercise-induced asthma, BUT, this may be the standard for you to stay in the military. You just have to do the brisk walk without triggering it. I would guess that if you were in a combat role, the standard for lung health would be much higher.######So, I think I just had another asthma flare-up, attack, bronchospasm or whatever you want to call it. This time it happened while I was laying in bed surfing the Internet before going to sleep. It was so sudden, like the last time. It started with this really odd feeling in my chest for a few seconds. Then, after that the really rapid breathing/shortness of breath started. Unfortunately, my inhaler was downstairs in my purse. I took two puffs and thought I was ok. I went back upstairs and tried to lie down and it started up again only this time I heard a little bit of wheezing, which I never have. So two more puffs... and I am doing fine now. I have n't been diagnosed yet, but I am wondering if I should call my doctor tomorrow. I do n't have no action plan, so I am not sure if I should change my medication amount for the next day or so. I am concerned, because last time this happened I was in the ER. This is really scaring the ``you know what '' out of me! Please any advice on what to do would be really helpful!.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

Odd thing is I am now hoarse and lose my voice each day. It has occured to me that this has gotten worse as I continue to use the Advair. Have any of you experienced this with Advair usage? I am not wheezing, but have a ``thick '' feeling airway. Chronic non productive cough. Could the Advair be makeing me worse ?? Thanks for any help you can lend me! God Bless!######I do n't think you have to worry about making your condition worse. Advair is an inhaled steroid and will very much help your breathing. It is designed for inflammation such as what you experienced with your bronchiitis. I use Advair 250/50 and have been for about a year for my asthma. It does tend to make my voice a little lower and raspier. It will help to gargle with some cool water and rinse your mouth after using the Advair. And then drink some more water. It helps a lot. You should n't have to be on Advair long term unless you have asthma. Hope this helps. Cindy######I was extremely hoarse (and it did n't seem to matter what I did to try to change it) while on Advair 500/50 and 250/50. Finally I 've been making it on 100/50, and I am not hoarse anymore. A little when I try to sing, but I have hopes to start getting off advair altogether by Christmas this year.######Hi Doodle! I too was on the 500 and YES it did make my cough/asthma worse. I have taken myself off of it now and doing much better. I have done a lot of research on Advair, and there is lots of controversy over some of the side effects of it. My doctor insist's that I stay on it, but it truly did make me worse. Go Figure Good luck with your daughter.############I was on Advair 100/50 for a few years. Yes I was always hoarse but worse I would experience terrible heart poundings that would often wake me up at night. I switched to QVar-- found no relief-- even worsened asthma symptoms. So just today I was put on Pulmicort Inhaler. I hope for the best. I had awful results from Singulair too, which gave me a bad case of bronchitis-- cough- cough! I dunno-- it 's so hard to get it right!######I seem to be okay on 100/50 dosage- I do n't cough, not very hoarse as I said previously, and I do n't have to use albuterol so often- which actually gets my heart racing faster and more often than the lower dose of advair. It all depends on the person, I guess.############Hi I really am thinking the advair is part of the problem...... tempted to just remove all meds ~ dr. continually says not to do that at all! This has been going on a month! Anyone else gone of meds and done ok?######I have had a hoarse voice from my Advair for about 3 weeks. 2 days ago I went off the Advair and am using Mescolor only for my asthma/allergies. I have had episodes of this before. Does anyone know how long before your voice is back to semi normal? I have been on Advair 250 for 2 years. I hope I can stay off.############I, too was on Advair for a number of years. Not only did it cause hoarseness but also heart palpitations (due to the Serevent component). The corticosteroids all affect me in one way or another. I feel they make the asthma symptoms worse. I 've taken myself off everything except Albuterol as needed. I feel so much better in many ways but the symptoms do persist and I pray that I can get by on the Albuterol alone. I will give it a couple of weeks and then try the QVAR inhaler again if I ca n't manage. Sometimes I feel all of these meds bring on asthmna symptoms-- they 're all horrible. Please tell me what other inhaled meds you 've tried and to what degree of success? Deenie######I do still have my Albuterol. That is the only inhaler I have used. Before the Advair I was on Accolate. Really did n't have alot of side affects from it but my doctor took me off of it. I would say because of the new warnings that came out about the Accolate. This is day 3 with no Advair. I am still hoarse but I think my voice is a little stronger. How much longer ??######Hi! I 'm wondering- now that you 've been on the Pulmicort for a month- how you like it compared to the Advair. I have been on Advair for almost 4 years now- and am completely convinced it is the cause for the degradation of my life quality. I have SO many health issues now that I did not have before starting the Advair- that include EXTREME anxiety and agoraphobia, hyperthyroidism and a 50 pound weigh gain- that I am unable to shed regardless of diet or exercise. My friend has recommended Pulmicort to me, but I am skeptical. While Advair does come with a LOT of horrible side effects- I also have n't had to use a resuce inhaler in over a year. The comfort of that alone- has been enough to keep me relying on Advair all these years. I tried to come off it last summer, (they started me on Singulair)- but I started having more severe asthma than I 'd had before I started the Advair. Any input/suggestions/advice would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks so much !! Alicia Stepp######You might suggest to your doctor if you can GRADUALLY lower your dosage. Right now I am on 250/50 and notice aching joints and gaining weight. I now use it once a day instead of twice and might try the 100/50 in time..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I have tried to go without advair for a few days and I just ca n't breath. Hope you find the answers you are looking for. Take care Johna######The answer to both is yes. There is no cure for asthma so there is no expectation to get off the meds. And I really HATE those TV ads that have led people to believe you have to wheeze to have asthma.######I will always be on Symbicort? Maybe I can go to a lower dose at some point? How long have you been using Advair, Johna?######Well, you 'll always be on some med. I started at 4 puffs of Flovent a day. I 'm down to 1 per day now because we got it under control. So if you 've had no problems for a period of time (I assume you 're seeing your pulmonologist every 6-8 months), then I 'd ask if you could delete one puff per day with the understanding that if you start to have problems you 'll add it back. That 's what I did over time and got down to the once per day.######I thought I 'd jump in this thread and ask a few questiuons as well.... so, you can have asthma with only shortness of breath? What kind of shortness of breath? There are so many variations. What about tightness in the throat but none on the chest? What about not being able to stand pressure on the throat, say from a pillow at night. Or, does anyone experience feeling like their throat is twisting shut when you turn your head. Sorry so many questions, but I 've been ecxperiencing breathing difficulty for several months and ca n't figure out what is causing it. No cough, no wheezing but my throat gets tight sometimes, feel like I ca n't get a deep breath sometimes or just feel like I have to make myself breathe. It varies how it feels from day to day. it is scary and vary frustrating so any help would be appreciated.######Yes, that could be asthma. The best solution is to see a pulmonologist and get tested. It could also be gerd, acid reflux, etc..######what exactally do they do when they test?######Usually just the Pulmonary Function Test where you blow into a tube. They can also do a methocholine challenge but usually a PFT is sufficient. Along with listening to your lungs. Nothing horrible!######My dr listened to my lungs and had me do a hard sharp blow. She said usually if there is any wheezing it can be heard doing that, but she said there was none. She also told me to try to blow out when I get the breathing problem. She said to count to 20. I tried it and can breathe out okay. I 'll ask about the tests. What about hoarseness? I also get hoarse sometimes.######I had the same things that Titchou had done. Then they had me use Albuterol and repeated the PFT 20 minutes later to see how I responded to the Albuterol. They also took a really thorough medical history about all my symptoms, allergies, etc..######Hoarseness too is a symptom of asthma, acid reflux, etc.. What kind of doctor did you see?######Yes you can have asthma without wheezing or coughing just tightness in chest can be from asthma there are inhalers like advair for daily use and rescue iinhalers like provental ask your dr######I have no tightness in my chest..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I was born with Asthma and was on Alupent as a kid, usually going to the ER twice a year is a normal event for me. I have tried all the meds I can think of, Singular, Advair, Albuterol, Prednisone, Asthmacort, I have a nebulizer in my home and use it often. I am overweight by about 100 lbs and I am working on it slowly, but as you all know it is tough with breathing problems. I do n't have health insurance so I have to pay cash for my prescriptions, I have friends that let me use there Albuterol inhaler prescriptions and I pay cash for them, I use about 4 inhalers per month weather I am sick or not. I hoard Prednisone in my medicine cabinet incase of an attack as well as neb treatments. The last few years my asthma has gotten a little better, my bosses brother is a doctor so he will see me when I am chronically sick and give me any samples avaiable, The last few times I had an eposode I requested the doctor give me Zithromax incase I just had an infection and this seemed to cure my problem. 2 weeks ago was my last attack, I started with 100mg of Prednisone and tapered off 10mg per day until better along with the zithromax, now I am sick again. I have a very stressful job and I am very dedicated to it, I sometimes think this could contribute to my Asthma flare up's, I thought about asking for Valium or something but dont want to use addicting drugs or sound like a drug addict, I also think using my inhaler is all in my head, when I am out of breath I take a puff, this may happen 20 times a day, I ca n't go anywhere without it in my pocket. Right now I am back on the Prednisone, 50mg yesterday, 40mg today, 4-5 nebs per day and my inhaler. I am also very allergic to certain things so I try to stay away from natural herbs and such. I am searching for an air purifier right now. I find it sad that it is so hard for someone like my self to find medications to control my asthma without a prescription, I think I should be able to get these sorts of things on eBay or something. I have 27 years experience dealing with this disease and can usually tell doctors exactly what I need. Anyway sorry for the long post and sob story, but any help or suggestions would help greatly. Yours truly, Weezer21######1. At four canisters of Albuterol a month, there is no way humanly possible you are not exceeding the recommended daily dosage. You are putting yourself at risk for long-term cardiac side effects, perhaps resulting in death. 2. There is no such thing as a physical addiction to albuterol. Four nebs a day OR eight puffs a day is the recommended maximum. Exceeding this outside of a supervised (emergency room) environment is not recommended under any circumstances. 3. Hoarding prednisone and then starting yourself on obscenely high doses against medical advice is not going to improve your situation any. It 's probably part of the reason why you 're so overweight. Prednisone is a last-ditch emergency measure, not something that should be used chronically for control. A steroid inhaler is something that you should look into for control. 4. Examine your environment and see if you can make any environmental changes that would decrease the allergen load and your symptoms. Look at long-term therapy with anti-histamines, if you have a series of known environmental allergies. 5. Valium is not something that should be used to control asthma. It 's a drug with the potential for abuse, and with your history of not following doctor's recommendations when it comes to dosing with medications, I would agree with you that it 's a very, very, very bad idea for you to start on something that \* does \* have the potential for physical addiction.######I so agree with WRIN. I think your weight problem is adding to your breathing difficulties as it is very hard to get enough oxygen to the body when the body is large. PLEASE lose some weight, get away from so much Albuterol and try to stabilize yourself without as many meds as possible. The albuterol can not help if the wheezing is weight induced.######Hey guys, Thanks for all the advice, concerns and feedback. I am going to do as Wrin suggested, but first finish off my last dose of Prednisone, I really only use it 2-3 times per year, but I ``feel '' better to have it in the cabinet just in case. I have joined Lifetime Fitness, which is 24 hours so that should help with my funny schedule. I have an appointment to have Culligan install an air purification system in my house this week, the one with the UltraViolet and Ozone bulbs, I have heard that this works wonders for allergies and such and I will be sure to let you guys know. On the same note I am also having them install a reverse osmosis drinking water since my tap water tastes gross, I believe I will drink more water before and after meals. Next step is to rearch this book that Linda36 reccomends. I really appreciate the input from everyone and I am going to work hard on this. I really do n't remember ever using my inhaler as much as I am now and I have never been this heavy. This will be the hardes habit to break since it is so easy to reach for it when I become out of breath, but so hard to leave it places incase I really need it. Take care everyone, Wheezer21######Follow some of the recommendations to reduce allergen loads in your home, first. An air purifier is a great second-line measure, however if the allergen load in your home is very high, an air purifier will not be able to do as good a job. A start is some allergen-proof pillows with dust-mite proof covers, and a mattress cover to reduce dust-mite transmission from your mattress. Make sure to vacuum or sweep your bedroom at least once a week, and launder all bedding and curtains in hot water at least once a week as well. Try and keep pets out of the bedroom, if you can. Dust mites thrive in moist environments, so try turning down the humidity in your home using whichever method is appropriate. Ensure your furnace filter is in good condition, your ventilation system is clean, and your carpets cleaned.######OP, I believe by law all the major pharmaceutical companies are required to offer free name-brand drugs to uninsured people (I 'm sure there are probably income restrictions). One guy on this board said he signed up for free Advair pretty easily. Do some research, ask your doctor, etc., but I think you need to get on advair or some such corticosteroid and get off the albuterol. The albuterol is more like a bandaid and does n't help the inflammation in your lungs.######Hi, I was born with Asthma too and used my Albuterol inhaler `as needed '; probably more than 8 times a day. I was having a hard time getting 2 inhalers per month and have been put on many different ones intended to reduce my reliance on albuterol. While chatting with my PM doctor (I take morphine for my bone and joint disease), I found out that her friend is an Asthma researcher. The friend is also supposed be be writing a paper on the addictive qualities of albuterol inhalers, so maybe there is some merit to your thought. I was supposed to contact her to share my thoughts, but never did. I ca n't tolerate Prednisone, so I usually take Dexthamesasone (Decadron is the generic). I had a severe attack in late 1995 wich ended with me having been on Decadron for months, and I gained over 30 pounds. Last year I had pneumonia and while I did get Decadron for the entire week I was in the hospital (3 days in the ICU and 4 in a regular room), I quickly tapered myself off when I got out. I 've also lost most of the extra weight, but rather unhealthily- a loss of appetite side effect from Actonel and Fosamax (I have osteoperosis). Luckily, Advair has been a lifesaver. When I was given a sample to `try out ', I decided to give it a serious try and now, I take a single puff every day. It has also dropped my reliance on Albuterol down to almost once a day. Some days I even skip it and I only seem to need it if I sneeze or laugh too hard. Before, doing either of those would almost give me an attack. I 'm sorry it does n't work for you though..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I have had asthma since I was a kid but it suddenly stopped at age 12. The asthma recently returned and I was really shocked because I believed I was not going to ever have this problem again. I have had a cough that wo n't go away for about a month or so. I went to the hospital and was prescribed some antibiotics, prednisone, and a albuterol inhaler the problem is that they seem not to be working. . The cough does not go away and if it does it comes right back and I start up wheezing and coughing up phlegm (light yellowish-green color). They did a chest x-ray last time and it came out clean so I do n't have pneumonia or bronchitis. Why wo n't my cough go away? What other medication might be better for my asthma ?? I just want this coughing and wheezing to get better !!! Please help. .######Are you on a daily inhaled steroid asthma medication? (Asmanex, Flovent, Advair?) Perhpas you need another course of Prednisone? How long were you suffering before you went for treatment? Perhaps you have acid reflux and that is causing your cough? Have you been checked or treated for that? I had SEVERE asthma from birth to age 8- then it went `dormant '- it returned when I was 28- and I still have it. I am 34. I hope you find some answers and start to feel better SOON. Vanessa######Hi thanks for responding. . I do n't take any other meds. Last night I went to the ER and they pescribed some more Prednisone. I am experiencing some acid reflux so that might be what is trigerring the cough and I think I might need a daily med to control my asthma. . I will be seeing my doc soon so I will let her know about my acid reflux and about changing my meds.######I hope the prednisone gives you relief quickly. While you wait to get into your Dr. for the daily maintenance asthma med- maybe you could try OTC Pepcid A/C extra strength or Prilosec OTC to help with the acd (especially because taking Prednisone can make that worse). Maybe treating the acid will help your breathing too. Best of luck and please let me know how you make out. I 'll say a prayer for you. Vanessa######Thank you so much for the advice and the prayers. . I will try the pepcid ac for the acid. . Thank alot I will update you once I see my doc. .######Hi Jade, I went to a chinese doctor and he gave me the following herb formula: 9 parts ``ling zhi '' 4 parts ``kushen '' 2 parts ``gan cao '' All I can tell you is that this has been miraculous for me. I used to use a steroid inhaler 6-8 times a day- I am down to maybe once a day (if that). Try to get this formula if you can. It is wonderful. Y Best Sandy######Thanks for the idea. . I would love to see a Chinese herbalist and will look into it. I should have some luck finding some in China Town. . Well I am looking into the that, looking forward to getting my blood test results from my doc and might make an appointment with a Asthma specialist clinic that I found in brooklyn. . I just want this coughing, hacking up of phlegm and wheezing to END! I need a brake from feeling like hell. . Thanks again######Coloured phlegm indicates a chest infection, you should probably go back to your doctor soon.######Hey Charlottie and Jaade, How are you both feeling? Any better? I hope and pray so. Vanessa######Heya Vanessa, I 'm fine thanks, this cough is still bothering me though. How 're you?.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma
448	89	5ca10faac061d65f32bedfa5	http://www.healthboards.com/boards/asthma/881252-methacholine-results.html	1	Methacholine results.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma######Hi all! I have posted here before, and I absolutely love this forum. I recently had a methacholine challenge test and I am confused by the results. I went through all six vials with no issues. However, I drank a soda earlier that day and I am wondering if that altered my results. I told the nurse when I showed up to my appointment and she said it was okay. Anyways, I was fine until after the last vial. I was released, because initially I had no asthma symptoms, but I was not given any albuterol afterwards either. By the time I walked through the parking lot to my truck, I was having symptoms. I did n't go back in because I was told that symptoms after the test is normal. My pulmonologist has not ``officially '' diagnosed me with asthma but I am being treated as if I had it. I am on Advair 250/50 twice a day, and Ventolin as needed. I have noticed a huge difference in how I feel since being on the meds. Does this mean I do have asthma, even though I had a reaction to the methacholine after the test? My pulmonologist said I could have good lung function since it is early onset. I am just confused !! I really do n't understand this disease and I have a hard time recognizing my symptoms. I wake up almost every night in a coughing fit, I can hardly run because I ca n't breathe and my chest feels like its on fire when I get done running. I feel at times during the day as if I ca n't breathe well or take a good breathe, is that normal for asthma? Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.######Asthma is a highly individualized condition. While there are general symptoms and parameters, it 's not cookie cutter. Everyone has to figure out there own situations. Things such as severity of lung damage, weight, size of chest capacity, fitness, activities, environment, etc, etc can vary greatly and make major differences. Anything activity that causes symptoms on a regular basis should either be avoided or premedicated beforehand. So, if you jog, dnace, hike, etc- 2 puffs of albuterol beforehand. If you are waking up during the night coughing and you 've taken care of the bedroom environment (mattress and pillow covers, humidifier, etc) then try premedicating before bedtime. Going out in the cold bother you? Premedicate if you are going to be outside for a while. Since you are a runner, when you encounter an issue, fall back on your running breathing and see if that will help. I do n't premedicate before dancing because I `velearned to use my jogging breathing to control things then. I went to a football game recently where my seat was on the next to top row of the upper deck- and I did n't have my albuterol with me. Had to walk slowly, regulate my breathing and by 2 minutes after we sat down, I was fine. It 's frustrating but you 'll get there. It just takes time to figure it all out.######Responding to albuterol is strong evidence that your symptoms are caused by airway constriction. Airway constriction could be caused by an infection such as bronchitis, but if it 's been going on for a while and you are n't sick, it probably is asthma. Definitely, learn to listen to your body where symptoms are concerned. Here 's a weird fact about my body that I learned, back when I used a rescue inhaler: It 's normal to need a puff here and there. But if I want a second puff the minute the first one wears off (5 hours, usually) that means I 'm getting out of control, and I should figure out why and take steps to address it. From what you describe, you are n't under control. Those are very typical asthma symptoms. The Advair should help, and it may help more the longer you are on it. But you also need to figure out your triggers. Clearly exercise is one. Is it worse if you run outside in the cold? I find that for me, exercise is usually OK unless it 's cold out. Of course, premedicate before running. Doing a proper aerobic warm-up and cool-down may also help your lungs handle it. If you took your Advair before the test, that could definitely produce false negative results, though!######I definitely notice my symptoms are worse when I run outside in the cold. I use my inhaler 15 minutes before I run, as that it what my pulmonologist told me to do. I have had these symptoms for a little over two years now, so I do n't think it is because I am sick. I was not on any meds when I took my methacholine test, but do n't understand why it had no effect on me until after the fact. I am just really struggling in figuring out what my triggers are. I had a pretty bad coughing fit yesterday at work, and I thought at first it was just a tickle in my throat, but drinking water did n't help. The only thing that worked and eased my coughing was my inhaler. I am tired all the time, like I do n't have the energy I used to have. Sometimes I am just sitting at my desk and I have shortness of breath, is that the start of an asthma attack? Usually when this happens I use my inhaler, because I ca n't control my breathing any other way and it starts to get worse if I do n't use the inhaler early on. I understand each case is different, I just want to make sure that I am being treated adequately so I can go back to enjoying life the way I used to. The cold definitely has an affect on me, as well as smoke, and exercise. I do n't understand the symptoms I have at work as there is nothing other than maybe dust that would trigger my symptoms to flare up. Thanks for you advice so far, so glad this forum exists.######Have you ever been tested for allergies? That could be playing a role. Definitely, when you start feeling short of breath, use your inhaler if you think it 'll get worse. If I 'm just outside for a couple minutes, and I know my lungs will calm down as soon as I get into the warm, I do n't use it. But if I 'm going to be outside a while, I will. It sounds like asthma really is affecting your quality of life, and if the Advair is n't cutting it, you may have to add something else, or try another medicine. I found that Symbicort was more effective than Advair. Hang in there. For me, it took over a year of treatment to get under control, and I still have flare-ups, but things are much better than they were.######Do any of your coworkers use fragrances. That is a pretty common trigger in the work place. Closely related to this is is automated spray deodorizers. Smoke is another irritant and even though most work places are smoke free, some of us are sensitive to the smell of smoke that clings to smokers clothing. Pay attention to what you were doing, who was there, and what the environment was like and you should be able to figure out at least some of your triggers. Good luck.######Thanks everyone for your responses. It sure is a help to know there are other people out there going through similar things! Most of my co-workers do n't wear perfumes and I do n't have any air fresheners in my office, because those do bother me on occasion. The only thing I can think of that sometimes triggers my symptoms is being overtired or stressed. Can either of those trigger asthma symptoms? I guess most of my confusion is that I did not react to the methacholine during the test. It was n't until afterwards when I was walking to my truck that I started to have symptoms. Would this be counted as having a reaction? I was under the impression that it was n't, because even people without asthma have some type of reaction to the methacholine. I did use my rescue inhaler once I began having symptoms and it worked. Now, I have had this persistent cough for the last month that will not go away. It gets worse at night and I have woken up 3 times just this week in a coughing fit. I usually take my inhaler and within minutes I stop coughing... are these coughing fits my asthma flaring up? Did n't realize there was so much to this disease that I have to learn.######If the albuterol works, then it 's asthma. That 's all I know to say... that 's the proof in the pudding. Try the albuterol before bedtime and see if it helps any. Hang in... you 'll figure it all out!######So, an update from last time. This morning I was rushing to get out the door, and had to run back upstairs for something. By the time I got out of the house and into my truck, I was coughing like crazy and a bit winded, but not to the point where I needed my inhaler. Later on today, I had to do some work outside. It was only for a brief amount of time, but everytime I was outside I was coughing. I was with three other people who all seemed to be fine, but I was coughing. I have noticed that sometimes when I laugh, or talk, I start coughing. Is this normal for asthma? I took my inhaler last night before going to bed and that seemed to help. I did n't wake up coughing. I have been on Advair 250/50 now for a couple of months and I thought most of this would have stopped happening by now. I am good with remembering to take my medicine and have only missed a dose here or there. The weather here has changed over the last couple of days. Temperature wise it has been in the 50s during the day, but it was raining most of the day yesterday. I have n't had any wheezing, but I normally do n't and my chest has n't been very tight, but the coughing is just really wearing me out! Does anyone know of any books or websites that I could read or research. I have so many questions about asthma, but do n't want to be a pest to my doctor or his nurses all the time. Thanks again, for everyone's responses, it really helps me to deal with everything!######Yup, coughing from laughing is often an asthma thing. When my lungs are bad, laughing will make me cough.######Glad the albuterol before bed time helped!######I was recently diagnosed with asthma a few months ago and I found that keeping a journal of my symptoms has helped me better pin point my triggers. I have been keeping a log each day of when I take my medicine and when I have symptoms. I have found that stress and allergies are my biggest triggers. It may be worth getting tested at an Allergist if you have n't already. I realized I was much worse at work and a HEPA filter on my desk has helped a lot. (I 'm allergic to dust and the air quality is n't great in my building.) I was also able to make the connection between my dog sleeping in my bed and asthma attacks. I 'm allergic and I did n't feel like my allergies were acting up but they were bothering my asthma. Good luck!.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

Just a constant shortness of breath. Had chest x-ray which showed hyperinflated lungs (too big). PFT test was good except FEV25% -75% was low, which shows restriction in lower airways. Methacholine challenge test for asthma was positive. DLCO was 127% of norm, which indicates asthma. Pulmonary doc said asthma. I 've been on Pulmicort (inhaled steroid) and Foradil (bronchodilator) for 3 months, and Singular for 6 weeks. Still feel exactly the same, no change. Went to allergy/asthma clinic last week and doctor said this sounds like odd behavior for asthma. Just a constant SOB, no asthma attacks, no wheezing. Today I had allergy tests and was positive to almost all 56 things he put on my back. So I 'm going to start the shots. I do n't have a runny nose or watery eyes or any of the usual allergy symptoms. Just a constant mild shortness of breath. I know my lower airways are restricted, but it is odd that the Pulmicort, Foradil, and Singulair have n't made a change in this feeling. Has anyone else felt like this and taken shots? Did they help?######I have sob alot but i dont take anything, mine is more when i am exercising, does it happen when your exerting yourself? I dont wheeze nor cough either. I think alot of might be just out of shape but I dont know. It never got that bad that i needed to take medication.######Hello, for the last two years i have had problems breathing. I got pluresy (probably spelled wrong) and it just hurt to breathe (i just wanted to die) and i should say i was in great shape before this happened (exercising at least 2 hours every day, most days 3 or 4 hours). then i was told i had allergy induced asthma on the fourth of July (it hurt to breathe and even though i was not wheezing i felt like the air i was taking in was n't making it all the way in. The inhaler seemed to help, but when i exercise or go up a flight of stairs i feel like the only thing i hear is my breathing. This really brings me down because i do n't feel like exercising. Today i feel like \*\*\*\* again. I feel like the air that i am taking in is not going in all the way, maybe like something is stopping it. I seem to smell mold a lot from outside and it is irritating. also when i cleaned the bathroom the fumes were really bothering me from the cleaners (i had the window open). Have you found out anything new? Have you noticed any changes? I think i need to go to an allergy specialist too.######My suggestion is to go to a pulmonologist and get a pulmonary function test done. Find out if you have exercise induced asthma. You could be having ``mild '' asthma attacks. But they could get worse and you could have problems with your lungs if you do n't get this treated. Doctors used to just treat the asthma attacks when they happened with inhalers like albuteral. But in the 90's the medical community changed their thinking. Now they feel that you should be on broncodilators and cortico-steroids to PREVENT the asthma attacks. The idea is to keep your lungs open and reduce the inflammation. Personally, I do n't believe in ``guessing ''. I do n't like it when doctors say ``maybe you have asthma, here try this. '' I think you should get proper testing so you KNOW what the problem is and then treat it. I have just started my allergy shots. I did notice on my results that I am extremely allergic to dust mites (it 's actually their poop that you are allergic to). So I 'm trying to do the things you should do- encase bedding in dust-mite proof covering, I 'm getting new carpet (which I was going to get anyways), I 'm going to buy some mitacide for the furniture, etc.. I 'm putting my bed pillows in the freezer for about 12 hours each to kill the mites before putting on the pillow coverings. So far, I feel about the same. But allergy shots can take 6-12 months to start working. And even the corticosteroids for inflammation can take that long. So I 'm plugging along hoping all this helps.######I do have asthma (was diagnosed a few years ago), and I have pretty much the same symptoms as you are describing. Originally, the preventative medication I was on was Intal. However, after trying it (and a few others) for a while, it did n't do much good. About a year ago, I switched to Advair and could tell a huge difference from the start! I highly recommend Advair for anyone with asthma !!! The fast-acting inhaler that I use is Albuterol. Good luck with everything!######aluv4labs, You said you have the same symptoms. Are you (or were you) just mildly short of breath ALL the time? That is the ONLY symptom I have. I 've never had an asthma attack. But this SOB is constant; the same all the time. I have changed to Advair after 3.5 months on the Pulmicort and Foradil. I 've been on it 3 weeks. I find it much easier to use, but I have n't noticed a difference in the shortness of breath. I 'd love to email with somebody who has the same symptoms as me. So please let me know if that is what you meant: that you were sob all the time. And did the Advair take that away?######Wow. . I ca n't believe how much your symptoms sound like mine! I started with a constant feeling of having to catch my breath and shortness of breath one year ago. It is some better at times than other times. . went to pulmonary dr. xrays showed hyperinflated lungs and FEV was low at 70 though he did n't seem concerned about it and said that it was hyperventilation. I know it 's not that but like u I had allergy testing and was allergic to everything they tested me for (I now take 3 shots a week). . I have an albuterol inhaler which helps somewhat at times but really not enough to mention. The allergist said it 's not asthma but it 's very frustrating and scary for me. I have breathed so hard that I have caused my ribcage to expand and be sore too. Well now that I have finished my book I 'll say goodbye and gl to you. Just wanted you to know you 're not alone. Take Care######Anything lower than 80 on an fev1 is usally considered asthma. Mine is usallly less than sixty, in fact, I 'm lucky if it is fifty, but usually you are considered a mild asthmatic if you have a lower fev1 and then a higher fev1 after albuterol treatment..######-Health Issues###-Allergies

Carpal tunnel syndrome describes a condition generally known as a peripheral entrapment neuropathy. Specifically, the neurological pathology is caused because the median nerve (the peripheral nerve which goes from the hand to the arm) gets squeezed (â$ entrappedâ$) at the wrist. Among other things, the median nerve controls sensory information sensations from the palm side of the thumb and fingers (not the little finger). The nerve passes through the carpal tunnel. This is a canal formed between wrist bones and the ligaments that hold them together. The canal forms a passageway for the median nerve, the tendons of the flexor muscles of the hand. The entrapment occurs because sometimes the tendons and other tissues thicken. This narrows the carpal tunnel causing the median nerve to be compressed. The result of this squeezing is manifested differently in different people. It may result in pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, and sometimes these sensations radiate up the arm. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME? It is extremely rare for the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome to begin quickly. Instead, the symptoms generally start gradually. The person feels sensations like tingling, burning or itching numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers. It is especially pronounced in the thumb, index and middle fingers. Often, the fingers feel swollen, even though they are not. These sensations can occur in one or both hands simultaneously. It is most common for the symptoms to first appear at night. Many people report waking up and having to wring or â$ shake outâ$ their hands. If symptoms worsen, the sensations last into the day, generally with tingling. As the condition progress further, the person might feel a decrease in grip strength. It becomes difficult to make a fist or grasp small objects. In severe and chronic cases that re untreated, there is wasting of the muscles at the base of the thumb and people lose sensation of hot and cold. You can do 3 simple tests which are consistent with a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (but, for course, are not necessarily definitive tests). If you answer yes to any of these tests, then you may have carpal tunnel syndrome. 1. Phalen Maneuver Flex your wrist gently and as far as possible (i.e., bring your fingers as close to your wrist as you can). Then hold this position for 1 minute. Do your symptoms- especially numbness- appear or get worse? 2. Tinel Test With your hand straight, lightly tap the skin over the crease in your wrist. Does it result in a tingling or â$ pins-and-needlesâ$ in the hand? 3. Durkan Test With your hand straight, apply firm pressure to the wrist crease for 30 seconds. Relax for one minute, and then apply firm pressure to the palm (just past the wrist crease) for 30 seconds. Do either of these make your symptoms (especially numbness) appear or get worse? HOW IS CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME TREATED? Carpal tunnel syndrome is not something you just get rid of with drugs, shots, or surgery. You merely suppress the symptoms because the underlying cause is both anatomical and physiological. We do n't know why it rears its head when it does, although some believe repetitive strain brings it on, but more research is needed to be sure. The traditional treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome attempt to relieve pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. However, no single treatment choice is right for every person. The factors to consider for treatment depend on 1) How severe the symptoms are and what 's causing them, 2) How long the symptoms have been felt, and 3) How much the symptoms affect the personâ$ s life (at work and home). Once diagnosed, treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome should begin as early as possible, under a doctor's direction. The underlying causes (such as diabetes or arthritis) should be treated first. An initial treatment generally involves resting the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks. This means avoiding activities that may worsen symptoms, and immobilizing the wrist in a splint or brace to avoid further damage from twisting or bending. Cold packs are used if there is inflammation in order to help reduce swelling. Carpal tunnel syndrome treatments fall into two general categories: surgical and nonsurgical. Both have potential risks and benefits. NON-SURGICAL TREATMENTS Most people with carpal tunnel syndrome should at give nonsurgical treatments a try. These treatments work best below the age of 50 and if the symptoms are mild to moderate, not constant and began less than 10 months prior to evaluation. The great advantage of nonsurgical techniques for carpal tunnels syndrome it that they are less invasive than surgery and most people obtain at least short-term relief from one or a combination of nonsurgical treatments. The great disadvantage of nonsurgical techniques for carpal tunnels syndrome is that they usually are effective only in cases of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. They may not provide permanent symptomatic relief especially for advanced cases. Also, nonsurgical treatments may lead a person to postpone an operation that is inevitable. If too much time elapses before deciding on surgery, it may reduce the chance of a completely successful operation. Activity modification For most people, the position of the wrist position is vital to controlling the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. The more the wrist is bent, the more pressure is put on the median nerve. Therefore, precautions to take in order to protect oneâ$ s hands include: Reduce wrist bending. Avoid bending the wrist all the way up or down. Relaxing grip. Avoid gripping too hard when driving, writing or using hand tools. Most people use more force than necessary when doing hand tasks. Choose tools wisely. When writing, use a thick pen with an oversized, soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink. Modify hand tools such as going from a straight handle to a pistol grip. Avoid vibrating tools. Take breaks. When performing activities that require repetitive, forceful motion with wrists bent, stop every 15 to 20 minutes and gently stretch and bend the hands and fingers. Use proper posture. Poor posture causes the shoulders to roll forward, shortening the neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in the neck. Keep hands warm. Pain and stiffness are more likely to occur if hands are cold. Splints Splints (braces) are the most commonly used non-drug treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome. These immobilize the wrist in a neutral position and most people use them during sleep. They are generally effective to varying degrees Active medical devices The Carpal Therapist is a relatively new device and is unique in that it is an electrically powered massaging device. It combines the immobility features of the brace with active therapeutic massaging as from a physical therapist. Electrical motors in the brace massage the tendons of the wrist, stretching the tendons and reducing swelling in the carpal tunnel. The Carpal Solution is a device very much related to a brace in its concept and to some extent, its function. This reportedly causes stretching and re-shaping of the wristâ$ s anatomy using a three pronged tape system. WristTrac is another device targeted for carpal tunnel syndrome. This device is a brace with a built in stretching mechanism and reportedly results in stretching of the forearm tendons in a manner similar to traction. Physical therapy When the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are mild to moderate, physical therapy or special hand exercises can be used for relief. There are certain exercises that can be used which include gliding exercises to help relieve carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms, and when used in combination with other treatments, such as splinting, they appear to be more beneficial. Ultrasound and contrast baths are said to provide short term relief, but may not be very effective in more severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. Drugs The most common treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is symptomatic relief using drugs. Drugs can ease the associated pain and swelling, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen. Diuretic pills (``water pills '') can decrease swelling and may offer pain relief. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) or the lidocaine can be injected directly into the wrist or taken by mouth (in the case of prednisone) to relieve pressure on the median nerve and provide immediate, temporary relief to those with mild or intermittent symptoms. This is also true of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplements. However, persons with diabetes and those who may be predisposed to diabetes should note that prolonged use of corticosteroids can make it difficult to regulate insulin levels. Exercise In situations where symptoms are not too severe, stretching and strengthening exercises can be beneficial. These exercises should be supervised by a doctor or physical therapist. Additionally, an occupational therapist may be sought because they are trained in evaluating people with physical impairments and helping them build skills to improve their health and well-being. SURGICAL TREATMENTS One of the most common surgical procedures in the United States is carpal tunnel release. This is generally recommended if carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms last for 6 months. The surgery involves severing the band of tissue around the wrist to reduce pressure on the median nerve. The following are types of carpal tunnel release surgery: Open release surgery, is the traditional procedure used to correct carpal tunnel syndrome. This consists of making an incision up to 2 inches in the wrist and then cutting the carpal ligament to enlarge the carpal tunnel. Endoscopic surgery is far less traumatic and allows for faster functional recovery and less postoperative discomfort than traditional open release surgery. Either two or one (double portal or single portal carpal tunnel surgery, respectively) tiny incisions are made in the wrist and palm. A camera and surgical instruments are inserted in the incisions in order to cut the carpal ligament. Full recovery from carpal tunnel surgery can take days to months, although symptoms may be relieved immediately afterward. Additional results in some patients may be infection, nerve damage, stiffness, and pain at the scar. Occasionally the wrist loses strength because the carpal ligament is cut. Recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome following treatment is not uncommon. However, the majority of patients recover completely..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

I 've tried wearing a brace and it does feel better the next day. I did have an injury about 10 years ago (nothing was broken) but I 'm not sure if that has anything to do with this.

I do n't know what the symptoms of carpal tunnel are and was getting nervous, because I just started school to become a transcriptionist. It 's a relief that this does n't sound like any of your symptoms! Thanks again!######Found this that might help ``Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or itching numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers. Some carpal tunnel sufferers say their fingers feel useless and swollen, even though little or no swelling is apparent. The symptoms often first appear in one or both hands during the night, since many people sleep with flexed wrists. A person with carpal tunnel syndrome may wake up feeling the need to ``shake out '' the hand or wrist. As symptoms worsen, people might feel tingling during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. In chronic and/or untreated cases, the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. Some people are unable to tell between hot and cold by touch. ''######Thank you for passing that along! I have a couple of the symptoms (feels stiff and swollen, but do n't appear that way). I 'm assuming I 'd have to have more symptoms than that for it to be carpal tunnel.

Types of skin cancer there are three types of skin cancers: basal cell skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer and the dangerous malignant melanoma. Since skin cancer is very closely associated to skin pigmentation, the fair skinned people are more at risk of developing skin cancer as compared to the dark skinned ones. The cause of skin cancer prolonged contact with direct sunlight is what causes skin cancer. The main culprit in the direct rays of sunlight is the uv radiation (i.E. Ultra violet rays). Thus most of the preventive action against skin cancer is concentrated on avoidance of uv rays. Protection against skin cancer protection against skin cancer is probably easier than the protection against other types of skin cancer. Still, a number of people ignore it and become target of this dreaded disease. Here is a list of things that can protect you from skin cancer: 1. Clothing: since skin cancer is caused by prolonged contact of uv rays with your skin, the more you cover your skin with clothing, the lesser is your risk of developing skin cancer. Full sleeved clothes, long skirts and trousers, big hats/caps, high necks etc are all helpful in preventing skin cancer. 2. Sun screen lotion: there are a number of skin care products available in markets that offer effective protection against skin cancer. Sun screen lotions and creams that have a spf (sun protection factor) of 15 or more are much recommended for use. 3. Avoid exposure to uv rays: this is the best protection against skin cancer. If you can time your outdoor activity during those periods when the uv rays are less intense, you are automatically protected against uv rays. Thus getting out either early in the mornings of later in the evenings is the best. 4. Diet: carotenoid fruits and vegetables are also known to help prevent skin cancer. Detection of skin cancer the various techniques for protection against skin cancer can only reduce your risk of contacting skin cancer. If you are really unlucky (or if you have not taken the protective measures against skin cancer), you might still get affected by skin cancer.

His prognosis depends on what type of skin cancer he has. Does he have Basal Cell, Squamous Cell or Melanoma? Basal Cell is curable, Squamous Cell is a little more difficult to cure because it spreads but very slowly. The most dangerous form of skin cancer is melanoma but even that can be cured if found very early. If it has n't been found early and has become invasive the prognosis depends on what stage the cancer is at..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

Both of us are having them removed in the next couple of weeks. I understand carsonma's do not usually spread to other parts of the body so what is the difference between malignant and non maligninant. Do I have anything to worry about and will I have to have radiation or other treatments after surgury? I thought this was a skin cancer but my physician says he may have to go deep to get it all and it will probably leave a bad scar and then I have a 16% chance of getting anothre one later.######Where is your BCC located? I had BCC on the left side of my nose. I had Mohs surgery to remove it. My surgery was done at my Dermo's office. He had to go rather deep on mine, close to the bone, to remove it all and if you saw me today you would never ever know that I had had a thing done to my nose at all. You can do some reading on this site and you will probably find my post that explains it all. To answer your question on what is the difference between malignant and non-malignant, I do n't know. I, granted I am no Dr., assume any BCC is skin cancer... are you sure melanoma was never mentioned, there are different types of cancer, Basal Cell being the most common AND the most curable AND the most easily treated, Squamous Cell is next, and then melanoma. Make sure you find out exactly what kind you have. If you have any questions on my Mohs surgery please feel free to ask. You may want to also google ``Mohs '', try not be frightened by the pictures though as I was. Even though mine was very very deep, like I said it is virtually invisible now. Good luck to you and please keep us posted on what you have done.######Thanks... I have made my appointment for tomorrow to have it removed..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I have a fair complexion and do not stay out in the sun. But I have had skin cancer before, years ago. I think this is the third time I have gotten it. My skin cancer is pink colored and perhaps a little flaky. It 's only a small one of about 3/16 '' round shaped and is on my forearm. I have read that there are basically three types of skin cancer. But there are other names under those three common types. According to what I saw from looking at various pictures of skin cancers, it looks like actinic keratoses. But a description of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) sounds like that could also be a possibility. But mine is real light colored and looks pinkish like the photo I saw of actinic keratoses. I hate to go to doctors and I think this can be treated with drugs since I have used them in the past for skin cancer. I do n't remember the name of the med I used then. It was prescription. I think it was like a white cream that you just rub into the skin. Has anyone used any natural remedies? Not sure if I would depend on something natural like. Maybe my primary care physician can identify it and give me a script, but I would rather avoid seeing a doctor unless it is absolutely necessary. Thanks. Bluehills######You may wish to go to the doctor. You did n't mention what kind of skin cancer you had in the past. In general, there is Basal Cell (harmless) Squamous Cell (can be fatal) Melanoma (always fatal if ignored). There is a rare pink skin cancer, Amelanotic Melanoma that is usually more agressive than the standard darker Melanoma. Efudex 5 &#37; is by rx and is a chemotherapy cream that has been shown to help with small basal cell or squamous cell or residual cancer cells after excission.######djoyv I remember a skin cancer I had probably 15-20 years ago that was about a half inch round, very crusty and it would bleed ocassionally. But I do n't remember the exact name of it. The doctor back then actually cut the thing off my arm. Maybe old technic these days. My second skin cancer I used a cream on it. And I bet it was Efudex 5%. Since I 'm not a doctor it would be premature for me to say it is actinic keratoses, but the pic I saw of it looks exactly like it in early stage. I have a few freckles on my arm and it almost looks like a big freckle but more pinkish in color. It 's almost hard to see really. Thanks for mentioning the Efudex 5% to me. For now I am not in any hurry to have anything done with it. I 'll be keeping an eye on it though to see if it changes in any way. I know some skin cancer can kill. I do see a doctor in 3 weeks. I might have them take a look at it. Thanks..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

My questions is how serious is this, what is the prognosis, etc.. Should I try to persuade him to seek help from a dermatologist outside of the VA hospital? Any info would be appreciated and thanks...######Melanoma is a more serious type of cancer than the more common skin cancers, basal cell cancer or squamous cell cancer, which begin in the basal or squamous cells of the epidermis. Melanoma can spread (metastasize) quickly to other parts of the body through the lymph system or through the blood. Once melanoma is found, more tests should be done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. This is called staging. A doctor needs to know the stage of the disease to plan treatment. He should be seen by an oncologist (cancer specialist).######(url = ``http://www.mpip.org '' ]www.mpip.org (/ url) is a great informational website about melanoma.

A fibrous papule, flesh colored papule that usually appears on or around the nose, but can be found on other parts of the face, too, can mimic basal cell carcinoma. Seborrheic keratosis is very common growth, related to age (appears after 30's) and can be confused with moles. This lesion can change color, size, shape very quickly and thats why mimic melanoma (the most malignant skin cancer).

Diabetes is a disease wherein the body fails to manufacture or properly use insulin.Insulin is an agent of the blood sugars that is used as a source of energy throughout the body.Although the liver uses insulin for the storage of glycogen, a processed form of glucose. In a person with Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin that is produced does not work properly, and the sugars are not able to get into some of the cells.######There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is sometimes called insulin-dependent, immune-mediated or juvenile-onset diabetes. It is caused by an auto-immune reaction where the bodyâ$ s defence system attacks the insulin-producing cells. The reason why this occurs is not fully understood. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually occurs in children or young adults. People with this form of diabetes need injections of insulin every day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood. If people with type 1 diabetes do not have access to insulin, they die. Type 2 diabetes is sometimes called non-insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes do not usually require injections of insulin. Usually, they can control the glucose in their blood by watching their diet, taking regular exercise, oral medication, and possibly insulin. Type 2 diabetes is most common in people older than 45 who are overweight. However, as a consequence of increased obesity among the young, it is becoming more common in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes. If people with type 2 diabetes are not diagnosed and treated, they can develop serious complications, which can result in an early death. Worldwide, many millions of people have type 2 diabetes without even knowing it. Others do not have access to adequate medical care. The onset of type 2 diabetes is also linked to genetic factors but obesity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet increase the risks. Some women develop a third, usually temporary, type of diabetes called â$ gestational diabetesâ$ when they are pregnant. Gestational diabetes develops in 2-5% of all pregnancies, but usually disappears when the pregnancy is over. Women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on. For more information please check http://www.fenfuro.com/about-diabetes.html######I am also suffering from Type 2 diabetes. It is really very hard to live with diabetes. Many times people are get depressed. But weight loss is one of the very good way to control diabetes..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes
471	57	5c62324ac061d6b8ea5add2d	http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic104.html	1	Diabetes Q&A.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes######What Is Diabetes? Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes.######What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Points to Remember What is diabetes? a disorder of metabolism-- the way the body digests food for energy and growth What are the main types of diabetes? type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes gestational diabetes What is the impact of diabetes? affects 17 million people is a leading cause of death and disability costs$ 132 billion per year Who gets diabetes? people of any age people with a family history of diabetes most common in older people, overweight and sedentary people, African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Where Is More Information Available?

Just found out that my two sisters have diabetes, and hoping I do n't. Can someone tell me what your first symptoms were of diabetes. My sister said that she would get hot and sweaty and could n't lose weight.######Hot, sweaty, and not able to lose weight are not symptoms of diabetes. Weight loss, palore, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue are symptoms.######Okay thanks, I thought that not being able to lose weight was not one of the symptoms.######Lady50, I read in a Diabetes journal that there is a connection between Diabetes and NOT being able to lose weight. I know for myself, I tried different approaches to losing weight but did n't get results. Since recently being told I 'm Diabetic I started to watch my carb intake and carb mixtures for the past month to have control of my sugar numbers and already seen a reduction in my weight. It may be more of eating a healthier low carb diet but I also think since my sugar is at a steady pace- it 's easier for me to get the weight off. \* I also do get hot and sweaty but I 'm 46- that 's just plain ol' mother nature. PollyAnn######The not being able to lose weight may be what causes Type 2, but it is definitely not a symptom of diabetes. When you have diabetes, you are n't able to properly use carbohydrates for energy, so you urinate them out. This basically results in your peeing out your number 1 energy source, forcing your body to burn fat rapidly. Therefore, weight loss is a symptom.######Thats not exactly it but close. The Problem comes from No Insulin. Type 1 Diabetics will ofton see the weight loss but Type2's usually wont. When there is not any insulin in the body at all the body cant do many things, Insulin is responsible for Moving Glucos from the Blood stream to where it is needed. Which includes to Glycogen for energy and to fat for storage. Without any insulin the body also cant rebuild muscle as it gets broken up when used. So you end up losing tons of muscle. Unfortunately many Type 2 Diabetics actually do not experience any symptoms at all.######I visited a Diabetes Support group and the first thing I noticed was that everyone there was overweight. My thoughts were `is this the way I 'm heading with my Diabetes'. I have about 25lbs to lose but these people were a lot heavier. I went to gain knowledge from others that are in the same boat but at first I felt a little odd. Everyone was very nice, had different types of Diabetes and ranged in all ages. There was a 13-year-old girl who takes insulin and even she was overweight. Does insulin cause you to gain weight? I also learned from this group that most everyone has other serious issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure and lung problems. And the women in the late 40's age said they were dealing with Menopause symptoms and think possibly that Diabetes is making the symptoms worst for both their Diabetes and Menopause. It was n't the place for me but it 's nice that there are such place for support.######I agree type 2 diabetics do n't always show weight loss or any symptoms at all, but I do n't believe only people with type 1 experience weight loss. My pathophysiology text book lists weight loss as a symptoms for both types. Type 1s will lose more weight for the reasons you mentioned, but they will overall have more symptoms since their blood sugar will raise at a much more rapid pace. Once blood sugars reach over 180, most people will be peeing out glucose, since that is generally the renal threshold for glucose.######Thank you all so much. I have another question, hope ya all do n't mind. Right now I am like dead broke, and wanted to get a diabetes test since 2 sisters of mine have it. I was thinking of going to the local Health Department and get a finger \*\*\*\*\* blood sugar test. Do you think this test would detect diabetes in me. If your bloodsugar is quite high, does that mean diabetes. I have read that urinalysis is a good test, since there should be no sugar in the urine. This finger \*\*\*\*\* bloodtest will only cost me 3 bucks.######correction: should have said finger poke instead of the other word.LOLLOL######If both your sisters have it, I would think the easiest way to detect it would be asking one of them to test you. If it 's high, my suggestion to you is to get health insurance before you get diagnosed by a doctor.######It 's all very confusing to me. I thought Diabetes I was when your body ca n't produce insulin at ALL. that 's why it has to be injected. Type II diabetes is totally different and it 's not insulin that they 're taking by pill form. the medication they take by pill form helps regualte their blood sugar in type II. Insulin ca n't be produced in pill form. only with injection. type II can be cured by changing the diet. It 's proven. It 's very technical and can be down right confusing. hypoglycemia, vs reactive hypoglycemia is different from eachother too. I need a good book to describe and illistrate to me in detail what each one is. in laymans terms or dummy form like they make dummy books for computers. the longer I go with having low blood sugar attacks, the worst my being able to understand anything in an orderly fashion is diminishing. it 's very frustrating. maybe there 's a book out there in the market for me. anyone have any suggestions? Linda######There are several types of diabetes. type 1- the immune system attacks it 's own pancreas. This results in the insulin producing cells no longer being able to produce insulin. The blood glucose raises rapidly and dangerously. As no insulin is present, external insulin must be provided through injection or a pump. type 2- this is a bit more complicated. In type two, for some reason, the cells stop responding to the insulin being produced. Basically, insulin acts as the gatekeeper for the cells, allowing glucose to enter the body cells. Think of it as the gatekeeper falling asleep on the job. To make up for this, ``reinforcements '' are sent in. The body just keeps making more insulin so blood glucose can be maintained at a somewhat normal level, though the level does raise. Eventually, the body ca n't make any more insulin, so lack of insulin production becomes a sign of type 2 at some point in time. Gestational- basically in this one, the fetus takes all the glucose away from mom's body. So mom's body tries to not store glucose, but keep it all in the blood instead. The glucose raises. Also, some resistance is present due to the added weight. MODY- maturity onset diabetes of youth. This is a rare genetic form of diabetes. Basically, the body is born not being able to make enough insulin (but it makes some), and it gets worse with age. Diet and exercise can be used at first, then meds, then insulin. LADA- latent onset autoimmune diabetes of adults. Think of this as an adult getting Type 1. It 's a form of type 1 diabetes, but the onset is slower and at an older age.######update: My sister checked my bloodsugar with the finger poke bloodtester. Before I ate, it was 140, after eating it was 117. A few hours later, it dropped down to 57. This is when I was feeling a bit shakey inside.Then I was craving sweets like mad. This is weird that it dropped so low.######Sounds like reactive hypoglycemia.######Thank you for helping me with this. I will be looking that up..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes
474	57	5cc38c1ec061d64ea4994c8d	http://www.healthboards.com/boards/diabetes/585743-does-my-hubby-have-diabetes-please-help.html	1	Does my hubby have diabetes? Please help!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes######For the past few months my hubby has not been himself. He is tired all the time, and since mid December has been constantly thirsty. He ca n't get enough to drink. Several trips throughout the day to the bathroom, (but would n't that be from all the liquids he drinks?) His vision goes blurry, he gets very shakey, and sometimes he says he feels like he is going to pass out. No energy. While shopping last night I picked up a blood glucose test meter. We waited until this morning to do the test. He did n't have anything to eat or drink for 9 hours so we could get the proper results. The meter came up with ``510 ''. The test said if it is below 20 or higher then 600 a warning would appear letting him know it was too low or too high. We do n't know what a normal level should be. The test does n't really tell us. We did the test again about an hour after he ate lunch and it was ``471 ''. I did the test also to see what would happen and mine said ``80 '' in the morning and ``105 '' after lunch. He is 54 years old and NEVER been to a family Dr. because of not having any health insurance.Today I called all over to find a Dr. that will accept new patients without insurance. After 3 hrs. I found one who made an appt. but not until March 25. I even explained how worried I am about him. No one seemed to care. If he would of had insurance, they would have glady seen him. Can someone please tell us what a normal reading should be and your opinions on his symptoms? Thank you!######I do n't mean to scare you. But I would STRONGLY suggest you take your husband to a hospital emmergency room IMMEDIATELY. A lot of his other blood chemistries could also be out of whack and life threatening. It is possible that he may just get sent home with a prescription for glyburide, but please, you are better safe than sorry. These numbers are life threatening from what I understand. Please do not wait for the dr's appt. Go to the hospital. His numbers are extremely high. Anything above 126 is abnormal and these are life threatening values, again, from what I understand.######Normal is more in the range you saw on yourself, a bit higher would also be normal. In terms of symptoms, frequent urination is a symptom. I am not a Dr but my understanding is that where your blood sugar is too high, your kidneys try to dump some of the sugar out through urine. So you pee a lot. This dehydrates you and you are thirsty. I do n't know if you measured properly but if so, 510 and 471 would be very high. Can you continue looking for another doctor sooner? Is there not another medical service you can get help with?######I agree with Uma... your husband should go to the nearest emergency room. With blood sugars running that high, he could be in diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. While there, ask if he would qualify for uncompensated care (most hospitals have a fund to help take care of people who do n't have health insurance and are in financial straits but still need urgent medical care.) A non-diabetic's blood sugars would never go that high, even after eating a high-carb meal. Normal range is between 70 and 140, never higher. Your husband is definitely diabetic... question is, whether it 's type 1 or type 2, and the only way to tell is through some blood tests. Ruth######Yes, that would indicate diabetes, probably type 2, given his age, meaning he has resistance to his own insulin. He needs to see a doctor or go to the hospital asap to get his blood glucose in control. Normal blood glucose is between 70 and 120, so 520 is very high. Meters read ``HI '' when over 600, but that warning is just indicating extremely severe highs. Good luck, and do not let this slide so as to prevent any complications.######Finally talked hubby into going to the ER instead of waiting for Dr. appt. He does have type 2 diabetes. He did n't have any ketones which they said was a good thing. His glucose level while we were there was 296. They gave him a prescription for Metaformin. They set him up with a follow-up Dr. for this Thursday. I just want to thank e `one for telling me he should go to the ER. I was really scared for him. He 's been on the med. for 2 days but his numbers are still in the 200's. Anyone have any idea how long this med. takes to start working? Thank you all again!######Everyone is different but met can take weeks to kick in full effect. If I remember well they said as much as 4 to 6 weeks. When I started it was n't doing anything and I read it COULD take several weeks. It will slowly start to make a difference. Was it his morning levels that were so bad or after eating? In the mean time, go easy on the carbs and drink lots of water.######Not really sure if he is overweight, but probably is. . He is 6 ' 1 '' and weighs 255 pounds He 's gained 25 pounds since Sept' 07. Thats when he quit smoking (cold turkey) and took up eating candy. . tons of it! Around Nov./ Dec. is when he started feeling really bad. . (But since not feeling well he 's been losing weight) The ER did n't give us a diet plan or anything to follow before his Dr. appt. on Thursday, so I had to go online and look it up. I know the med. is making him even more sicker to his stomach, cramps, and diarrhea. I guess thats a normal side effect from what I have read about it and just to stick with it because you will feel worse before you get better ??? His reading this morning before breakfast was 189, the lowest it 's been since we started monitoring it a few days ago. Exercise. . yes, my hubby wants the both of us to start going for walks. We will ask the Dr. about it first. He 's a bricklayer and ca n't wait for spring to settle in so he can return to work. But mostly, all he keeps saying is. . ``I hope I get better ''. He 's very worried about not having insurance and not being able to work if he does n't get feeling better. Hopefully things will work out somehow.######If he is in fact Type2, the metformin will start having an effect after about 3 weeks. But if he is Type1, metformin wo n't do him any good and he will steadily get worse. The fact that the onset has been so quick, blood sugars of 500 + have been recorded, and he has lost weight suggest that it could be Type1. So watch it carefully.######He was diagnosed with type 2.######Sheila, From what I have heard and read, the side effects from metformin do go away after a while, but if they become intolerable, the best way to manage is to start from the beginning, with a very small dose, and then increase it gradually over a period of several weeks. Do n't know how much he 's taking, so ca n't tell if he 's on a large dose already or not. This is something you can work out with his doctor. Ruth######Thank you Ruth. He is on 500mg, 3 times a day.######There are people who 's pancreas produces no insulin. They are type 1. There are people who produce insulin but their body does n't use it well. They are type 2. And there are people in between who do n't produce quite enough or who 's body barely make due with what they produce. There are people borderline between the two. The progression of one to another sometimes occurs with age Doctors will try and use metformin and if your husband does n't get good control, they will try other medications and may eventually prescribe the use of insulin. Metformin is usually the first attempt. If it does n't work, there are several other weapons in the arsenal. I guess theoretically the minute you use insulin you are type 1. NIDDM is ``non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus '' (type2). IDDM is ``insulin depenant diabetes mellitus '' (type 1). I does n't really matter if he is type 1 or 2. The important thing is for him to get control, and if to do so, means insulin injections, so be it. They are not the end of the world, just think of them as a different form of medication. But for now, listen to the Dr. Metformin does a couple of things. I allows the insulin your husband has (assuming he is producing some) more efficiently. It also reduces the amount of sugar his liver produces. If he is responding to metformin, the chances are he does have some insulin production left. If it 's enough is to be determined. But remember, if not, insulin injections are not the end of the world. I hope this info helps. If it 's just annoying, let me know######I feel the need to correct a misconception here. Type1 Diabetes and Type2 Diabetes are clinically diseases and need to be treated in different ways. Type1 is an autoimmune disorder, whereas Type2 is the result of insulin resistance. While you ca n't progress from the one to the other, it is possible to have both Type1 and Type2 at the same time. The problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between them in the early stages, and Type 1 is often mis-diagnosed as Type 2. If the diagnosis was not based on insulin level and antibody test results, it could be wrong. As I mentioned in the previous post, normal weight, weight loss and very high blood glucose readings suggest that this could be the case. The fact there were no ketones could just mean that the pancreas is still producing enough insulin to stop this from happening. But things change fast in the onset of T1. And treating Type1 with type2 oral medications accelerates onset of the disease. Most importantly, these medications wo n't stop the development of ketoacidosis, which is dangerous condition. This is why it needs to be watched carefully at this stage.######Could n't have said it better myself, Mark! Also, even if T2 progresses to the point where one is insulin-dependent (as I am), it is STILL T2, not T1. It 's just T2 with a completely worn-out pancreas. Ruth######Unfortunately not all doctors and litterature use the terms the way you do. Some refer to type 1 as insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 as non insulin dependent (NIDDM). They seem to classify the result, i.e ``do I need insulin ''. You have classified them, as some doctors and litterature by the underlying issue, ie deterioration of the beta cells in the pancreas vs deterioration of the bodies ability to use insulin, that may lean to a burn out of insulin production. In your language, is IDDM type 1 and NIDDM type 2 or are those terms meaningless?######No, Type1 is not equal to IDDM and Type2 is not equal to NIDDM. And yes, it is unfortunate that the terminology has become so confusing. I think it highlights the shortcomings of defining a disease by its symptomatic characteristics. It makes much more sense to define a disease in terms of what causes it. But up until the 1970's, the distinction between the respective causes of what we now know as Type1 and Type2 diabetes were not well understood. So it was easier to call them IDDM and NIDDM. The terms Juvenile Onset Diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes were used for similar reasons. Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years. It is not uncommon for young people to become insulin resistant and for older people to have an autoimmune attack on their beta cells. It is also common for someone with insulin resistance to lose all beta cell function and become totally dependent on injected insulin (like Ruth). Also consider that an insulin dependent T2 is not the same as a T1 (who is also insulin dependent). The presence of insulin resistance means that additional treatment options may have to be considered. The net effect is that those old terms have lost their descriptive exclusivity. This is why usage of the IDDM/NIDDM and Juvenile/Maturity Onset Diabetes terminology has been superseded by ``Type1 '' and ``Type2 '' diabetes. These terms are both well understood in terms of the respective etiology, and the risk of mis-diagnosis has been brought into focus. This is what I was commenting on in the earlier post. It is easy to misdiagnose a T1 as T2 in the early stages. Doctors still use age and size as diagnostic guidelines and do n't do the required tests. Use of the old terms, IMO, is not helpful and just causes a lot of confusion. Mark######To highlight the lack of clarity, this from the definition page of the canadian diabetes association. (url) http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/dictionary.asp[/url] TYPE 1 DIABETES (or insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas no longer produces any or very little insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar as an energy source. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and affects 10% of people with diabetes. TYPE 2 DIABETES (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs or the insulin is not metabolized effectively. Type 2 usually occurs later in life and affects 90% of people with diabetes..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With Type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes may include fatigue, thirst, weight loss, blurred vision and frequent urination. Some people have no symptoms. A blood test can show if you have diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.######Great! So, do you recommend standard medications (drugs)?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

Thanks######If your brother has Type 1 diabetes, the only treatment is to use insulin, either with syringes (shots) or through an insulin pump. There currently is no permanent cure except a pancreas transplant, and they usually do n't do those unless the kidneys are also failing. If your brother has Type 2 diabetes, then it would be treated initially with diet, exercise and possibly oral medication. If he 's overweight and loses most of the excess weight, he then might not need any medication at all. But if he IS Type 2, it 's important that he not delay in treating it, as the blood sugar must be stabilized as soon as possible while he is attempting to lose the excess weight. I 'm assuming that it 's more likely that he 's a Type 1. A regimen of a shot of long-acting insulin taken once a day, coupled with rapid-acting insulin taken before eating and geared to the amount of carbs he will be eating, is the best way to control Type 1.

Cells use the hormone insulin, made in the pancreas, to help them process blood glucose into energy. If the above process takes place successfully, then there is no problem at all, but when muscles, liver, and fat do not use insulin properly. or, the pancreas can not make enough insulin for the bodyâ$ s needs. As a result, the amount of glucose in the blood increases while the cells are starved of energy. The normal range of blood glucose are: Fasting: 70-110 mg/dL After 2 hours of taking food: 110-150 mg/dL When the results exceeds the above maximum limits, you should take care of diabetes. There are three types of diabetes: 1. Type 1 Diabetes:- Type 1 diabetes are called insulin-dependent diabetes. In this form of diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the bodyâ$ s immune system has attacked and destroyed them. Taking insulin, regular exercise, controlling cholesterol and blood pressure are the treatments. 2. Type 2 Diabetes:- It is the most common form of diabetes. People can develop type 2 diabetes at any age. It is a condition in which fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin properly, or the pancreas not produces enough insulin. Treatment includes taking diabetes medicines, making wise food choices, exercising regularly, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol. 3. Gestational Diabetes:- Some women develop gestational diabetes late in pregnancy. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. PRE DIABETES Pre diabetes is a serious condition that can be described as the stage comes prior to type 2 diabetes, i.e blood glucose is higher than normal but lower than the diabetes range. Fasting: Normal â$ ``70-110 mg/dL Pre Diabetes â$ ``110-126 mg/dL Established Diabetes- > 126 mg/dL After 2 hours of taking food: Normal- 110-150 mg/dL Pre Diabetes â$ ``150-200 mg/dL Established Diabetes- > 200 mg/dL Having pre-diabetes also means you are at risk for getting type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However, you can reduce the risk of getting diabetes and even return to normal blood glucose levels with modest weight loss through healthy eating and moderate physical activity. If you are told you have pre-diabetes, have your blood glucose checked again in 1 to 2 years. The people at risk for type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay developing type 2 diabetes by losing a little weight. The results of many researches showed that weight loss through moderate diet changes and physical activity, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels can delay and prevent type 2 diabetes. Pre Diabetes Diet: When you are in a Pre Diabetes condition you need to have lots and lots of vegetables and fruits which are rich in fibers and are nutritious. Vegetables: Carrots, Spinach, Lettuce, Onion, Cucumber, Mushrooms, Cabbage, Cauliflower Tomatoes, Green and fresh beans, Broccoli, Beets, Lettuce, Okra Fruits: Apple, Oranges, Grapefruit, Lime, Peaches, Strawberries, Blueberries, Dried Apricots, Purines, Pears Sea Food and Meat in Pre Diabetic Diet You can have sea food and meat when you are suffering from pre diabetic conditions but you need to restrict the daily intake to a weekly basis and have to choose the options from the below given list. â$ cents Sea food may include fishes such as sardines, tilapia, tuna, haddock, cod, halibut, catfish herring, etc.. It can also include shellfish. â$ cents Poultry product may have egg, chicken, turkey, duck, etc. but all without skin. â$ cents Other meat may have beef, pork and lamb but they should be fat free. Grains and Legumes: Concentrate more on whole grains than on processed grains. Following list may help you with pre diabetic conditions. Oats, Bran, Brown Rice, Buckwheat, Cracked Wheat, Bulgur Wheat, Millet, Barley, Wild Rice, Popcorn, Amaranth, Quinoa, Rye, Flaxseed, Spelt, Wheat Berries By taking the precautions as listed above you can delay or prevent getting type 2 diabetesâ$ ¦######When at pre-diabetes stage, one should do a clinical test to see which organ is the predominant source of problem, the liver or the muscle/fat. Corresponding medications then can be used to specifically treat the problem organ. For example, if your problm is mainly the muscle, you may not need take any medicines or change diet but just do physical exercises to boost muscle insulin sensitivity. In theory at least, this should help you correct the problem better and stop the process of becoming type 2 diabetes. By the way, in your article you are talking World Health Organization values of normal glucose. By the ADA standards, the fasting glucose is up to 100 mg/dl and the 2 hour glucose is up to 140 mg/dl.######This post has been removed because it did not meet our Community Guidelines..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

Type 1 is an auto-immune disease and it 's basically the body attacking its own cells, destroying the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. It 's type 2 diabetes that is often associated with overweight people and unhealthy lifestyles. It does sound like you could have some symptoms of type 1. Dehydration, weight loss, frequent urination, excessive thirst... these are all signs of diabetes. The itchy, dry skin concerns me a bit. If you are dehydrated then you could end up with some stomach cramps and vomiting (assuming you are diabetic). Please, do go in very soon to see your doctor but, if for any reason, you start with stomach cramping or vomiting then go to the ER or call for an ambulance. If you are type 1 and your blood sugar keeps rising then you could end up with a condition called ketoacidosis and it 's life-threatening. Until you see the doctor, stay away from carbohydrates... they 'll only make your blood sugar go up even more. If you are diabetic then you can still have sweets. Type 1 diabetics inject insulin and you just take an amount of insulin to cover the amount of carbohydrates that you 're eating. If you eat a piece of cake, you just put more insulin in your syringe. It takes time to learn how to do everything but they have good educators to help you through it. You wo n't really have to worry about any diabetic diet. And injecting insulin is n't as bad as it sounds. Type 1's usually take multiple injections each day (4) but that gives them more freedom in what they eat. The needles are very thin and very small. The older method of injecting once or twice a day is n't used as much anymore, especially with more recently diagnosed people. Good luck and let us know how you make out.######I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) last week, and am going to my doctor tomorrow to discuss options. The reason I mention this is that I have done a lot of reading this weekend about hormones and the endocrine system, and if you were anorexic I 'm sure this has wreaked havoc on your hormones. In my case, lack of estrogen often causes lack of ovulation, menstruation, and it can also contribute to insulin resistence. I 'm tired all the time, I drink a lot/urinate a lot, I have had a recent problem with acne, and I get shaky if it 's been a few hours since I ate. If you are having diabetes-like symptoms, it 's probably because of a hormone imbalance resulting from your previous anorexia, which puts a huge strain on your body. But definitely discuss it with your doctor. And let us know what happens!######Most important thing is to go see your doctor and have him Test for diabetes. Linda is right about Type I. I have been Type I for 25 years. Taking Insulin Shots is no big deal at all. It definatley gives me more flexability with what I eat. Personally I think More Doctors should be Perscribing insulin to more type II diabetics. It like this phobia of Insulin... People Suffer altering their diet greatly and trying desprately to avoid having to take insulin.... But Why? Insulin is the BEST treatment for diabetes.... yet so many diabetic want to avoid it at all cost.######thanks for the replys! i 'm definitely going in to the doctor soon (calling to set up an appt. right now, actually), so i 'll let you all know what the outcome is. even though i realize i have a lot of the ``diabetic symptoms, '' i also realize it 's kind of vague and it could be a million other things, you know? i guess i was just feeling pretty worried and curious about what the lifestyle changes are. the insulin shot thing sounds a little freaky to me now, but i 'm sure i 'd get used to it if i had to do it. anyway, thanks and i 'll keep you posted..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I went to the diabetes center yesterday to get a monitor and have them show me how to use it. I 'm supposed to check my blood sugar levels 4 times a day: before breakfast and 2 hours after each meal. When I went in, it was three hours after I had eaten, but we took it anyway and recorded it like it had been 2. It was 109. Now, the guidelines she gave me says I do n't want it to be above 120 at the 2-hours-after mark. So 109 is pretty significantly lower (i think), but I did n't think much about it because it had been an extra hour. I took it again two hours after dinner, and it was 92. This morning it was 70. I do n't know what the morning number is supposed to be, but that still seems low to me. My fasting number, which is pretty much the same thing, when I took the glucose test was 96, and the nurse commented on how ``great '' that was because it was so low. But 70? Maybe I do n't know anything, but those numbers seem really low to me. I do n't want to call and be freaking out or anything until I have a full day of testing under my belt, but I was wondering if anybody here knew anything about it. How low is too low? Should I be concerned?######I just took my three hour long glucose test yesterday and im worried that it will come back bad. Pretty sure it will. I dont know if I can freaking prick my fingers like that... Ahhhh makes me queasy thinking about it. The dr said it can get so worse as to inject insulin too ??? I hope you find out your answers = 0 \############I dont know a week ago I took the hour long test, they took my blood I drank the nasty sprite stuff. . Waited an hour and they took my blood the test came back bad so I had to do the same thing but for three hours and they took my blood 4 times, once before and once every hour into the test up till the fourth hour. They didnt do that with you?######Yes, they did. But what i 'm saying is that when they prick your finger, they know within seconds what your sugar levels are. They should n't be making you wait to get the results; they knew the results when you were sitting right there. It 's not like they have to send bloodwork to a lab or something. Heck, I knew before the last prick on my three-hour test that I had failed it because I was already high on two of the numbers.######Oh I havent pricked my finger yet I just took the four hour test yesterday and they said if any two of them come back high I have gestational diabities which im pretty sure they will. I used to have highinsulin a few years ago when I was overweight so thats why the dr wanted to do this test early. Also every single time I eat I get tired and when I stand everything goes black. Something tells me its all connected. I should find out in a few days how the test came out and when I do she said that I have to come in and learn about all that pricking and stuff, see a dietition and some kind of group thing.######Yes, they have pricked your finger. If you did the glucose tolerance test, that 's what they do... Besides, you said they pricked your finger. Each time they prick your finger during that test, they are checking to see if your blood sugar levels are within a certain range. If it 's too high, then that 's bad. They would have known when they did the test if your levels were too high, there is nothing to ``wait '' on. Anyway... Someone * please * answer my question ?????######They took a tube of blood each time from my arm, the never pricked my finder. Hope you get your answer######That 's weird. Anyway, good luck to you. I 'm sure everything will be ok either way.######When I had my 1hr they pricked my finger... But when I had my three hour they drew 4 tubes of blood. I still go my results the next day. Didnt' need to worry abut it. When I had fainting spells they checked my blood and told me that I needed to make sure I ate something like an apple and drink a clear soda... It always made me feel better right away. They gave me the moniter too and as long as it was above 60 I was ok. But now I don; t have the spells anymore and I do n't have to prick my finger anymore.############My grandmother is diabetic and its disgusting now I know pregnancy induced diabetes is different and does go away 95% if you take care of urself this is what I do know some of it is from hubby... Carbs are really bad (basically they are spoons of sugar but come out later) taters, anything bread, carrots pretzels, chip etc naturals sugars you eat in halves so have half an apple in the morning the other in the afternoon just as an example. Make sure ur meals are complete 1/4 of ur plate should have stuff from every food group besides that ur about average for blood sugar 109 is quite high and 70 is kinda playing it on the average-normal side. Best of luck lalee just as an fyi for anyone if you have gestational diabete and do not take care of urself/eat healthy/moderation/diet it is very possible your diabetes may carry over past the pregnancy so take care of urself now! Hubby said its really gross when people come in with diabetes, it slowly kills you and your skin dies he said the smell can be somewhat bad now majority of people who have it did do it to theselves for not taking care of themseles unfortunatly there is people who never asked for it!############I had to sign up in order to respond to this post. I am a certified diabetes educator. The information that diamondsz provided is not only dangerous, but can be construed as prejudice advice to all with diabetes. Everything that diamondz said is wrong. 1) having diabetes is ``not disgusting. '' people who think it is do not even know what diabetes means. 2) gestational diabetes usually goes away, but a person with gestational diabetes is at risk for developing it again in future pregnancies, or type 1 diabetes (we 'll get to that). 3) carbs are not bad at all. Everything you eat consists of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You can not avoid carbohydrates, and in fact, probably consume 60% of them. There are many, many kinds of carbohydrates. I would get into that, but it would take weeks of writing to tell you about it. 4) spoon fulls of sugar is bad, like she said, but it is bad for everyone. Being diabetic does n't mean it 's bad. If you ever, ever say, ``oh my god, that person is diabetic, they ca n't be eating that (insert desert item here)! '' , you need to stick your foot in your mouth. Especially if you ca n't even tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All of the ``meal plan '' advice that has been provided by diamondz are just platitudes. It is impossible to do an armchair diagnosis of a person. Use this boards as support, not as medical advice. The fyi by diamondz is even more misleading. She claims that if you do n't take care of yourself now, then you 'll have diabetes later in life. This is not true. (we 'll get to that, too.) her ``hubby '' is wrong about diabetes, and it 's shameful that he be claimed to be an authority in this field. It 's all wrong, wrong, and wrong. Yes, uncontrolled diabetes leads to complications. Please note... Uncontrolled. This means different things to different types of diabetes. I wish diamondz did n't spread the common ``media belief '' of diabetes on this board. The following information is true: there are two major classifications of diabetes; type 1, and type 2. Of all the cases of diabetes in the world, between 5-10% of people in the world have type 1 diabetes; the remainder have type 2 diabetes. Of all the people who have type 2 in the world, there are over 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes. Four of the 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes are caused by lack of exercise, poor diet, and insulin resistance. This can sometimes be blamed on the person for not exercising or eating poorly-- in fact, most of the time, it is based on food. But some forms of type 2 diabetes are not the fault of the person. Hence, diamondz calling it ``gross '' is totally abusive in her ``authority. '' some people who have type 2 have gotten it because of cancer drugs (chemotherapy). So the next time you call a type 2 diabetic ``gross '', you 'd better have your facts straight-- they could be a five-time cancer survivor, and you 've just hurt their feelings for living. Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by diet, exercise, and sometimes oral medications called insulin sensitizers or incretin mimetics. Now, to the important type of diabetes-- type 1. Type 1 diabetes does not occur based on anyone's choice. It hits randomly. I said randomly. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction. Do you know anyone with ms? Lupus? Celiac disease? These are all autoimmune conditions. Type 1 diabetes can hit anyone-- at any time. It 's commonly called ``juvenile diabetes '' because it frequently occurs in younger people, but it can happen at any age. For every one-hundred diabetics that reads this message, five to ten of them have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 means their pancreas does not produce insulin, so it must be supplied through an insulin injection. So long as the person tests their blood glucose frequently, and adjusts for carbohydrate/fat/protein intake at meals, they can ``think like a pancreas '' and keep glucose values in normal ranges. This is not an easy job-- it is a full time job. This is a very complex subject, so i 've only touched the surface. There are basal insulins, bolus insulins, and a very complex world of diabetes management. If a person does not manage their blood glucose levels, they are more prone to diseases that affect small blood vessels (like retinopathy, kidney problems, neuropathy, and the list goes on). Please-- do not look at kids with type 1 and say they 're doomed. If they are in control of their diabetes, they live just as long. And with modern technology (e.G. Home blood glucose testing), complications of diabetes are reduced. Type 2 diabetes complications are of the same manner. These are the target populations that give type 1 diabetes a bad, bad name-- diamondz comments are evidence of this. I will respond to lalee's question in the following message.######Lalee, now to answer your question. Gestational diabetes is an interesting topic to me. It 's believed that in some women, insulin resistance causes the diabetic symptoms (it can be seen like type 2 diabetes), where in other cases, it models type 1 diabetes (where the mother's beta cells stop producing insulin in sufficient quantities). Home blood glucose meter kits have a +/ -20% error. This means that if you see 100mg/dl on the screen, it could be anywhere between 80 and 120 mg/dl. The purpose of the meter is tell a story of your trends. If you were showing 200 mg/dl on many occassions, this trend would be a flag about a problem. Showing 121 mg/dl does not mean you have diabetes... Even showing 140 mg/dl does not prove anything, because of the margin of error on the test kits. This fact should help to relax you a bit. Each of those tests costs$ 1.00, so it 's hard to experiment with the meter without costing a fortune. The average blood glucose level of humans, according to quest diagnostics statistics, is 85 mg/dl. This is a plasma level. This means that including post-meal, pre-meal, and fasting conditions, a person without diabetes averages, in their lifetime, 85 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose levels fall below 60 mg/dl. Some people may experience it, and simply eating a meal (or candy) can raise blood glucose back up. You might feel shakey, confused, tired, annoyed, scared, and even sweaty during hypoglycemia. This is because stress hormones turn on in the body in an attempt to raise blood glucose-- this hormone is called glucagon. When a type 1 diabetic takes too much insulin, or does too much exercise, their blood glucose can drop-- hence their need to chomp on fast acting carbohydrates (such as dextrose). Hyperglycemia is defined as the condtion when glucose is higher than 180 mg/dl. If you give even the healthiest person in the world a bunch of candy, they will rise above 120 mg/dl. The person training you probably was reading the brochure and standard training literature. And they probably do n't know that a meter has a +/ -20% error rate. (i actually see the one-touch ultra, and if you read the small print documentation, you 'll see this is the fact). Make sure your meter code is set for the test strips you 're using-- this can skew your results a bit when it does n't match the test strip vial. 70 mg/dl is normal for waking up. The values you have presented show no signs of hyperglycemia (diabetes). If you are ever worried about having low blood glucose, just eat. Typically, you will find yourself at a low glucose level in the mornings, since you have n't eaten much. If you get up and wait 30 minutes before testing, you 'll discover that your body (specifically, your liver) releases glucose to raise you in order to help you ``hunt for food. '' you have nothing to be concerned about. I 'm going to give one more lesson for any other readers out there. Why are we concerned with gestational diabetes? Well, here's why. Insulin is a hormone that turns glucose (sugar) into fat. That 's it. Yes, very simple. People who lack insulin can not turn glucose into fat, so their bodies ``starve to death ''-- people with type 1 diabetes before 1921 (the invention year of insulin) would die, despite whatever they ate. Type 2 diabetes is defined as insulin resistance-- meaing that their body has plenty of insulin, but for some reason, is not able to use it (i could speak for hours on this topic.) you have beta cells in your pancreas that release insulin in response to high glucose values. (this is why a type 1 takes insulin when they eat, or when they need to lower their hyperglycemia into normal glycemia, which is in the range of 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl). I 'm leaving out a lot of details here... But basically, here 's the problem. If your blood glucose goes really high, the baby will produce insulin in order to lower the blood glucose in its body. You see, you share what is in your body with the baby's body. If your blood glucose is high, the baby's blood glucose will be high, too. So what does the baby do? The baby's pancreas produces insulin to compensate. This insulin, though, does not travel out to the mother's body. Instead, it works to lower glucose in the baby. Read back to what I said that insulin does. It builds fat. Here's why gestational diabetes is a bad thing: 1) the baby will come out weighing 10 + pounds... Not exactly a thing you want going through you, right? 2) high blood glucose increases the chance of bacteria to set up shop, because glucose is the essential food for all life, including bacteria; 3) having high glucose in the mom can cause oxidative stress, meaning, the mom will feel yucky; 4) having high glucose in mom can result in mom's beta cells working too hard-- if they work too hard, they will become damaged, and the mom could potentially be left with type 1 diabetes, which can occur anywhere from one day after birth to... You guessted it... A risk lasting the rest of her life. Some women have 3 kids, and end up with type 1 diabetes. Sorry for all the lessons, but I really saw a lot of information that was way out of line in this thread. Diabetes should not and does not have a negative image associated with it, as diamondz was presenting. You should never define a person with diabetes as beign a ``diabetic '' in a social situation; would you call a person with cancer something like a ``that peson with cancer '' or a person confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis (ms) a ``multiple schleratic ''? I do n't think so. If you or anyone else has questions about diabetes, please feel free to contact me. Typos are the mistake of me writing this at 2 am. I hope this helps to lower your concerns. Also, I could go into the whole world of the glucose tollerance tests (gtt) that some of you have experienced, but I think this is more than enough information to digest for now. Btw, there are people who have ``hypoglycemia ''-- where they produce too much insulin, or become hypoglycemia after eating a high carbohydrate meal. (their body responds with insulin for the meal, but the insulin hangs around too long, causing cells to turn too much of that glucose into fat). Did you know that an average person has 6 grams of glucose in their blood? That 's why diabetes is so hard to manage... If you just add one extra gram of sugar in the body, it can raise glucose values by 40 mg/dl or even more (depending on weight). Okay, i 've said enough on this. I really hope diamondz takes back what she 's said about diabetes, and that she needs to have her husband, if he 's in the medical establishment, to stop telling her what he 's ``heard. '' by the way, a person's glucose can change by 300 mg/dlin as little as one hour. So do n't sweat the small changes. If you 're between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl while fasting, you 're doing great. Two hour post-meal (also called post-prandial) should be under 120 mg/dl, though some scientists believe 140 mg/dl is just as fine, so long as fasting levels return to below 100 mg/dl. These values are played with all the time, but since your home test kit is only correct within 40% of the actual value (+20% to -20%), you ca n't freak out. Now if you keep getting results that are high, or after eating, then you can be concerned a bit more. If you have more diabetes questions, I highly recommend going to the american diabetes association website (www.Diabetes.Org) and go to the message board, and post questions in the appropriate forum. You will have very well grounded and experienced people there that can assist you with your questions.######Weird, my capitalizations on certain words has been modified... For example, quest diagnostics is the name of a business, and should be with a capital ``q '' and a capital ``d '', but when I saved the message, it was placed in lower-case format. Needless to say, the above messages I posted are not how I wrote them. This forum must modify cases to their own non-english standard. -- oh, and one more thing... Labs do n't necessarily test with a glucose meter. For the person who had blood drawn into a tube at each hour, this is because they are sending the blood in for accurate tests. Their glucose meters are the same as the ones you can buy off the shelf. That means they still have that +/ -20% error. The blood they put in a tube, however, will be sent to a lab, spun on a centrafuge, and testsed. The margin of error for lab-tested blood is typically less than 2% (that means a 4 mg/dl error range), which is much, much, much, much more accurate than a home glucose meter.######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy

I have seen B12 deficiency referenced as a potential cause of such symptoms, alternative to Alzheimer's-- and I have seen at least one article in a prominent newspaper implicating such a deficiency in the dementia of one elderly patient-- however I have also read in a medical text that this explanation is a relic from the 1950s to which the medical community no longer subscribes. I was also told by one neurologist that in 25 years of practice, he never encountered an older patient whose dementia went away with the help of additional B12.

Her doctors had ruled it out because of her age, but now it 's official. She 's taking Aricept & is in line to visit Baylor College of Medicine in Houston as soon as they can see her. Fortunately she 's had no side effects from the medicine. All we do right now is cry some & get angry some. We realize what we 're facing in the future, but are at a loss on what to do right now. Does anyone have any suggestions on reading materials, activities or just some advice for us? All the information we 've found has been for the elderly & does n't really apply to my Mom. Thanks so much!######Reading material that is important in understanding the effects of and the care for a Alzheimer's patient. Therapeutic Caregiving: A Practical Guide for Caregivers of Person's with Alzheimer's and Other Dementia-Causing Diseases, this practical book is acclaimed by many Alzheimer's Association chapters, Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers, and caregivers world-wide. BY: Barbara J. Bridges, R.N., M.S.N., M.S.H.C.M., M.B.A.. The Best Friends Approach to Alzheimer's Care, by Virginia Bell, M.S.W., and David Troxel, M.P.H.. This book is the most instructive to date on the ``how to '' of relating to persons with dementing illness, and an excellent companion to Therapeutic Caregiving. The book that opened my eyes to what my mother was going through was: The John-Hopkins research paper (report) 1980, on the Disease of Alzheimer's and Dementia. (The Blue Book). This book was distributed to Social Services and other government agancies dealing with elder care in the 1980's -1990's. I do not know how to get a copy of this report, outside of contacting John-Hopkins University, Alzheimer's Medical Research Unit. Also: Please contact your local Alzheimer's support group. Basic care proceedures are the same reguardless of age of the patient. Alzheimer's is recently becomming an increasing problem with persons in their 40's and 50's. (A little known fact). And, there are family members that have started a spear-head movement to help assist families who 's normal bread-winner is now impaired, due to this awful disease. Alzheimer's not only effects the elderly on Social Security, but now is effecting familys in their earning years. In other-words, it not only effects the sandwitch generation as to elder care (caring for their parents with Alzheimer's or dementia and their own children and families at the same time); but, now, it can effect the families themselves. (People who are not only careing for their parents but also trying to raise their own children AND meanwhile they are dealing with a spouce with Alzheimer's or vascular dementia, or could even be suffering from one of those diseases themselves).

The person in question suffers from anxiety and has been prescribed ozaxepam -15 mg twice daily. Appears to have little effect on the anxiety. Would such a dose add to the person's mental confusion?######Yes, Serapax is for anxiety. 15 mg a twice a day fits into the usage for mild to moderate anxiety. It is a CNS (Central Nervous System) depressant. From what I have found there is no clinical evidence that age makes a different in this medication except that the dosage need to be started at a lower dosage than for other patients, and it appears that is what your doctor has done. These newer CNS depressants do have less side effect than the older benzos such as Ativan and Xanax which are not recommended for the elderly. But they are addictive and their effectiveness tends to decrease over time so that a higher dosage is needed to obtain the same effect. Also know that it takes several weeks (4 to 6 usually) to know the full effect of the medication. My Mom was finally put on Geodon which is NOT recommended for elderly dementia patients because of the slightly increased risk of stroke or heart attack associated with this medication in the elderly dementia patient. But after months of manic behavior and trying many other medications this seemed to be the one that worked for her. The level of her anxiety was such that she was miserable and the risk has been well worth the benefit for her. So you have to take a lot into consideration when deciding on a medication. Sadly there is not many clinical trial for the effectiveness of psychotic medications on elderly dementia patients. It 's a hit and miss, best guess, which is not always the best. But My best guess is that this was a good choice to try for your Mom at this time Make friends with your pharmacist. Doctor prescribe meds but it is the pharmacist that KNOWS the drugs, their effectiveness, the side effects, and the interactions. When it comes to medications I trust my pharmacist above and beyond the physician. They are the medication experts !!!! Love, deb.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Alzheimer's Disease & Dementia

At times, they wander about aimlessly, yell, start crying, or display emotions of combativeness and aggression. Sleep disturbances, inappropriate sexual behaviour, hallucinations and delusions are a part of life for these folks too. These persons are afflicted with Dementia. How do you understand dementia? What symptoms of dementia have you seen exhibited among our elders?######General Dementia are usually apparenent with older people and it starts off with very mild to moderate forgetfulness. Some stay in that categorie while other go a bit deeper into the desease into a much more fearfull forgetfulness. Forgeting occasions, events, things that happend yesterday and years ago. While on the other hand, slight short term dementia may just have occasional forgetfulness. Things like what they had for breakfast that morning or where they went yesterday. The slight stage normally the person is very aware that they can not remember as well relating to the present, where a worse case would not remember years ago which is what we call long term memory loss. Short term memory loss in the elderly is not uncommon at all.

Now he has alzheimer's I am just wondering if being sick all those years lead to this disease.######Depression and Alzheimer are caused by different malfunctions in the brain. Depression can have some of the same symptoms as Alzheimer. Someone with Alzheimer can have depression as well. Depression does not cause Alzheimer. I did see in my Mom, then when she realized she was showing signs of Alzheimer, that she became depressed. So Alzheimer can cause depression but not the other way around. Hope that helps... Welcome to the forum... Love, deb######I agree with Deb, but I also just scanned the internet for dementia and depression and found some interesting info. You might try that to find some answers to this question. When my DH was diagnosed I asked the neurologist for an anti-depressant to go along with his other meds to help him in the future. Unfortunately they go hand in hand... Good luck, Janie######OK then what about dementia? Can depression lead to dementia or is it the other way around? Is dementia the same as alzheimer's?######Dementia is a broad catagory that includes many types of cognitive decline. Alzheimer is just one of the many types of dementia. Vascular dementia and picks are two other types of dementia. Depression does not cause dementia. People who are depressed can have some of the same symptoms as those with dementia. Because of their withdrawal they can have behavior changes, difficulty focusing, memory problem etc but the root case is the depression. The correct medication for depression will improve these symptoms. In dementia the symptoms are not improved by depression medication. Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain where as dementia is caused by an inability of the synaps of the nerves to function correctly. As I said before people who have dementia (alzheimer being one type of dementia) may (and often do) develop depression but depression does not cause dementia. It might help to do a web search on depression, dementia, and alzheimer as Janie suggested. Good luck and I hope this helped. Love, deb######It would be very helpful for you to have a talk with your family member's doctor. Could you go with him/her to a regular checkup? If it is your parent, do you have medical POA so you can be included in decision making? There are also many books on Alzheimer's Disease, as well as Internet information. My mother had dementia and died of it last winter. She was never depressed, but for a short time (months) was upset because she did n't know what was happening to her. That time went by, and then she was content again, not remembering what she had lost. Good luck! Martha############From reading these responses, it seems that it is the alzheimer's that leads to dementia. I am going to have to do some research on these. Thanks everyone!############Ibake is right- in fact the two terms are so close that they are often used interchangeably. My Mom had `old age dementia ' or `senile dementia ' but to all intents and purposes she was treated exactly like an Alzheimer patient. Many people ask, at the beginning of their caregiving, '' is this Alzheimer's or only dementia? '' I did also. It is a common error, caused by both terms being used for the same symptoms, and because of the fear and anxiety caused by the word '' Alzheimer, '' it is sometimes avoided by people- also doctors- saying ``dementia '' instead. Keep researching and learning, It is good to know what to expect. love, Martha######People are using ALZ and dementia interchangeably and that is WRONG. ALZ is the most common FORM of dementia. There are many other types. Unfortunately. 1. has a specific genetic component and is caused by the failure of the brain to use certain chemicals for memory and other necessary functions. Acetycholine is one of the chemicals that the ALZ brain does not seem to have enough of. You can find this out for yourself on the web. 2. is the second leading cause of dementia in the elderly. It is caused by multi-infarcts or strokes-- sometimes so small as to go unnoticeable. but it causes many things that ALZ causes Also there are no meds for this condition like there are for ALZ. That is why you know which type of dementia your family member has. An early diagnosis of ALZ can be slowed by the ALZ meds. 3. An MRI can see the damage due to strokes. This is vascular dementia. I am pretty sure you can not see the plaques and squiggles caused by ALZ but can be seen during an autopsy. My mother's MRI showed the scar tissue due to strokes. The doc said he did n't think it was ALZ. Therefore, we were told it was either Vasc Dementia or Atypical Progressive Dementia. Whatever. She has many symptoms that an ALZ patient has without the physical changes that occur with ALZ. 5. Old age senility is another category that seems to be fairly innocuous. It is simply put-- the natural aging of the brain and we all know people in their 80s and 90s who can still live alone and function but family members are constantly checking in. This used to be called ``hardening of the arteries ''. the blood simply was n't getting to all the parts of the brain anymore. these old people may even still be driving, (they should n't) and are not in the true dementia group and yet they are no longer able to function as they did at 50-60-70... Most of us, if we live long enough, will be in this latter group# 5... I hope this helps.######You are right Golfhat. Even doctor's interchange the terms. My Dad was diagnosed with ALZ when in fact he has Vascular Dementia. He was put on Aricept and Namenda though neither are for his type of dementia. All because he was misdiagnosed. Mom has been diagnosed correctly with dementia consistent with ALZ. The research facility she was diagnosed at does not just call it ALZ because it can not be definitely diagnosed unless there is an autopsy. I have noticed a different progression in Mom's ALZ. Dad's progression has been sporatic by steps rather than the steady progression that Mom has experienced. Dad still maintains some of his logical and Mom has lost hers. Dad processes auditory much better than Mom. Having one of each I do see differences. I just wish medical professionals were as current on the disease as some caregivers are. Love, deb######Old age Dementia (used to be called senility) can also be totally devastating. That 's what my Mom had, and she became just as strange and irrational as an Alzheimer victim. Everything from not bathing to wandering off, to night activity (sundowning) to burning pots, and not knowing who people are. I dont think it is inevitable. You see people on TV who are 105 and rational, clear thinking. They may need help getting out of a chair, but do not have to be told to take a bath... Comparing Mom to other patients at the NH where she wound up after the hip fracture, she was more docile than some, more cheerful and optimistic than most, but just as confused, incapable of rational thought, and blank eyed as all the rest. I think any form of dementia is terrible, and I am glad that not all of us who live long will get it... Love, Martha######After reading your post Martha a question that I have ask myself several times came to mind. The inability to supress impulses and to control behavior can frequently be effected by dementia. I have often wondered how much of what you see in dementia patients is a result of this center being effected and a basic personality of the person involved. That personality which was always there but was intentionally repressed. Mom has turned into her mother and I see all the old resentments and anger that she never expressed before coming forward where as my Dad is accepting, kind, and cooperative unless provoked. He does display the paranoia of the soldier side of him and the dominance of the men of his age. These reactions are all scewed by their inability to process their current reality but the idea does interest me. Just an observation I have made over the years. Love, deb############Oh No! (just Kidding. . sorta)######Honestly Ibake... I do n't care how down I get I can depend on you for a smile that spread from ear to ear. You have the most amazing sense of humor !!! I can tell you that when I looke in the mirror I want to say.... Then I will be happy Thanks for the smile, I needed it... Love, Deb PS... Meg... no sorta in my books######Heck, no for me either. .

I 'm 21 and have had Crohns Disease for 7 years and been taking Remicade ever since every 6 weeks and never had a problem. But lately I 've been having flu like symptoms and both legs hurt really bad from hip to my ankles it almost feels like I just got done running a marathon. Also my arms feel the same way. I do n't know if it could be from the Remicade that 's making me sick or if its something else? But after reading a bunch of posts on here it seems like I 'm not the only one with these types of symptoms. If anyon has any suggestions please let me know. Thank you######Hi I 've had Crohns for 23 yrs with fistulas for the last 4. I tried Remicade when I first got the fistulas, it worked really well for about 5 treatments then I started to feel really unwell for days afterwards. It got to the stage that by the time I felt ok, it was nearly time to start the whole process again. About to start Humira next week. I also got leg pains but this possibly due to the doctors finding I was very aneamic as a blood transfusion stopped that pain right away. hope any of this helps..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Crohn Disease

I was lucky enough to have my parents get me on a insurance that covers my medical bills 100%, but, as of lately the topic of insurance has been coming up because my 18th birthday is closing in, rapidly. After I 'm 18, I could very well not have anymore insurance, but even if they do extend it, it will only be until I 'm 19. If any of you know about Crohns disease, you may know that it is a nice costly thing to have. I get Remicade infusions aprox every 8 to 10 weeks. (From what I have been told, they cost$ 20,000 each time.) Even if I do get put on my Mom's insurance it only covers 80% of that. (Mind you, this is not even including my other medications!) 80% of$ 20,000 is still$ 4,000, which to me is quite a lot! So... Say I get a remicade every 10 weeks... thats. . aproximately 5 a year. 5 times 4 is 20, so thats$ 20,000 a year, even with insurance that covers 80% of medical. (Again, not including perscriptions.) Plus, I am sure I will be attending college, and ``WILL '' have a job (not like I have any other choice there?) Pretty much, I am looking for suggestions on what I can do? It 's very frustrating, especially since I originally wanted to move away, but as it stands, seems I wo n't be getting any where fast with these amounts of medical bills. Help please!######is there an alternative medication, or is that the best one? The university supplies health insurance for its students, so you should be fine there. I 'm not sure what their policy is for pre-existing conditions. Another option is health insurance through an employer.######Taura, Remicade is a costly drug, indeed, but not as costly as you think. As a member of the news media, I write about drug companies, so I have some background in this. The cost of Remicade is more like$ 20,000 a year (or$ 4,000 a year for you out of pocket if you 're covered 80% by insurance). It 's not$ 20,000 per treatment. This is still a lot of money, I understand. I hope you can get insurance through your college.######Thanks for your input danimal15, I completely did not know that! That at least is a relief, but still costly. chiggins1066, I believe remicade was my last option, so, no..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

It was an almost immediate decision from the doctor I switched to after the prior doctor's only suggestion was to up my prednisone intake to ridiculous levels (I told him off and switched to a specialist obviously) Now I 'm about five infusions in and it seemed to work great the last few times, but it also seems to work less each time. That might be a question for another time because I 'm positive my symptoms would lessen if I, at the very least quit smoking (do n't berate me for that, I 've heard it enough) My main concern is whether or not the Remicade is worth it. My doctor opted not to try any other treatments first so all I 've had is Remicade and Prednisone and now I 'm not taking Prednisone either but I 'm wondering what other option I 'd have any way? On top of that, since I started taking the infusions, I 've had a terrible case of Bronchitis, three suspicious boil type things on my legs (all on separate occasions) that would n't go away without antibiotics, an awful case of the flu and an awesome case of MRSA (the antibiotic resistant one). This is all in a span of maybe five months and all of these random ailments took much more than a week or two to clear up. My question now is, does anyone have to deal with the same crap on Remicade, how do I avoid it without seriously disrupting my life (ie: Bubble Boy) and is it really worth it to be incapacitated with some kind of sickness two weeks out of every month? Should that really be happening or should I talk to my doctor? At this point, it 's like a similar, slightly less painful version of lying in bed while flaring for months on end.######Here are some excellent resources on eHealthForum which may help you: Antibiotics to treat chlamydia Quit Smoking: How long before I notice the positive impact o Antibiotic-resistant Staph Now a Major Threat Antibiotics to treat chlamydia Quit Smoking Nicotine and the Humphrey Bogart Gene Crohns disease.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Crohn Disease

You may not even have heard of Crohn's disease until now. And even if you are familiar with the disorder, the information you have may be pretty limited. That 's all about to change. Clearly, you will have many questions about how this disease will affect you-- both now and down the road. For example, you 'll want to know: Will I be able to work, travel, and exercise? Should I be on a special diet? How will other people react to my illness? Could my medications have side effects? How will Crohn's disease change my life? Learning all you can is an important step toward taking charge of your illness-- and your life. The following is an overview of Crohn's disease. It is designed to help you understand more about the diagnosis and treatment of this illness, and its impact on the day-to-day lives of patients and their families.

Did you mean to say you have HYPOtension? The only thing I 've seen mentioned about fainting and low blood pressure is a situation where a person with low blood pressure has been sitting/squatting for a long period of time and suddenly stands. You can lessen the possiblility of fainting by getting up and stretching or walking every few minutes if you 're going to be seated for a while. Also, rising slowly and giving your body a chance to adjust to the new bloodflow will help. Standing causes a sudden drop in blood pressure because the blood goes to the lower extremities. This happens for all people. In those with normal or high BP, the body sends a signal for the heart to pump faster... to compensate for the change in blood flow. For people with low BP, the body does n't send this signal and fainting can occur..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Low Blood Pressure and Hypotension

I have never actually fainted in my life and usually the feeling goes away when I stop walking, stand there for a few seconds and I 'm good to go. But it 's frustrating going through this all the time, and I may end up fainting in the future, who knows. Sometimes just the simple act of picking up something off the ground makes me feel lightheaded. Is this normal? some websites say it 's normal for people with low BP to have these symptoms. Other websites say people who have naturally low BP do not show any symptoms and this only happens to people who have higher BPs that drop suddenly. But I 've always had low BP. I experienced greyout once about 5 years ago (saw everything in black and white only), had to lay down. What do you think? should I be worried or do you all have these problems as well?######Feeling dizzy is associated with low BP so it 's quite normal.

Most likely you may have fainted due a vasovagal attack, which commonly occurs in extremely emotional or psychological situations. People with panic attacks, eating disorders (which can result in low glucose levels) are more likely to have such episodes. In case, you gained consciousness within minutes of the episode, and did not have any major persisting issues, you need not be worried about it anymore. But if the loss of consciousness lasted for more than 15 minutes, and you have any form of neurological defecits (seizures, weakness, sensory defects, headache, nausea, vomiting, etc) you should consult with your doctor for a examination, a few tests and proper treatment of the underlying cause..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Low Blood Pressure and Hypotension

Late last year Amlodipine 10mg was added to the regime. I immediately lost energy, gained weight and developed abdominal pains which eventually became constipation. I have weaned myself slowly back to 2.5 mg and hope things eventually correct themselves. My GP admitts that Amlodipine can cause constipation in some people and my pharmacist agrees. If that is so I want off this medication. It 's getting me depressed and down. I would rather have slightly increased BP. Does this CCB affect others?######Your not alone. My husband takes Metoprolol... Losartan and Amlodipine for stubborn BP as well. Yes he also gets constipated for a day or two but takes a Probiotic 3 times a week which has regulated his system. Usually the Probiotic is mostly for Diarrhea but it does help him with the constipation. We make sure we take a Probiotic Acidophilus which both our Cardio and PCP recommended, so far... so good. I have the opposite problem of frequent Diarrhea so it really works for both. Best of wishes... JJ...######Sometimes it 's an interraction or a combination of all the drugs. Amlodipine is notorious for causing ankle and leg swelling (edema). I believe their are definitely better calcium blockers. I think Diliatazem or Verapamil supposed to be more effective with less side effects. Maybe the Candesartan or Metoprolol dosage can be increased and you can eliminate the Amlodipine. Candesartan and Metoprolol are very good drugs. I believe the Doxazosin is also used for prostate conditions.

Many of you know Ive mentioned a ``thing '' ive been going through, but I wasnt ready to share until I saw my MS specialist today and now I could use your feedback and opinions. We discused the JAMA journal article which came out last night- in his opinion, its hokey. It has too many holes, the survey wasnt monitored closely enough and there is ALOT of evidence that using a DMD (especially an interferon or Glatimer- Copaxone) DOES in fact (with evidence to support this) reduce the rate of progression, relapses and activity on a MRI. So here is why this is important to me. As many of you know I was taken off Rebif due to building up antibodies to it... it caused me many health issues, most of which will never be reversible. I started using LDN almost a year ago. I feel terrific. I look great, I have zero symtoms clinically and actually feel 200 times better than when I was on Rebif. BUT... I had an MRI ten days ago which showed not only disease progression, in the fact that I had many new lesions, I have one HUGE significant lesion on my PONS (part of brainstem) that for many people, would cause inability to breathe on ones own... its a part of the respiratory system, which is now compromised. Remember, I feel great... so, how could this be? After three hours with my doctor, we determined, I can not go back on Rebif- or any interferon due to the antibodies. I am JC Virus positive and he will not allow me on Tysabri. My doctor has stopped prescribing Gilenya- he has seen nothing but complications from his patients, everyone is progressing with additional MRI activity and most are having excaberations regularly. He doesnt believe in the drug. He DOES love what LDN is doing for me and in fact wrote me another year's script for it... HOWEVER he is very adamant that I need to be on something else as well. When on LDN, you can be on either Copaxone or IVIG treatments. We discussed both. His opinion is that I should try Copaxone, because it is ``tried and true '' with few side effects... save the IVIG infusions for worst case scenario... BUT, Copaxone doesnt have a very good record of reduction of relapses OR of reduction of MRI activity, its only about 35%... which, in his opinion, is 35% higher than doing nothing. He is very concerned that one more attack on my brain stem could leave me on a ventilator... Im not loving the idea of every day shots. Especially since I got so used to not doing any shots at all. Psychologically, this is difficult for me to wrap my head around again. But, being disabled or worse yet, unable to breathe- is much scarier... and then I circle back to ``its only a 35% chance it will work '' which then reminds me its better than zero chance. . Who here is on Copaxone? What can you tell me about how it makes you feel? Any adjustment period? How bad are the site reactions I am reading about? I am very thin- only 110 lbs- and have almost no body fat. I know from experience that its hard to inject Sub-cu with little body fat, but looks like I may have to overcome this obstacle. Not many people here have spoken about IVIG treatment. Ive been told, due to the nature of my work, Id have to quit my job if I go on this, because it will totally eliminate my immune system, something which LDN helps to stablize... but in his opinon, I shouldnt keep my job-I work around alot of infections... with Copaxone, there is a much lower risk of affecting my immune system... is anyone using IVIG? I realize that i have a huge decision to make, hes giving me tilll Monday to make it- one way or another, he wants me back on something- anything- to try to prevent another attack. Hard to imagine its ``that serious '' when Im actually feeling better than I have in years! All opinions are welcomed. Nikki######Nikki- wow that is scary. I 'm so sorry that this is happening for you. I do not like taking any mediaction at all, but still for me, the decision was easy. Actually, the only decision was which med to go on. I knew i would do anything that has any chance at all to help me. I think it was about a year before my dx, and my sister in law was dx with breast cancer (thankfully she is 100% okay today). After she had surgery, she was asked whether she wanted to do radiation in additon to the meds, and i remember talking with her about this decision and telling her why would you even have to think about doing something that can reduce chances? Of course, now i can understand why she had so much to think about. I remembered that when i was dx, and i was like i just have to choose a med. I dont know too much about copaxone except for what i read when i made my decision. I just couldnt deal with the shot every day. I am still having a fairly difficult time with giving myself injections so i know i made the right decision for me. That said, if i had to switch from rebif, that would likely be my next choice and i would definitely want to stay on something. I agree, being disabled is very scary and much scarier than the shots. I tell myself every time i inject that if this is the worst thing, i can handle it. I dont want to sound voodoo or witch doctor-ish, but what about adding a supplement regimen to whatever you choose to do? I personally would n't forego meds, but i have always thought about supplementing. I just wish i had the time right now to see an alternative type of dr but i have been working like crazy these last couple of months. I hope i 'm not rambling, my point is that i am of the school that i will do anything that can give me any possibility of not letting this disease progress. I hope you will not have any further issues no matter what decision you make. Take care.######You have to do what you think will work for you. It may simply mean that you are transitioning into a different type of MS. The disease progresses for nearly every MSer. Whatever you decide, no one can judge you nor admonish you. Prayers and support are all we can give and for many MSers, that is all we can depend on.######King Baxter I thank you for your words and comments. I wa in the same school of thought when I first went on Rebif. . anything is better than nothing. Maybe now I have to get back to that decision... As for supplements, when I first was dx, I spent a fortune on supplements, and took everything from fish oils to everything else you can read about. I tried diets, and yoga and basically every fad that I read about... I learned soon after, that I was not doing myself any good... that most of what I was taking, I was peeing out- that my body didnt need any supplemets at all, since my diet is so darned healthy. I now get tested for every deficiency three times a year, and I have none... there is no reason for ME to supplement anything... but for some, its a necessity- you should get tested. But I thank you for reminding me that doing nothing is not the best option! It really isnt... not for those of us who have a choice... Thank you. Nikki######Jayhawk, I actually asked him about whether or not my disease was progressing, if I was facing a new ``title '- if I was stil considered R/R. He said that I am NOT progressing... that progression is based on clinical synptoms- not radiographical lesions... so, the fact that more lesions are present, doesnt mean that I have progressed, it means that I need to stop the attacks before I start having clinical symtoms, in which case, it would be progressive. I trust this doctor. He is one of the leading MS specialists in the country and is published everywhere for his research. He has one of the largest MS practices on the East Coast, and runs the MS center in one of the bigger university hospitals in the NY/ NJ area. Nevertheless, You are right. . I do have to do what is right for me- just not entirely sure what that is at this point. Your prayers and wishes are absolutely accepted and appreciated. Thank you for your thoughts on this... N######MsNik, I am really sorry about this bad news and I know it must be frightening. I have been learning from you guys so of course I do n't know anything about the meds. What I do know is that I would take whatever is available and is the best available in terms of preventing progression. I know it will be a hard decision to make based on your job but for me I would prefer to be in better health with the better med than to be in worse health with a less effective med and a job. Hope I am making sense. I pray even though the lesion is there you will continue to remain symptom-free. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Big Hug P######MsNik, I am really sorry about this bad news and I know it must be frightening. I have been learning from you guys so of course I do n't know anything about the meds.

Hope I am making sense. I pray even though the lesion is there you will continue to remain symptom-free. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Big Hug P######Wow, sorry you are having such a hard time. I have a couple of large pontine lesions and depending on what level of the cranial nerve they effect, you may or may not have notable symptoms (especially a new onset lesion) Mine gives me trouble swallowing, speaking, ear pain and numbness, foot drop, leg weakness and heaviness and bladder spasticity. In the beginning, I had few symptoms from these lesions but they steadily have shown more progressive problems associated with them. I was on Copaxone for a couple of years-no problems with the shots themselves. The injector is easy to use for those who hatr needles, but I did mine by hand. This allows you to slowly infuse the meds into your leg so that it doesnt sting as bad. Do n't rub the spot you injected with Copaxone. I hardly had any symptoms on copaxone. Once or twice I got the immediate reaction. Interferons however, nearly killed me. I was in bone marrow failure for over 6 weeks before the physicians got it together to have me stop it. I will go on Tysabri next week. Try the copaxone as it is the one with the least side-effects (no flu-like symptoms, no need to check blood counts or liver enzymes.)######i think that the term progress can be loosely used. The very nature of MS is that it is a progressive disease whether the symptoms are clinical or radiological lesions. If you look at your benchmark- your original MRI- and compare it to where you are now, i think it fits within the definition of progression of the disease- at least this is how I view it. Considering your trouble with skin cancer, has this been factored into a regiment of daily shots? I would have trepidation about anything other than the LDN considering all you have been through. It could very well be that your troubles could be related to work load and academic stress building within you coupled with the ``lovely '' scorching summer heat... lesions can certainly develop due to stress levels. I think you might need to take your life down from overdrive to 2nd or 3rd gear... Still, I always keep you in my thoughts and prayers.######Jayhawk, again, thank you. I know you are right... you wont get any argument from me. The good news is I graduated school in May- what I am doing now is simply research for my Thesis- and there is no time frame, no need to push myself. The actual schooling part, is over... as well a the classes, tests and papers! SO, that is a HUGE load off my mind. Work, is a four letter word. I am the bread winner in my family, I have no choice but to work until I cant... with 3 kids we are responsible for, 2 of which are in college, there is no way to survive without my paycheck. So until I cant work, I will. . As far as the history of skin problems, that was discussed in detail- and I learned that due to the fact that those were caused by Interferon buildup, I shouldnt have a problem. Im not injecting into areas where obviously I had skin and tissue removed, but those areas are primarily on my lower legs, forearms and back- so I should be okay if you look at standard injectioin sites, such as thighs, belly and rear. We shall see. I actually havent made up my mind to do Copaxone... the info is very contrdictive and scares me. I think of you often, the med free aspect and realize that you dont have choices, but I also think that quite possibly, I need to leave this up to my higher power and eliminate the worry which accompanies doing shots altogether... Copaxone is not without its own side effects, even if flu like symtoms and liver problems arent ones to worry about. . Thank you again for your words of wisdom. Nikki######MS22, Thank you for your information. The biggest problem I have, is not having anywhere to inject. I did Rebif for years, and did not use the autoinjector, the needle factor isnt the problem, its the fact that I have virtually no fat on my body and almost no where to pinch which scares me. I actually think the shared solutions nurse would have a problem. Being that needles are a part of my everyday life anyway, I have no problem TRYING- I just have a fear of hitting nerves, having those horrible ISIR I keep reading about... those sound terrifying. Especially since I would be alone almost every shot. My husband is gone in the am and until 9 pm at night many nights... Im also reading that this is only ``so '' effective at reducing MRI activity and that the side effects of skin problems are permanent- and hair loss and thyroid issues are possiblilties... so I dont get liver damage, Instead, I deal with thyroid problems and hair loss and big welts? NOt exactly a selling point. I do appreciate your words however and thank you for taking the time to write them! Nikki######Preserved, Thank you also for taking the time to write back and post your thoughts. I can not agree that its all about ``taking anything that prevents progression '' when I have already been on several of these drugs and once had an allergic reaction to Copaxone... They want me to try it again, Im being told it was reformulated since that time when I first tried it- (I dont think I mentioned that in my post)- and also, Rebif, being the strongest of the DMDs, almost killed me... so Im not a huge fan of believing everything Im told... im a skeptic and a cynic, and having dealt with this for so long- Im very unsure what to do. As I sit and read the Copaxone brochures, and look at the manufacturer's data and trials, and the side effects- I wonder if this is even something I should be considering. After a totally sleepless night, I lean towards NO. But thats subject to change yet again. . I thank you for hoping that I remain symtom free, because in the end, thats what I hope as well. Prayers to you for good health and stability. Nikki######MSNik: I totally get it. I am a very thin person too. I hated the welts and rivets Copaxone left in my legs and arms. Yes, they were permanent. The ISIRs I agree are not fun, but do not happen very often and are not life threatening. I was just offering an opinion of the lesser of the evils overall. They all have their issues and I hope you can come up with one that is best for you.######If you need a fat transplant to cushion shots, let us know! You are welcome to as much fat tissue as you want!######Nikki, I can now see why this is a hard one for you. I do n't know about the meds and did not know your history with them. I have not even looked them up should I finally get dx and need to take any as I have enough stress dealing with.... not health related... and do n't want to take up more before getting there. I am praying for you that you ultimately make the best decision for your condition in all aspects. I truly believe in asking for guidance from the Almighty and so I pray He will direct you accordingly. Be of good courage and you are always in my prayers. Many hugs... it will be well. Dee######Nikki, I have n't been on this board for a while and just wanted to say good luck to you. You are a great contributor to this board and I wish you the best. Have you looked at published info on BG12? It may be approved by the end of the year or maybe early next year. My big dream is to get off rebif (9 damn years of it) and try something like BG12 with supposedly less side effects. Chris######Chris, One year ago I was told BG12 would be available by this time this year... then, 6 months ago, I was told it would be available by the end of the year. Yesterday, I was told it would be available by June of 2013... at this rate, it may never make it to market. I admit, it is intriguing; however I wouldnt go on it right away, there is absolutely no long term data on it, and some of the clinical trials are positive, while others are iffy... My doctor explained it to me yesterday and stated that once its on the market a year, he would consider it for me, but not until then... he actually stopped using Gilenya a few months ago as his patients are not doing well on it at all. But- as long as there is hope, right ??? Thanks! Nikki######Just wanted to send hugs.######Hi, Im pretty new to all this and I have only been on copaxone for a month now. But I just wanted to add something to try and help as youve always answered my questions. I can not inject my arms as theres no fat there so i hear what you are saying. Even though the auto injector can change the depth of the needle its still hard. I get really BIG lumps, last nights shot has came up like a tennis ball and is so damn itchy! Ive stopped injecting my tummy. The lumps there take ages to subside. So Im down to my thighs and butt areas. I figure theres enough room to keep the shots apart. Good luck, hope you can figure something out######Bazinga, Thanks for your experiences, but I was on the phone with shared solutions last night, and they actually told me if that happens, that it may be an allergic reaction and they wouldnt keep me on it. They said anything more than a slight red mark or small bump, isnt normal. Have you talked to your doctor about this? It doesnt sound very small to me, the way you describe it. In the past, if you have had this, how long do they remain that way and do they go away? If that was to happen to me, Id be done. I actually am leaning towards not doing this because the info Im getting- and reading- and hearing from the shared solutions team- makes me NOT want to do this drug... Im still not sure though. Thanks for sharing that, scary as it is, I do want to know. I hope you are stable and overall feeling well... Nikki######Nikki, Obviously, you 've got loads more experience than I do with this stuff so I ca n't offer any valuable opinion or advice, but I did want to let you know that I 'll be thinking about you. I 'm sorry that this stressful decision has been added to your plate when you already had a lot going on. I 'm wishing you well...######MSNik I think the advice they are all giving you is very wise you have to make the best desion for you. I am currently on Copaxone and have had progression all I can do is leave you with that advice. Praying for you.######No advice just a hug. It really sucks that you are dealing with this. I did want to say that I think we share a doctor. If I 'm right he really is wonderful.######Zeror, You said you were currently on copaxone and are having progression. May I ask, how long were you on Copaxone when progression was noted, and is that radiographically, or clinically? Reeny, Id love to know if we share a doctor. I remember when you were first here and I shot you out some names... its quite possible you are using one of the ones I use! im glad you are happy with him. Nikki######I have been on Copaxone for 7 mouths and the progression was both clinically and radiographically. I hope this helps.######Thanks Zerror. Reading the information on Copaxone from the manufacturer, even the clinical trial results, it does say that it doesnt reach full efficacy for 9 months. Rebif states 6. When I started Rebif, I had 2 relapses in the first 2 months, and 4 new lesions in the first six... after the 6 month mark, no more of either until I started getting sick FROM the medication. I hope that now that you are closer to the 7 month mark, you are more stable and that your next MRI shows nothing new. Thats my dilemma right now... should I start the copaxone and repeat the MRi in 6 months (my doctors plan) or should I say bag it, and hope that BG12 or another drug is on the market in 6 months? It seems like an awful lot of pain and aggravation- and risk! To start copaxone knowing it probably isnt going to help me for the next 4-9 months anyway... What kind of reactions have you had on the drug? Any IRIS? That sounds realy scary. Are you thin or heavy? Have you had any skin reactions which are disturbing? All of these things worry me. Im very thin, and have virtually no subcutaneous fat... from my 3 times a week experience with Rebif- I did build up lipoatrophy in many of the ``shot '' areas. . I know this is going to be really challenging to find places to do the shot. I also know Ill be alone 99% of the time when I have to do them, so IRIS scares the dickens out of me as well. . can you share any experiences, good or bad about the injections and reactions? Thanks! Nikki######MsNik, this is just to let you know I have been thinking about you and praying for you. I know you said you have to make a decision by tomorrow (Monday) and so I continue to pray you will be guided in making the best decision for you. Hugs Dee######Hi- Nik- I think that you may have read my posts in the past that have been about Copaxone- but just in case you have n't, I 'll share my experience again. I have been on Copaxone for 4 years and 7 months. My initial diagnoses was Oct 1 2007. I had optic neuritis, diagnosed by a Neuro opth, and was then referred to a Neuro, who then referred me to an MS specialist. I was given all of the pamphlets, read up on the internet, and still did n't know what to do. My initial gut instinct was to go with one of the drugs that did n't have to be given on a daily basis. When I ended up back with my Neurologist to make the final decision, he steared me away from the rebif/avonex route. He felt that because of the job I have, along with having young children, that my life would be easiest, and the least changed by taking the Copaxone. He also said that he had many, many patients that were on Copaxone and doing very well. I was under the impression that he had more on COpaxone than any of the others. SO I started that drug Jan 1 2008. Toward the end of January, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my lower half of my body. I was put on steroids for 2or 3 days, and this had resolved within a week. Then, about 2 weeks (?) later my legs started to feel heavy one afternoon when I was at work, and that progressed to a foot drop in one leg. From there I was given additional steroids. By one week later, I was walking back to normal, but could still feel some weakness. There were no changes in my MRI and my Neuro said that it takes several months for the COpaxone to start working and was not switching my RX. The leg issue resolved. Over the next few months, I noticed I had l'hermittes and a patch of skin on the left side of my back that had some sensory changes. It was more sensitive, but at the same time, slightly numb. My MD was not at all concerned about this. I continued on the Copaxone. I had the l'hermittes and sensory issue on my back for several months, but learned to ignore it because my DR was not concerned. He ws impressed with how well I was doing, in fact. He would remind me that the longer I am on the COpaxone, the better it will work. Since the sensory stuff went away, I have n't had any MS symptoms. My Neuro keeps telling me I am very stable and that the studies for COpaxone look so good. We are both very pleased. I do n't know if this is just a period of disease inactivity, or if I 'm doing this well because of the Copaxone. When I first started injecting the copaxone, I would get a welt, maybe 2 or so inches around, and just slightly raised. Sometime I would get a hard lump. In the beginning I would ice the site both before and after to help with that. It did n't happen every time tho. I do n't know how far into all of this I quite having to do that, but, it 's been years since I 've had to ice the area. It seems like that was just in those first few months. Generally its quick with just a bee sting. Sometimes with my legs, I 'll get it maybe too deep and it will hurt like h-- for a bit and I 'll even limp around. That is not the normal. I never have pain when injecting my arms or hips. Those are my favorite spots, but I do rotate to every site possible, every day. Each year I go into see my Neuro, he tells me to keep injecting my Copaxone, I 'm doing great. I feel normal- like I really do n't even have MS.. . except for the daily reminder with the shot. I remember reading that you had an anaphylactic reaction when you tried Copaxone before. What does the DR say about this? THat would be my main concern. Best of luck with your decision. Take care!######Thank you very much SodaPopper. I needed exactly what you wrote. I did have ana. shock with Copaxone in 2005. You are correct. I am being told by both my doctor and the manufacturer (teva) that it was reformulated in late 2006, and the ingrediant which so many people were allergic to, removed. That doesnt prevent me from being absolutely scared to death to try it. Obviously, the nurse will be with me if I decide to do so for my first shot, and ever since my Rebif episodes, I do carry an Epi pen with me at all times. I am more concered at this point with where the heck Im going to inject. I am SO THIN. People laugh and say they wish that they had my problem, but I drink protein shakes daily and drink full fat milk, eat icecream and milkshakes and can not gain weight. I have virtually no subcutaenous fat on my body. Im terrified of this idea of injecting daily... Stil havent made up my mind and the clock is ticking... but thank you. I really appreciate what you wrote. It means alot. Nikki######Hi Nik, I see Dr. Joseph Herbert. The info you gave sounds a lot like his backround.######Nope. He isnt my doctor... but Im glad you like him. Nikki.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

And MS question.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis######I think I 'm going to choose copaxone as my MS drug of choice, however, I 've heard a few reports of copaxone causing weight gain. If you 've taken Copaxone, what have your experiences been? I know weight gain seems like a superficial concern, but I have psoriatic arthritis and additional weight plays havoc on my joints. Also, I have a question for all you experienced MSers. I know l'hermittes sign is caused by a lesion on the cervical spine. Will the lesion always show up on the MRI? Can you have a lesion on the c-spine and it not show up on the MRI?######Cricket, L ``hermittes is not always caused by a lesion on the cervical spine. I randomly experience L'Hermittes and have NO lesions (ever) on my Cspine. It can be a simple reaction from a nerve in the brain as well... they arent completely sure what causes it, and there is much speculation... As for Copaxone- all MS drugs will cause you to gain weight, its an unfortunate side effect... also, because with Copaxone you are injecting daily, you will have to increase your water intake substantially- they say up to 12 eight oz glasses of water a day. Not always easy, since most MSers have frequency or urgency issues to begin with- but my point is, you will gain water weight, no matter what. You can not stay on an injection regimen without increasing your fluid intake. I wasnt on Copaxone long enough to gain any weight, but I remember when the Shared Solutions nurse came to my house, she mentioned that it was one of the worst drugs for that side effect; which wasnt a problem at the time, since I was ten pounds underweight... when I started on Rebif, I was also told that it, would increase my weight... and it did, by about ten lbs. Im very small, only 5 ' 4 and only 110 lbs (at this time) with small bones, so an increase of ten lbs was actually healthy for me; however I cant tell you how many people have asked me if Ive lost weight since I went off Rebif 6 months ago. I actually have; however Im working out alot more, since I feel so much better, and I believe that Im gaining back the weight in muscle mass. Hope that helps alittle. Nikki######Thanks so much for the info on copaxone and weight gain. Maybe I 'll try to lose ten pounds before I start taking it, so when I add 10 pounds it wo n't matter. Regarding the l'hermitte's, if it 's due to a lesion in the brain, will that show on MRI? Reason, I 'm so obsessed about seeing lesions on the MRI is that my neuro, despite being a MS specialist, is very MRI reliant. I currently have optic neuritis, and the neuro-opthamologist saw prior history of optic neuritis in my now good eye, so that should be enough to bring me from CIS to clinically definite MS. However, I worry that if my neuro does n't see new lesions on my brain or c-spine, that she still wo n't give me a formal diagnosis. I 'm hoping that given my new l'hermitte's sign, that means I have a new lesion that will be seen on the MRI.######Another weight gain comes from diminished ability to exercise before limitations set in. Reducing caloric intake may be needed. I used to power lift and my caloric intake is less than half of what I used to consume. Hydration is important for MSers whether med or med free. Dehydration can creep up especially since MSers can be left without a proper ``thermostat ''. Hydration also plays a role in muscles and joints.######What Jayhawk said is a very good point which I completely overlooked. Being that I am still able to be so mobile, and I run around all day long- I completely forgot about the fact that if I couldnt, my weight probably wouldnt be so stable. Good point Jayhawk! As for the question about the MRI. ITs not your neuro who is being MRI reliant- its the criteria. Are you familiar with the revised McDonald criteria, it clearly states, in order to give a MS diagnosis, what needs to be seen by the physician. Lesions, are on the list. Yes, usually a lesion which could be responsible for L'Hermittes will show up, but L'hermittes is not necessarily a MS thing either; yes, it happens in many MSers, but it can also happen from something like neck trauma or head trauma... so, its not a valid MS symtom in the eyes of most doctors... its simply a response to a nerve which is damaged... one can damage a nerve a million ways besides having MS. I think your doctor is going to tell you its MS and not CIS because too many things are going on with you.... but, I also think youll regret it. You will never be able to get certain types of insurance again (long term care) your life insurance may triple in price- you will have a problem with a pre-existing condition when others see MS on your diagnosis- hospitals will not treat you the same and instead assume everything is MS related (which they can do nothing about). When I crashed on my Rebif I was in and out of the hopsital 7 times in ten days. I was so sick I honestly wanted to die. When they found melamona all over my back, they tried to tell me it was from the sun. I havent been in the sun in 29 years- that was a long shot. But, when they told me that my fever, chills and aches and pains were all MS induced, I knew I needed more help... my Neuro finally ran the tests for the antibodies; it WAS the Rebif which was literally poisoning my system- I had developed so high a level of antibodies that with each shot I did, I hurt myself more and more. I started feeling better within a week of coming off Rebif... Dont be in too much of a hurry to be labeled. Its not worth pushing your doctor into something, when you already know why you are feeling like you are. CIS is a type of MS; and it appears you are being treated well for it. Just remember, once you get that label, its on you forever. Nikki######You 're right MSNik. I never thought of the practical implications of a MS diagnosis. I was so frustrated with being in limbo land that I never thought beyond wanting a formal answer. I never realized how that label could affect other aspects of my life. You 've definitely changed my perspective. As for the weight gain, I 've had severe psoriatic arthritis for almost 10 years. I have permanent damage in my left foot and frequently ca n't walk more than two blocks without rest or assistance. Suffice it to say, I already have decreased mobility, so maybe the copaxone wo n't make that much difference. I 've changed my thinking in terms of medication options. I 'm alternating between taking copaxone or not taking anything at all. I 'm allergic to many, many medications. Due to all the psoriatic arthritis nonsense, I 've taken numerous medications and I generally do n't have good experiences with them. As of now, my motor systems do n't appear to be affected. I mostly have sensory and visual symptoms. I do have balance issues, but those might have pre-existed the neurological problems. I 've always been rather uncoordinated. I realize though, by not taking medication, I 'm taking gambling with my health. I have n't made a firm decision either way, and obviously part of my decision will be based on what my neuro says next Wednesday.######Well, good luck next wed.. You should read up on LDN and MS. Low Dose Naltrexone, actually is one of the few meds where the side effect is losing weight apparently. I cant say Ive lost any, but then I didnt really have any to lose... but others have told me they have lost 5-7 lbs... Beyond the weight issue, LDN is safe- and proven effective in Europe; however it is hard to get your doctor to prescribe it, since it is off label- look into Skips Pharmacy- dr. Skip has some info which you can print out and show your doctor... I wish you the best... nikki.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

Please before reading this let me say, if your response is that I 'm in denial, do n't post. I am just curious what others think about my situation. In May of 2010 I woke up with sudden visual disturbances in my right eye. I called my opthamologist and they urged me to come in immediatley. The doctor called my Neuro I had just started seeing for migraines the week before and they told me to go to the E.R. asap. I went to the hospital and was admitted with no explanation as to why and ended being there for 4 days. Within the first couple of hours of being there they did a spinal tap, evoked potential, and the next morning MRI (there were lesions) and that test where they do the electric pulses on your toes. The on call Optho came to see me and said it was a very mild case of Optical Neuritis and he honestly did not believe it was MS related... Wait? MS? This was the first time these words were uttered to me! My neuro showed up for a minute the first day and then 2 days later came in my room at 7 a.m. woke me said its MS and left. No explanation, did n't wait for my husband to arrive to tell me, no sympathy. Nothing. After having an incredibly traumatizing experience, being in shock, and being appalled at the behavior of this doctor I saught out a second opinion. Problem is this, half my doctors do n't think it 's MS the other half do. I had absolutley no symptoms prior to this episode, and I always hear people say ``well thinking back on it... '' Nope I ca n't think of a single instance. Given all of this, I think to some degree I should question this diagnosis. Just curious if anyone has any thoughts? thanks !!######Hello carbo29, To answer your basic question, were you diagnosed too quickly-- maybe, maybe not. Some do get diagnosed quickly others do n't. Optic Neuritis (ON) can be associated with MS, however, not every case of ON is MS related and not everyone with MS has ON. Were you told if your spinal tap (lumbar pucture) was positive or negative, any mention of Oligoclonal Banding? As far as the lesions: were the lesion on the optic nerve only and/or included other areas of the brain? If you do n't have the answer to these questions then you need to start asking them of your doctor (s). For your own peace of mind you need to ask how and on what they based their diagnosis of MS. If you have lesions on the brain and not just the optic nerve, if your lumbar puncture was positive and with Optic Neurits you could be diagnosed either with MS or Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). CIS simply means you have had your first Neurological ``event. '' The diagnostic phrasing would be up to the Neurologist.######Hi thank you for your response. LP was negative, no bands. The lesions are on the brain but I would have to read the report again to tell you where exactly. You 're right I do need to ask my doctor. I do n't go back until May, so I guess I was just looking for some opinions, but, I was never told why exactly they came to the conclusion of MS. They just said ``here, start taking this DMD and come see me every few months... '' I have n't had the best experiences with this... Again, thank you for responding######carbo29, You might do some research on MS at The National Multiple Sclerosis Society. There is a wealth of information about the disease as well as how it is diagnosed. MS is a clinical diagnosis, there is no single test by it 's self that can indicate MS. At the very least you will be prepared for your next appointment with a better understanding.######Thank you I have been to the site, I just feel like I do n't get anywhere with my particular questions because everything involving MS is or at least seems so vague. Even when I ask my doctor the answers are always ``well it could be MS or it could be that you 're (insert anything else here)... '' It just seems very difficult to get a straight answer about ANYTHING. I ca n't even tell you if I 've had a flare because I have no clue what the guidelines are. I mean I get the whole lasting more than 24 hours thing but is a pain in my foot a flare? Or feeling very tired ??? I feel like I ca n't get anywhere because no one (I mean my doctors) seems to have a legit response to anything I question. I guess I am feeling like my questions are leaving me with more questions.######Welcome to MS. You may never get a 100% answer to your liking, but that is the elusive nature of MS. What affects you may not affect me. When I was diagnosed in 1982, there were fewer answers than you can now get. I know it can be frustrating, but please do not let it ``eat at you ''. If doctors knew the answers to your questions 100% of the time, we would be closer to a cure. You can consider yourself lucky to have been diagnosed quickly because many MSers go through long periods of not knowing or experience doctors unwilling to step up with a diagnosis. I do not think it is wise for a doctor to give you a DMD and tell you to start taking it without discussing the pro's and con's of the particular DMD. You should be given info with which you can make an informed decision as to whether a DMD is the right choice for you and as to which DMD meets your comfort level.######HI Carbo. Im hearing and feeling your pain. My advice to you is similar to Snoopy's, but Id add one thing. Have you considered seeing a MS specialist and not a regular Neurologist? MS Specialists both diagnose and rule out MS and they have seen and heard every imaginable symtom. No two cases of MS are exactly alike, they call it a snowflake disease, for this reason. Many people have similar basic symtoms, fatigue, numbness, etc, but some get vertigo, others dont. Some have pain, others dont. Muscle spasms, balance issues, heat sensitivity are all individual. Snoopy is right though that you should be able to quote how many lesions you have, whether or not they were active at the time of the MRI. what part of the brain they are on, means NOTHING, but lesions are not always MS lesions. Migranes, prior brain trauma, a car accident, can all leave lesions. Lesions, are scars... only a trained Neuro, or Radiologist or MS specialist is really appropriate to know from looking at a MRI if they are MS like or not. . Also, how many lesions you have doesnt mean much... I have way more then most people, more then 50- and yet I am a 4.0 student in Grad school, work fulltime, the whole ``normal ' thing... but I have MS. As for the DMD. I do not entirely agree with Jayhawk, only for one reason. All 3 of the interferons give you the same side effects, the basic difference in the drugs is how they are administered. Copaxone, is used when the patient is either having extremely few symtoms, has CIS (only one incident of attack) or is allergic or unable to tolerate the Interferons. Its the less strong of the DMDs. . Rebif is the strongest, Betaseron is next and Avonex is the lowest interferon... their efficacy reports can all be read and compared. So were you diagnosed too quickly? Hard to say... but if you have any doubts, you need to get the answers from the right doctor! Please keep us posted and let us know what you find out... Nikki######thank you very much for the suggestions! I did not even think about an MS specialist, I guess I assumed a neurologist was an MS specialist... naive I know, I will look into this now for sure. My husband I think just wants me to accept it and move forward, but I do n't think I 'm there yet. And maybe having a specialist confirm it or not will get me there. My husband is very supportive but I think he worries about me getting my hopes up that it is nothing and being devastated all over again like it was at the hospital. I will keep you posted and again thank you for your advice and suggestions######Carbo, Three drs (two radialogists and a brain surgeon) said my three lesions were not MS looking. Then an MS specialist read the MRI, sliced it a little differently and said they were MS lesions and one was responsible for the vertigo I was feeling. I did n't even have many symptoms at the time-- nor did she send me for a spinal tap. She knew it was a clinically isolated syndrome and suggested meds right away. Niki, I never heard about copaxone only being for CIS or as you stated... does that mean it 's not as strong. . I do n't want to steal this thread so please respond separately if you think.######Avonex, Rebif, Copaxone and Betaseron can all be used for CIS. I do n't know if the 2 newer meds are being used for CIS.######Yes, Snoopy is right; all four of the disease modifying drugs CAN be used for CIS, but Rebif, is never recommended. Normally, Avonex and Copaxone are, because they are the lowest doses of the drugs. Being that Rebif is so much stronger of an interferon, its usually reserved for people who are still showing activity on their MRIs, have lots of activity and lesions (like I did at the time of my dx) or who have been on Copaxone and are still having relapses. Copaxone is NOT only used as a CIS drug... for many people with only a few lesions and minor MS symtoms who wish to start on a DMD, its the perfect choice for them; and alllows them OTHER options if its not strong enough. For people who do not tolerate Interferons, it was once the only option; but we all know that has changed in the past 18 months. The way that Copaxone works is quite different then the way Interferons work, and sometimes what works for one patient, just doesnt work for another. The newest drugs also work in differnt ways, therefore we now have choices which ten years ago, we didnt have! Sorry If I confused you! Nikki######Jodi- If you do n't mind me asking, you said you had minimal symptoms when you were diagnosed, what lead to you being tested for MS? I had no symptoms besides the ON, so I was very shocked when they told me this. Just curious what lead to yours? thanks######Hi Carbo, my only symptom that led me to the dr. was a severe vertigo attack with remaining vertigo/balance/dizzy issues. I went right away to the dr. (physician assistant) and of course she dismissed it as benign and gave me some standard med and than I went to an ear/nose/throat and they said looks like one of those crazy ear things (my ears were fine they could n't find anything). Then my very kind dr. sent me for an MRI. Over the course of several weeks after I experienced other symptoms but nothing major-- some leg weakness, my eye felt ``heavy '', some fatigue. I would never put those with MS. After the MRI came back with three lesions, they did the eye test and saw some very minor thinning of my nerve (commonly assoc. with MS). Finally, in retrospect I see other symptoms I 've had for years (bladder etc). Does that help?######yes thank you, I only ask because prior to my episode of ON I had no symptoms. Not even in looking back, I can not recall anything that stands out to me. I always wonder how people got to their diagnosis.######I think a combination of MRI and symptoms. Perhaps your case was found early and that is the best news there is! I do believe mine was early too. The MS dr. said I am very lucky.######When I was diagnosed my Dr said that with the amount of plaque I had in my brain, that this disease was not new to me. I also had a small lesion on my cervical spine. He discussed all the meds with me, gave me brochures to study, sent me to an MS specialist, and in the end... my Neuro said that if he had to choose a drug for himself or a family member, it would be Copaxone. I 've been on it for 3 years and am feeling great!######my doctor put me on copaxone only because my husband and I were planning on starting a family very soon, I wish my doctor would have been as thorough as yours though. I would have appreciated the explanations.######I appreciate hearing good stories on copaxone. i want to get that needle done so fast in the morning but i noticed when i plunge it in fast, i have some of that heavy chest/hard breathing feeling. Also, sometimes it 's hard to get the needle plunge started.######My husband did my injections for me prior to finding out we were expecting because it was easier on me to do the injection at a slower speed. I found the side effects were not nearly as bad when we did a 10 second count vs. the 5 second with the autoject. I did n't need to ice down and I did n't get the ``bumps ''. Although, I did get the itching like a MoFo still. ALSO, I began getting very severe panic attacks that were crippling and my doctor and Shared Solutions insisted were not a side effect... they are and it was confirmed by others who use Copaxone and a neurologist. As soon as I stopped taking Copaxone the panic stopped too. On a positive note, the lesions they originally found on my first MRI had completely disappeared and I had no new ones 7 months after starting.######Carbo, did you stop treatment because you are pregnant or because or lesions are gone or both? I am surprised to hear you did n't have the bumps with the ten second. I still get it all just not as bad. Good for you! I go for my first annual MRI in May, fingers crossed!######I am rereading your first post-- so it sounds like you were never sure of your diagnosis, but you opted for treatment but now have stopped? We are very alike-- my drs. had mixed opinions too but I went with the specialist's.######Jodi- I was immediately told I needed to start on a DMD before I was even out of the hospital. I was n't told to consider my options or given any information on any of the drugs. I was just told ``here use this ''. I realize now that I was given Copaxone because I am young (29) and my husband and I wanted to start a family. The reason I stopped using it was because I found out I was pregnant. But, I have had a 50/50 split on the doctors. two said they are not convinced it is ms and two said it is. I have not seen a specialist yet. I am going to wait until after I deliver to set up an appointment. I guess I should rephrase the ``bumps '' comment. With the autoject I would get what looked like a really bad mosquito bite times ten, with the 10 second count it was more like a bump under the skin like a goose egg but smaller. Also, yes the whole lesions disappearing thing made me wonder if it was the med or if it had anything to do with my migraines (I get very severe ones). Good luck with your MRI I will for sure keep my fingers crossed for you.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

My neuro told me that due the diagnostic criteria set forth he can not say definitively that I do, but nothing else explains the lesions in my brain and the elevated protein bands in my spinal fluid. My VEP was normal, all my bloodwork as were the MRI's on my neck and spine. The only two tests that came back abnormal were the brain MRI and LP. My neuro wants me to have another brain MRI in one month to see if my lesions have changed. Regardless of the results, I think he 'll want to go ahead and start me on an interferon. For anyone that has already started this treatment, do you have any information as to side effects or a good website to check out?######You may want to check out all of the CRABs: Copaxone, Rebif, Avonex and Betaseron. Copaxone is the only non-interferon, and has virtually no side-effects. (This is what I chose.) The others tend to have the flu-like side-effects. Your neuro will probably have an opinion, but all the meds have web-sites. Glad you got closer to a dx!######I have been on copaxone for 6 months and have had no side effects except for site reactions, I find out next week if it is working for me. . good luck with everything.######I was originally on copaxone (for two weeks) and when I went for my second opinion i was told that copaxone has n't been proven to work for people who have RRMS- so I had to switch to avonex which has had research done and has proven to help. I will be going in a few months to see if it is working for me. Good luck. JP######wowser- where did you hear that about copaxone? there was all this information recently about the 26 year data that shows it is effective in treating RRMS. . reducing relapse rates. . etc.. .######I have been on Copaxone about a month now with no side effects at all. Shared Solutions has been great as well. March 18,2005) Given the recent news surrounding the multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies, Teva Neuroscience announced today that COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate injection) is the only available relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) therapy that does not carry a warning or precaution for liver damage and does not require additional laboratory testing. This clarification is important due to recent announcements regarding two approved products in the MS market. The recent marketing suspension on one newly approved product and the FDA-issued warning for liver damage on the other prompted Teva Neuroscience to clarify the attributes of COPAXONE. The multiple sclerosis community is asking tough questions about MS therapies. Teva Neuroscience, a leader in the field of neurology, understands the concern and confusion weighing on the minds of people living with MS and their carepartners. The company wants to reassure both physicians and patients that there is a wealth of data to support the efficacy and safety of their product, COPAXONE. The science behind COPAXONE has been developed over many years, including an ongoing, long-term, prospective extension trial that has spanned the last 12 years. The importance of researching and weighing the evidence when selecting a therapy is critical. COPAXONE is an RRMS therapy supported by three Class I Phase III trials (prospective, randomized, and controlled) establishing efficacy and safety1 ,2,3. Class I means the studies met the highest standards for quality according to experts4. The three studies included two two-year studies, showing how effective COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate injection) is in reducing relapses over the long term1 ,2. One of the two-year studies was extended as an open-label trial to 12 years with a commitment to extend to 15 years making it the longest continuous study ever of patients with RRMS5. A third study showed people on COPAXONE had steady reductions in the number of new brain MRI lesions3. Furthermore, COPAXONE is presumed to have a dual mechanism of action both outside and within the central nervous system (where MS is active) to reduce inflammation at the site of brain lesions6 ,7. Following stringent regulatory review, COPAXONE has received approval for treatment of RRMS in 42 countries worldwide. These approvals were based on well-controlled Phase III trials demonstrating efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Additionally, numerous other open-label studies have supported the effectiveness of COPAXONE 8-12. Clinical experience with COPAXONE has led to endorsement of its use in published guidelines by the American Academy of Neurology, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Association of British Neurologists. We want people living with MS to feel confident in their therapy decision and take comfort in the fact that COPAXONE has been studied for more than a decade and does not carry a precaution or warning for liver damage, said Larry Downey, Teva Neuroscience President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition to clinical data, COPAXONE has more than 340,000 patient-years of exposure in post-marketing data through November 2004. As part of its commitment to the MS community, Teva Neuroscience created Shared Solutions, a free service offering support, knowledge, and answers for anyone affected by MS. People living with or touched by MS are encouraged to call Shared Solutions at -LRB-800-RRB- 887-8100 for answers to questions about living with the disease and drug therapy. About COPAXONE The FDA has approved drugs for RRMS, such as COPAXONE. Current data suggest COPAXONE is a selective MHC class II modulator. COPAXONE is indicated for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The most common side effects of COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate injection) are redness, pain, swelling, itching, or a lump at the site of injection, flushing, chest pain, weakness, infection, pain, nausea, joint pain, anxiety, and muscle stiffness. These reactions are usually mild and seldom require professional treatment. Some patients report a short-term reaction right after injecting COPAXONE. This reaction can involve flushing (feeling of warmth and/or redness), chest tightness or pain with heart palpitations, anxiety, and trouble breathing. These symptoms generally appear within minutes of an injection, last about 15 minutes, and go away by themselves without further problems. Call 1-800-887-8100 for more information about COPAXONE, Team COPAXONE, or multiple sclerosis. References: Bornstein MB, Miller A, Slagle S, et al.. N Engl J Med. 1987; 317:408 -414.

My neuro wanted me to choose either Rebif of Copaxone. When I chose Copaxone she told me Rebif might show improvement in 3 months, more like 6 months for Copaxone. Given the side-effects issues, and the fact that I am working and traveling, etc, it was a no-brainer for me. All I 've heard, read and been told, Copaxone, Rebif and Avonex are the best choices for RRMS. Betaseron may be better for SPMS.######Goodness, I think Copaxone seems to be a favored drug. Thank you for all your advice. I do have a question though. Copaxone is a noninterferon, correct? Does that mean that it only helps with relapses and does n't necessarily prevent further progression of the disease? I get confused between the interferons and noninterferons.######can someone tell me what is an LP?######LP stand for lumbar puncture. . basically a spinal tap.######dgibson70, Here try this. www.mswatch.com/Therapy Hope it helps.######I think your neuro you had the 2nd from had that backwards, it 's has n't been proven effective for primary progressive possibly, but it is approved for relapsing remitting..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

I had so many symptoms but never suspected MS. I was in complete denial. My doctor gave me the choice to choose a treatment between Avonex and Copaxone, I wanted Avonex but my insurance denied it and instead approved Rebif or Copaxone. I was wondering if anyone in this forum is on Copaxone as I am leaning more towards Copaxone, (no flu symptoms, no liver or blood cell warning etc) I travel a lot and thought that the once a week will be perfect but as my insurance does not approve it, I need some help with the decision. Thanks in advance######Hi Rem, I too had a lot of symptoms but never believed it could be MS so my dx was a shock. Seven months on and I think it 's still sinking in. I 'm not on any medication, so I ca n't give you advice on that, but if you do a search on this board for each of the drugs you 'll find tons of information. What I can tell you is to relax and take it slow. You sound like you 're panicing. Do n't feel pressured into picking one. Read all the info and choose one when you 're comfortable. And welcome to the board! Post any questions- you 'll get lots of advice and support here. Cat######I had site reactions with Copaxone and had to stop it after only 5 weeks. Months later, the lumps and bruises are still there. A friend with MS also had to stop Copaxone for the same reasons except on her skin, they became like divets. I was on Avonex for 2 months, the flu was n't that bad but the depression was. Good luck with your decision, I 've heard good things about Rebif.######Hi just to let you know, Im on Rebif. . and LOVE IT. its only 3 days a week, and because the injections are subcutaneous (beneathe the skin, not into the muscle) the needle is SO small and I hardly feel it. Also, you should know that Rebif and Avonex are the same drug... the difference is, REbif is given 3 times a week, instead of once a week and the benefit of that is that the medicine stays in your bloodstream at a more consistent rate, never really dropping, never giving your body that ``I need a shot '' feeling. I also will report to you that the flu like symtoms only lasted 3 months, only last 4-6 hours the day of the shot, then disappear entirely... After one year on Rebif (last month) I had my yearly MRIs and can report that no new lesions have appeared, and my MS is stable at this time... Rebif is doing what its supposed to do. SOrry to hear you joined the MS club... but you will be fine. We are all struggling with some setbacks and getting used to the disease, however its not the end of the world. Let us know if we can help you in other ways. MSNik######I do not take any meds, but if you travel a lot, please make sure you have all your documentation in place- prescriptions, etc.. I wear a medical bracelet to indicate my condition and the fact that no meds are taken. If your travel takes you overseas, please note that some countries will limit what you can bring with you. If you are carrying prescriptions, this makes you a bigger target for thieves. If you travel a lot, you might need to slow your life down a bit for your body to recover and stay healthy. If your doctor insists on Avonex and you want to take meds, the doctor can get the insurance to cover it if your doctor explains the reasoning for it.######Thank you all who answered me, I am glad I found this board. I still have million of questions, how come some of you are not taking the meds? is it personal decision? does the med help with symptoms? Or just slow the progress of MS? I have so many symptoms do they ever go away? would love to hear your comments. Thanks######The meds, Rebif, Avonex, Copaxone, etc. are designed to slow the progression of the disease. There are other med's to treat the symptoms. I am fortunate in that my symptoms are rather mild compared to others on this board. Be sure to post any questions regarding your specific symptoms so that those of us here who have similar issues can give you the benefit of our experiences. Indeed, the decision to start the medication is a serious one and very personal. Do n't feel pressured by anyone, including your doctor, it is YOUR choice. You are among friends here. Mitch######I was diagnosed in 1982. I did not want to take steroids due to their side effects. My doctor told me that my body would, on it own, heal. He warned me to eat right, get sufficient rest, and to avoid stress. I enjoyed 18 years of remission and when my remission ended in 2002, my MS was Primary Progressive MS or PPMS. There is no medication for PPMS at this time. I continue to watch for triggers (things that cause flare-ups), limit my stress, eat right, and get my rest. What you do with your body is indeed your personal choice. I chose to be medication free. What you should do is to read all the medication literature, ask your doctor, and check out case studies of long-term medication use. That way, when you make your decision, you will have made a fully informed decision for yourself.######Hi, I was just diagnosed in April. I am on Betaseron, which is an every other day shot. The good thing about Betaseron is that since you travel a lot you do n't have to refrigerate it. It comes in a package and you mix the medicine, it takes two seconds to do. But it would definitley help not having to take a cooler pack with you. I think the other drugs must be refridgerated. Good luck, each medicine has a website to check out all the info on. ALso the national ms society website is really good. It explains the diffrences in the 5 drugs. Good Luck######I 'm just not convinced enough to continue with my meds at this time. I `am going through a whole lot at this time and it 's just a ``one more thing '' I do n't feel like dealing with. I had bad reactions with my first drug (Copaxone) and a lot of depression with the Avonex. At the moment, I feel better physically than I have in some time. It is your decision and maybe not an easy one but do what is right for you.######HI, just wanted to add, being on Rebif. Rebif can be NOT refrigerated up to 28 days. I dont refrigerate mine, per my doctors instructions. I find that the medicine doesnt burn at all, and I never get a site reaction if I keep it at room temperature! I even hold the syringe in my hand for 5 minutes to bring it up to body temp before I inject... Also, I travel. Alot. Both daily, and monthly, both nationally and internationally. I have NEVER had a problem bringing a months supply of Rebif with me anywhere. I carry a prescription for it, with the medicine and keep it on me at all times... seriously, a months supply of Rebif takes up less room then a single shoe in my carry on bag- and the manufacturer of Rebif makes really neat travel bags to keep your syringes, alcohol wipes, autoinjector (if you choose to use it) altogether in one small bag. . it even has an area for an ice pack. But does it help with the symtoms? no. Rebif, Copaxone and Avonex and Betaseron are designed to prevent new symtoms from forming, and reduce MRI activity (no new lesions means no new symtoms) and slow down progression. None of them will take away damaged Myelin which is already causing issues... so the big question becomes are you willing to postpone starting meds because either your not committed at this time to doing so, or because you dont want the side effects, or because you dont feel that your disease warrants them (this is the personal side of the choice) or are you of the choice that starting meds as soon as you are first diagnosed will prevent your disease from progressing.... also a personal chioce. There is no right or wrong answer here... my doctors all TOLD me to get on meds asap so that my MS would stay controllable... a year later, and a year of being on Rebif, nothing has progressed and things are all good... however, is it luck? The Rebif? or my lot in life ?? NO one can tell for sure... I just feel bettr knowing Im doing EVERYTHING I can do to take control of Ms and not let it control me.######I 've been on Rebif for almost 3 months. I 've stopped falling, which is a good thing, and I have less numbness in my right leg. I 've had one bout of wicked side effects, but otherwise I 'm OK. It 'll be 6 months before they 'll be able to tell how well it 's working. For me, meds were a no-brainer. I was dignosed at 54, but think I was showing signs in my forties. Progression can be faster when you are diagnosed at a later age, and althogh I 've accomodated, more or less, to my current level of disability, I do n't want to slide down the slope, and in the year before DX I was. But now I 'm going to shoot up my Rebif, get in warm jammies and socks to avoid the chils, and read a book till I go to sleep. taosdaphne######Question to MSNik, when you travel internationally, how do you count the days of the injection as you are loosing a day traveling east. And do you still inject at night before bed time? How do you calculate? thanks######Hi, SquirrelGirl! It would be great if you started a new thread to start your story, so it does n't get lost in (or hijack) story Rem's about drug choices. Do want to tell you though that ``benign MS '' is a very controversial phrase that a lot of doctors wo n't even use anymore. This disease is very unpredictable. Just to be clear, I am RRMS with very few sx and am not on drugs so it 's not like I 'm trying to scare you onto medication by saying this; I just believe it serves no purpose to perpetuate a myth; to imply that there 's some type of ``guarantee ''. Your doctor might say that my MS is ``benign '' but mine would say that I 'm RRMS but so far (except for maybe the one time that led me to my dx), the sx have been mild. Welcome to the board!######hi, just thought I would say that I have been on the copaxone for around 9 years. It 's not that bad at all. I have never had flu like symp. I dont have reactions at the injection site. The most I have had is a little bit of itching, which is only a couple of min. I would not go off my copaxone, course thats just me, everyone is different.The copaxone is subcutanius, whereas it just goes under the skin. It 's once a day, but so far I have made out pretty good. Good luck to you with making your decision.######I was just diagnosed with MS a few weeks ago after having a mild case of Optic Nurtitis. I also had an MRI that confirmed the MS. My Neurolgist suggested treatment. I have decided that Copaxone would work well with my lifestyle. (married, mother of two young children and work full-time) least side effects, and is safe. I am glad to hear that after 9 years it is working well for you that gives me hope. Thank you for sharing.######Hi, just wondering if you had any other symptoms before your Optic Neuritis. I am 44 yr old female just being diagnosed. My neuro suggested a spinal or lumbar puncture to determine if I need to start meds. We seem to have the same diagnosis `course ' as far as ON and MRI leading to the diagnosis. T in TN######Taos ｄｏ ｙｏｕ ａｌｗａｙｓ ｇｅｔ ｃｈｉｌｌｓ ？ what do they feel like?######slsmith1122, I used Rebiff 44 for two years and found lots of side effects including headache, increase in MS symptoms and an overall crappy feeling. I hear it depends on if you have relaps remitting or secondary progressive or primary progressive ms to determine how well Rebiff will work for you.######Rebif is only approved for relapsing remitting MS, so if you have any other form, its not likely to work for you, at all. I have RR MS and have been on Rebif for 3 years. Starting with over 50 lesions when i was diagnosed, I havent had one new one show up and Im getting Brain and Spine MRIs every 6 months. I also havent had any new symtoms. Not to say that I dont have terrible days- we all do- and at times, my original symtoms flare up and rage to the point of desperation- however I have learned what the triggers are. Stress, change of seasons, extreme humidity, even really rainy days can bring on my symtoms. I try to just be grateful for the good days and know the bad days will pass... Nikki######Me personally, I was not given the choice of drugs. I was put on Avonex and have been taking this shot for 3 years now. I still get the flu like symptoms even after all this time, some weeks better than others. I take the shot in the afternoon so I feel fine the next morning. I 'd rather only lose a half day instead of the entire one. The shot is painful and I probably would n't have gone in that direction had all my options been explained to me. I will say though that I quit taking the shot for 6 months and had a flare up. I also quit taking the shot for a couple of months another time and had another flare up. So, for me it 's working and I wo n't quit taking it. I have a 4 year old and I want to try to keep my attacks at a minimum for as long as I can. Good luck to you and keep writing on here. It 's a good group.######I originally started off taking Beta Seron, but unfortunately it stopped working for me so they switched me to Copaxone. I actually have a easier time with the Copaxone. I have memory issues, and I would have trouble staying on the right days to inject with the Beta Seron... with the Copaxone it 's a lot easier for me because I just take it at the same time every day and then there is no question as to if it 's been one day or two since my last shot... just food for thought..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

I have brain lesions and spine lesions. My lumbar came back fine. I refused treatment and went on with life. Last fall my lower back started hurting and I asked for a MRI of my lower back. It came back that I had a herniated disk with no lesions. I have always felt like it was more of a sciatica problem. Since it has been ignored my foot drops which causes unbalance. My doctor wants me to start the MS drugs but all the other tests still come back perfect. What do I do?######Well, first of all to have lesions in your lower back (spine) would not be the most common thing in the world. It does happen, but normally, MS lesions show up in the Cspine (up around the neck and brain stem). So, before doing anything, I would do two things. See an MS specialist- someone who will order the correct tests, or demand that your Neurologist orders a new set of MRIs both with and without contrast of your Brain, Cspine and Thoracic Spine AND Lumbar Spine. When you said the lesions were gone, had the MRI been done with and without contrast? If they are small, they might have been missed if contrast wasnt there... Your symtoms DO sound MS like and being on a DMD is the smartest thing you can do to prevent progression, but there is no right or wrong to this. Its very personal and only you can decide if the time is right to start doing the DMDs. However, before you even get to that decision, you should really have the rest of the spine and brain re-checked to see if there are lesions. Let us know if you have other questions. Nikki######I have lesions that have popped up as far down as my thoracic spine. I get nerve pain similar to sciatica. My pain starts in my lower back and spreads downward into my left thigh and causes pain throughout my thigh. I have not had an MRI since this pain has happened, but my neuro told me it was definitely MS related. I use a heating pad on my thigh at the point of greatest pain and then rotate the areas of pain. The heating pad has been the only thing that has worked for me.######Thank you so much for your comments. I have finally come to the reality that I do have MS. I do have an appointment with a MS specialist in Denver the 30 the of the month. My neurologist here wants me to start Rebif I am still a little hesitant but with the foot drop I know something needs to be done. I have been taking Tart Cherry Extract and the pain in the hip has disappeared. When they did the MRI of my lower back my doctor expected the pain was coming from lesions. There were no lesions but I did have a herniated disk. I do have lesions on my upper spine and there is something behind my left eye. This is why the doctors are sure of the MS diagnosis. Can I ask what type of drugs you are all on or have been on? I am so excited to get some others input. Thank you all so much.######For me, no drugs or meds. I use heat, cold compresses, acupressure, and rest depending on the area or extent of the pain. I get pain behind my right eye, but my use of polarized sunglasses has allowed me to avoid the pain which, for me, is related to light sensitivity. When I do have pain behind my right eye, acupressure has been the most help to me.######Have you ever had trouble walking? I am worried that if my left leg gets like my right I would be in a wheelchair.######I had numbness and tingling from the waist down and a right sided foot drop over 2 1/2 years ago (about 3 weeks after I started taking Copaxone.) When that happened I was put on IV solumedrol and the symptoms started going away almost immediatly. By 1 week-the foot drop was no longer noticible, though it took a couple of months to regain total strength, which I did by working out. I have been on copaxone for 2 years and 81/2 months. I 'm knocking on wood, but I have n't had any relapses since. I had optic neuritis at the time of diagnosis. My Neuro Opthamologist told me in August that my eye looks great and has pretty much completely recovered. My Neurologist (who has a large MS practice) said I am stable and that he 'd see me in 1 year instead of the usual 6 months (unless I have symptoms or concerns.) I 'm coming up on my 3 year anniversary since diagnosis on oct 3rd. When I was diagnosed, I thought alot about the what if's- what if I go blind-- what if I end up in a wheel chair. Try not to focus on the what if's. Take it a day at a time. You will adjust. Deciding what med's to go on is n't easy. I have been happy with Copaxone and my Neuro has had alot of success with his patient's taking the drug. Good luck to you. Hang in there.######My left leg has been dragging for over 2 years now, but it has gotten better as I have used the passive Exercycle. At present, my left leg drags when I get tired. I have gone from walking to bedridden and back to walking. I have used a power chair as a means of mobility and it remains in use when I need it. Otherwise, I have my cane and my service dog. As sodapopper said, do not worry about the what if's.######Tina, I am on Rebif... and I think its the greatest drug in the world. Ill be on it 5 years this fall... I was put on Copaxone when I was dx, however due to a severe allergic reaction, I only had 2 shots before I was switched. If you are interested in Rebif and how to ease into it, I have coached severall people here with tips and tricks to make it easier... feel free to search on my posts, as well as putting Rebif into the search engine on healthboards and reading what others have had to say... It does take up to 6 months for the drug to build up in your blood stream and during that time, I would have sworn it wasnt working and that my neuro was going to stop it at my 6 month checkup, however that wasnt the case. IN fact, once I hit 6 months, i have never had a relapse again! I do have bad days, and bad symtoms which will always be a part of my life. . but I work fulltime, go to Grad school fulltime, have 3 kids and live my life! Nothing, including Rebif, slows me down! I have not had a new lesion develop either, and I have over 50 of them in my brain and brainstem. So if Rebif is the direction you are being pointed, I would support that decision! Let me know if I can answer any of your questions... Nikki######I am self employed and really worry that I will be considered uninsurable or if I can get insurance what the cost will be. Have any of you had a problem qualifying for insurance? Also, what are the cost for the drugs? Right now with the insurance I have it will be 330.00 a month.######Tina, MSLifelines, the sponsor of Rebif guarantees that no one will ever pay more then 50$ per month for their supply of Rebif... I have excellent coverage and a great job and my co-pay was 100$ a month for the shot, but I still only pay 50$ per month! All you have to do is call MSlifelines and inquire about this... they will walk you thru how to qualify and its really easy. Its not about income, or need- its simply about your doc wanting you on the drug! Chin up! This is good news! As for the rest of the expenses, you will need blood work drawn quarterly the first year on the drug, then 2x a year after that. You will definately need a minimum of one MRI a year, my doc prefers I do it twice yearly. . and of course doctors office fees... other then that, unless you have any surprises, that should be pretty much it. Any other questions? nikki######Tina, My suggestion would be to contact the local chapter of the MS society. They will educate you. You can research the various ms drugs and you and your doctor can make the correct decision for you. I started out on Avonex but found I could n't tolerate the side effects of the interferons. I started Copaxone in 2007 and am very happy with it. I just had my yearly MRI and it came back stable, no change from last yr. So the meds can make a difference. But the choice is yours to make Good luck######Nikki, I did get a letter from MSlifelines. I have an appointment the end of the month with the specialist in Denver. I think I know the answer he will give me and I am ready to be rid of the pain and have a somewhat normal life again. You have lifted a huge burden from me. I need to ask a question. When I asked the neurologist if Refib would stop the progression of MS she said ``yes. '' I take it I have a non progressive type of MS if there is such a thing. Will this halt or slow the progression? In the 11 years since diagnosis I have tried to ignore and have n't learned much about this disease.######Tina, none of the DMDs are actually approved for any type of MS except relapsing-remitting, although many neurologists and studies are pointing towards the ability to use the drugs for some of the more progressive types of MS. So, we have to assume that you have R/R MS (as do I). Will it stop progression? There is no guarantee. However, there is a significant amount of research and study that state clearly that Rebif is the strongest of the DMDs (disease modifying drugs) and it has the highest rate of slowing down progression with respect to no new MRI activity (no new lesions mean no new symtoms or relapses!) also, the highest rate of stopping new attacks or lesions from forming. That being said, its really up to you whether or not you feel its worth injecting 3 times a week... in my opinion, ANYTHING was worth trying to stop progression! And, that being said, Im living proof that for many of us, it does. I wont lie to you... the first month is easy. the second and third month (because you titrate the drug, starting at the lowest amount and working your way up to full dosage- 44mcgs) are pretty rough. Many people who claim they cant handle the side effects dont give them enough time to wear off. Honestly, by month 4, the side effects are gone for most people... and you only should have them the nights you inject and they should be gone in 6-8 hours. I never missed a day of school, work or my life while dealing with the side effects, you just have to learn to manage them... and MSlifelines will help you! (so will I!) . There are some other worries with starting an interferon, your liver enzymes might spike for a few weeks, thats normal, and normally your neuro will repeat the blood work in 5 weeks and they will be back to normal; however not everyone tolerates the Interferons the same way. I couldnt tolerate copaxone !! I had severe breathing problems and almost died on my second shot of the stuff! So im glad you are going to meet with the company... ask me whatever you would like to ask, so you are prepared with questions before you get there... and i wish you lots of luck. I remember exactly how scary it was to start injecting myself and being on a drug like this... but 5 years later, its a piece of cake and Im really glad I started it! Nikki######Thanks so much for all the advice everyone. I am actually looking forward to visiting with the specialist on the 30th. I have spent 11 yrs being able to ignore the fact... but now I am ready to deal with it. I am thankful that I have went this long with minimal problems. Ready to deal with the problem and I am not scared. I do n't know if this would have been possible without all the insight, thank you!######What an inspirational message sodapopper. I am 5 months into copaxone and have finally stopped stressing about the blindness, deafness, wheel chair, vertigo etc.. This week was work stress and I felt extra dizzy and ``off ''... glad the drug is working. It sounds like the welts etc never do improve though do they? I went to my first copaxone sponsored luncheon and some folks were saying how they still get the welts after several years.######Niki, why do n't I see those stats on rebif as you 're quoting. It seems like each drug has their stats that sound so compelling. I am not questioning your accuracy but am wondering why did n't I select rebif. It was n't even offered to me. it was avonix or copaxone. I believe, as I 've been told, that the important thing is to be on some type of drug and they are all effective generally speaking.######Jodi H- Thank you! Life does go on, does n't it !? AS for the welts-- When I first started on the drug, I would get a welt at the injection site. Month by month they got better for me. It is a very rare occasion that I get a welt now. Really, months in between. If I do n't inject deep enough, and go in at too much of an angle, then I would be more apt to get one. As far a pain- sometimes it 's a bad bee sting, and sometimes I barely feel anything. Hopefully the welts will improve for you too.######Using DMD is a personal choice. I 'm on Avonex and started it when I was dx in 06 '. My neuro started me with this because it 's once a week. If the Avonex did n't control the activity he would start Rebif because it is giving more frequently. But here's where I 'm suspect of all of these drugs... many people have their initial exacerbation (s) and then go years without another one. How do you know if the drugs are slowing the disease or if it 's your ``normal '' course of disease? I guess I was n't willing to take the chance... that 's why I 'm on Avonex. Also, I follow the Swank diet (pretty loosely) for the same reasons. I do n't want to end up immobile wondering if it would have made a difference. I want to know that I did everything I could. Good luck with your choice!######Jodi, The information is there, but unfortunately, I cant publish it here. You have to seek out the clinical trials for Rebif in order to find them on your own. Rebif is the strongest of the DMDs with the most impressive record of reducing MRI activity and lesions... however, some Neuros will NOT start a person on Rebif, because if Copaxone or Avonex stop working, it gives the doctor another avenue to pursue... for me, the next step would be Tysabri or one of the newer, less tested drugs... reason I was put on Rebif was the 50 + lesions on my brain when first dx and the severe onset of symptoms which I had. Im not one of the fortunate ones who had a lesion or two... i also have substantial black holes in my brain... places where I once had lesions and the brain tissue no longer supports them, so instead of the MRI showing ``white spots '' I actually have both white spots (lesions) and black holes... missing brain matter! I always say its a good thing i was blessed with an above average IQ to begin with! Black holes or not, Im still a 4.0 student with 3 degrees!

My only symptoms was constant fatigue, a week of double vision in one eye and my legs felt tired. When the brain MRI came back they said I 've probably had it for years? and I have one active lesion currently. I do n't recall any problems prior in the past years. My problem is, I have over thought the meds and now I 'm afraid to move ahead and start one of them. The doctor gave me the list, told me to read up on them and decide. Well, that has been a double edged sword for me, I go from Copaxone, to Avonex, to holistic. I 'm not afraid of needles, I 'm fearful of the side effects and some of the bad reactions I 've read about. I do n't really have anyone to talk to me about this and when I try to read side by side drug comparisons they are either wrote up by the drug company or they say different things. Or when I try to find out which one has a better track record, again, I find different things. Can you start out on lower doses? Does that help ease into it? Did/Does anyone else have this problem in deciding on the medication? Guess I 'm just on info overload.######HI Brenda. You DO have information overload. I feel for you, I remember what it was like, and it was only a year ago. The thing you should know about all MS Meds is that they dont cure you, or even fix what ails you; however the are designed to prevent relapses, reduce MRI activity (no new lesions) and with that, reduce the chances of new symtoms... new lesions = new symtoms, to avoid that is half the battle. I am on Rebif. I started it exactly a month after being dx and Im so happy I did. IN the past year, no new activity on my MRI- no new lesions- no real symtoms, although I will admit to having had a major relapse the first 3 months into the meds (this would have happened anyway). IT takes about 6 months for ANY MS drug to really start working, so during that time- you might experience side effects or even a relapse. happens to most of us... To address your question, I do know that Rebif is a titration. What that means is that the first box you recieve (keep in mind you do Rebif 3 times a week) is the lowest dose. Then, you move to the next (middle) dose and then the regular or full strength dose. This IS supposed to ease your body into being used to the medicine and reduce side effects. I can honestly say the first month- no side effects at all. At the middle dose, some flu like symtoms occured, however they only lasted about 4 hours. Then at full dose, more flu like symtoms occured which lasted 6-8 hours (3 times a week). It was about this time someone told me to take 1 aleve, instead of 2 tylenol pre-shot. I started this and BOOM! No more side effects. 4 months into the drug, I stopped taking the Aleve-- and Ive never had another side effect! My body got used to the interferon. Also you should know Rebif has the smallest needle on the market, it is prefilled, you do nothing other than inject it. It can be used with an autoinjector or simply by using the sryinge. i do both, depending on what area. . Now, Rebif and Avonex are the identical drug... the Avonex is injected only once a week, and into the muscle. They brought Rebif out because some patients complained that by the end of the week, they had drug withdraw... felt like it was ``time for a shot ''. By doing Rebif 3 times a week you never experience that. Betaseron was brought out first- also an interferon, its slightly different. Patients who started on Betaseron ususally stay on it, until such a time when it is no longer strong enough to be working for them... and Copaxone. The only synthetic drug for MS. ITs not like the interferons. No one ever gets flu like symptoms from this, however many injection site reactions seem to be the major complaint... the downside- you have to inject it daily. I hope this helps just alittle with thinking about it. If you want more feedback, do a search on healthboards, using each individual name of each drug... youll read all sorts of posts on people's opinions... What I would like to point out to you, is that taking an MS drug or not, is a matter of personal choice. In my own opinion, its the only thing I can do which controls MS from progressing. I think of it as controlling MS, and not letting MS control me. My doctor told me the sooner you get on a drug, the less chance of progression you 'll have, and that was enough for me. HOwever, with that said, I do know of a few people who are not on any MS medication at all, and are doing really well at this time... so, its a very personal choice. Good luck and let us know if we can help you any more with this! Nikki######I had the same decision to make oct of this year. I have been on the Rebif for about 2 months. I started the Max dose about a month ago. So far I feel I made the right choice for a couple of reasons. Just like you I am not too fond of needles. The needles that you use with Rebif is smaller than the rest. I do n't seem to feel it now. It is 3 times a week which is less often except than avonex. I live in Strongsville which close to you. Are you seeing a specalist. I am seeing Dr Westbrook out of University. He 's beeen studying MS for 42 years. This is a great board and a lot of great knowledge to be shared. Take care and remember your not alone.######Hello Brenda. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society has a very helpful section for comparing the drugs...... I do n't use the Disease Modifying Drugs (DMDs) but I was diagnosed before any were available and have just choosen to do without. Good luck in your decision.######Hi, Brenda. Like you, my dx in March of '07 hit me out of the blue and an eye condition (which turned out to be Optic Neuritis) brought me to the doctor. None of the lesions in my brain were active so based on this and my history, they also think I 've had this for a long time. I was experiencing other sx during that time (all sensory, like tingling, etc.) but nothing that made me think I need to go to the doctor-- or at least nothing that made me wonder if I had Multiple Sclerosis! As far as history, there 's nothing really that made me think MS although in retrospect, learning more about possible sx, it 's possible that there were things that could have been attributable to it. It 's somewhat ironic because we were dxed quickly and yet you 'll read stories upon stories from people who are experiencing a lot more sx on a regular basis who ca n't get a dx. I decided to not go on DMDs and treat holistically instead. That said, I 'm not saying I 'll never go on them but hope I do n't have to face that decision. Because I 've decided to take to not do DMDs (disease modifying drugs, sometimes now called DMTs, the ``t '' standing for therapy or therapies), we 're keeping a close watch and I am about to do my second round of MRIs. Everyone is different in terms of their reactions to drugs or lack thereof. I do n't agree that no one has experienced flu like sx with Copaxone and I have learned with this disease that it 's hard to say ``never '' where is concerned! Everyone's disease is different too. Some people do well without DMDs and some do n't. Even with the DMDs, any honest doctor will tell you that they just do n't really know. At this point in time, they can say what the evidence ``shows '' but in terms of using the word ``prove ''? Almost impossible to know if what the MRIs show (or do n't show) is a result of the therapy. I 'm not saying they do n't work but there is really just no way of knowing for. That said, I do believe that this disease needs attention and all of us have to find our weapon to fight, whether it be a DMD or complimentary medicine and diet. As Snoopy suggested, I would go to the NMSS site to do a comparison of available drugs. If you decide to go on one, you can always change your mind-- no decision, to use the DMDs or not use them, has to be forever. I wish you the best of luck with whatever you decide.######I was also diagnosed in March, 7th exactly. I have right side numbness Walk with a cane), loss of color right eye, fatigue and memory problems. I started on copaxone and had a worse MRI 20-25 lesions 7 months later, so we stwitched to Rebif and have been on it for 3 months. I exacerbate every 30-60 days now and hav ehad 5 steriod treatments this year, the last 2 were 7 days of Solumedrl. I have 2 kids, 6 and 3. Dawn######25 years of zero meds for me. That is a choice mad long ago. My doctor told me on my last visit that ``No Meds works well for you ''. Make your decision for yourself first. No matter your decision, you will find love and support here. I will remember you in my prayers.######Thank you all for your replys, It does help to talk. Rebif was another one that I was looking into. One day, it 's this drug, then I change my mind, then I go to something else, hopefully I 'll quit procrastinating and decide on whatever. I do know I have a terrible diet and was reading ``The MS Recovery Diet '' and knowing that it does n't help what I 'm eating now. I think my diet and the huge amount of stress this past year set it all in motion. (or made it worse because I never knew I had it before). If anything, it ca n't hurt me to start eating right so that is one thing I can decide to move forward on and the exercise. (I hear yoga is great- if can sit still and relax long enough) I did go to the clinic, but I found the neurologists no different in details than the one I have now. I guess that I had expected a little more detail into my options but then again maybe one would have to go back a few times? It was just my first visit. I just did n't hear they would handle things any different than the guy I go to now, which I guess is good. But I probably will just stick with my neurologist closer to home. I have no complaints with him. He is to the point but not to where he scares you. (If you only knew the opti-neurologist who actually diagnosed me and how he presented it to me, you 'd would have thought I was a lost cause and doomed) It has always been interesting that here in the US you do n't hear many doctors saying anything about alternative treatments, but I have a friend in Sweden and she said the the doctors and even the vets are all trained in both. I guess I 'll see my neurologist again and hopefully take in some more information and get deciding already on something. Thanks for the information and help !!!!.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

I was diagnosed with MS in 2006 and was started on Rebif. I stopped taking it in Sept. 2011 due to horrible injection site reactions and feeling that it did n't do anything for me. I 'm now seeing an alternative treatment neuro and am thinking about asking him to write me a prescription for LDN. I 'd be interested to hear any/all comments on their experience with LDN and is it difficult to get your neuro to prescribe it for you?######Welcome! Because LDN is not approved for MS and must be used ``off-label '' (many MSers do use it), the difficulty is finding a neuro he is willing to write you the prescription. Then you will have to find a pharmacy to provide it. It is not impossible, but it is not ``easy-peasy ''.######Hi there. I am on LDN. I have been on it for over 2 years now. I was on Rebif for 5 years, have been on Copaxone, Tysabri, Gilenya and a few others- Ive developed antibodies to ALL of them and can not take any of them. I have zero problems with LDN. In order to convince your doctor to prescribe LDN for you, you need to be really informed. Im going to tell you to investigate Skips Pharmacy in Boca Raton Florida; there is a ton of info available through Skip, which will help you with this. I get my LDN mail ordered from his pharmacy every 90 days. Because I was well informed, when I made a case with my doctor, he decided that he would allow me to do this. LDN is inexpensive as well. It costs about 30$ per month. Since starting LDN, most of my symptoms are non existent. I no longer have bladder urgency or constipation issues. My neuropathy (numbness/ tingling) has lessened considerably, I havent had Optical Neuritis in the past few years (I had several issues with this prior), I have much more energy and I feel terrific. Now, the downside is, that I also have new lesions. Each MRI that I have had, has shown new lesions, which is terrifying- BUT I feel terrific. I have zero clinical symptoms... Most neurologists who have examined me have actually decided that the LDN is what is keeping me so stable- there is no other explanation because the amount of lesions I have should make me in much worse shape. Let me know what else you want to know about the drug. Nikki######Hi Debi, I 'm curious why your considering ldn and not tysabri or copaxone ??? Are u having a relapse now? I 'm considing copaxone and ldn my neuro said he would prescribe it for me but because of my lesion load and amount of active lesions he wants me to start tysabri but I 'm to afraid, so i think I 'm gon na do the Copaxone. Right now I 'm in a second ON flare but avonex and rebif failed me I have n't had a flare in 7 yrs and have to call him tomorrow with my decision... Keep us posted what you decide######I do n't want to use ANY of the DMD out there for MS. I am more interested in alternative treatment. When I was diagnosed I was diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS. I do n't understand WHY because I have had symtoms that NEVER go away and just get worse every years. Rebif did NOTHING for me. I have a first cousin who is taking Copaxone. She was diagnosed 2 years ago and does n't like to talk about it. I know there were issues with Tysabri when I was first diagnosed and it was taken off the market because of the fact that people had died. I just want to treat my symptoms. The pain in my feet is SO bad. I have that feeling of the ``MS hug '' ALL the time. My legs are extremely heavy feeling. These things never go away and only get worse. If I could find something to help me get some relief, I would welcome it.######If you have had symptoms that never go away, you should not be diagnosed as RRMS. My symptoms do not go away and have not since at least 1982 (when I really noticed and took action). Since MS types were created, I have fallen into Progressive. If you are progressive, there are no DMDs. I treat myself with trigger avoidance, my dark chocolate and my Diet Dr. Pepper, along with eating carefully (trigger avoidance), stretching, low impact exercise (keep moving- walking is my main exercise), much prayer, and much reading, and staying optimistic and counting my blessings.######. '' SO NOT TRUE! I have symtoms that never went away. I have relapsing remitting MS. When a nerve is permanently destroyed, a symptom may never go away. For me, its the numbness and tingling in my hand/ fingers. It will NEVER go away until they can find a way to regenerate nerve damage (and they are working on it). Ive lived with this for 8 years now. BUT... with the taking of LDN, it is lessened. I think that LDN is a terrific choice for you. Having been on Rebif, Copaxone, Tysabri and others, I can tell you that nothing has made me FEEL better than LDN. Its safe, its cheap, it has zero side effects- and it does help with symptom management. In Australia and Europe, its approved for MS therapy... Relapsing Remitting MS does not mean that symptoms come and go, it means that additional flare ups can come and go... some symptoms are here to stay- and this doesnt mean you are progressing, or that you dont have R/R... it simply means that you have nerve damage. I wish you the very best in your choice, as one who has used LDN for years now, I say give it a whirl! Nikki######My statement is true from my definition. A symptom brought on by a permanent disabling attack, to me, is just that- disabling. If you experience a variety of symptoms without any 30 day break, then I would call this progressive. These are my non-medical opinions. I would maintain that it does not appear to me that meds are having any effect in her case. I would encourage a fresh medical opinion to try to resolve the issue.######Msjay ur such an inspiration (med free) thanks for your posts as well as msnik on the other spectrum (meds) of been there tried that drug Debi I do go to a herbalist (idiologist) sp? she said ms is the hardest illness to treat herb (natural) wise because some of the combinations can put you into a relapse, right now she has me on just the basics that my ms spec agreed its ok to take he actually raised my d3 dose. Believe me I hate to take any medication and like you would prefer med free... I wo n't see my herbalist til feb and she will shake her head and see poison in my system since I did n't call her about my ON and 2 series of solumedrol she will try to detox me from that I 'm sure! My relapses are sensory and I 'm sorry your going through this and I say go for it try the ldn you can always stop it if it does n't work it 's worth a try gl######In many parts of Asia you get a prescription to take to either an herbal pharmacy or a regular pharmacy. Herbs can do many things which can be from nothing to totally weird to fatal. Just like a pharmaceutical, it is best to let the doctor know what you are taking. My grandmother lived to 98 and only used an herbal pharmacy- she was ``old school '' As Mr. Spock said it so well: ``Live long and Prosper ''######Just to clarify- the types of MS are differentiated by very specific characteristics. With Relapsing Remiting MS, there are periods of flare ups or which may or may not completely resolve; symptoms may be from mild to severe; however patients with relapsing/remitting MS are not in constant states of flareups (or excaberations). The disease does not continue to decline regularly. With any type of progessive MS, symptoms will steadily worsen over time. There may or may NOT be periods of remission. The key to having a progressive state of MS is that symptoms will continue to worsen over time, there will be a steady progression of disability and eventually new attacks will stop, as there will not be periods of remission. Instead they are replaced by constant worsening of the disease. What this means is that when a patient has On the other hand, if a patient has continuing worsening of the disease, (not to be confused with one symtom which never goes away) continued symptoms, no days of remission, Progressive MS has started. At this point in time, there are no drugs for progressive MS.... the drugs, like Rebif, Copaxone Tysabri and even LDN are supposed to prevent progression in the sense that they are supposed to prevent new attacks (new symptoms). IF they work, people can live forever without progressing... it doesnt mean that their original symtoms will be fixed. Disease Modifying Drugs are not designed to fix symptoms. LDN appears to be the only drug on the market which actually does help with symptom management. It has proven properties for pain relief, neuropathic relief and even energy increase- via the endorphins which are triggered when taking LDN at night. When a patient hits a more progressive state of their disease, at this time, nothing is available to slow down the onset of the progression. . no drugs are available to stop the progression. Drugs may be prescribed to treat the symptoms, but they are not disease modifying drugs. Rememer that two things are important when clarifying the state of the disease, the number of lesions a patient has means nothing.... whether or not a symptom resolves means nothing... however, new symptoms, the amount of new flare ups which take place over a year AND the periods in between when a patient has nothing new taking place, are what differentiates R/R from SP MS. Im a good example. My onset to discovering I had MS was numbness. It was classic ``pinched nerve '' or ``Carpal Tunel '' type symtoms, which my doctors were sure I had... test after test showed I had all the classic MS symptoms including over 50 lesions in my brain... I also experienced balance and heat sensitivity issues for years, but had no idea what they were. Ive had numb fingers and hand for 8 years. In all that time, Ive been on 5 different DMDs. Ill never regain use of my fingers or hand; however I am 100% definately Relapsing/remitting. I havent missed a day of work, or had a new symptom in over 7 years. Ive had bouts of optical neuritis when I first started disease modifying drugs, but not since. And, I havent had a single new symptom in all this time. Ive had more remitting than actual relapsing over the course of my disease thus far. Just because I still have numb fingers, I am still very definately relapsing/remitting MS.

I have also been reading about those who do not do meds at all. I guess the first thing that popped out is its a crap shoot either way and its my decision. My question: If you DO NOT do the meds, what do you do when you have symptoms? Since main symptom onset in January, they have continually got worse and many additional ones have been added. I had one month where almost everything went away and the heavy fatigue released. I ``almost '' felt totally back to normal. If I do not take dmd's is there anything to combat this fatigue? It makes me feel absolutely lousy, worthless for getting anything accomplished. I can deal with numb limbs and finding that redline and not crossing it, now that I know what all this side pain is, and the muscle spasms, I can deal with those. But this fatigue and feeling like it takes everything in me to get up and take a shower, to then feel the need to go back to bed is ridiculous and I ca n't seem to get thru that... any suggestions. Do dmd's help with that too or something else? or do dmd's just try to keep you from getting into a relapse to begin with? thanks!######I am so glad you posted this as i am awaiting my first appointment with ms specialist in dec an if i am dx for sure i would like to know also the benefits of dmd or not. Have had a multitude of symptoms this past year. I get some breaks an as you i can live with the pain. I have noticed i get horrible dizzy spells when its hot or humid or even have an extra blanket on. Also anxiety that was coming at odd times even before ms was mentioned. I have always been sensitive to meds allergic to aspirin so im kinda afraid of.the meds. So it would be great to get some info on how diffrent poeple handle an make there decisions.thanks for starting this thread. Tami######Hi, Late as it is, I could not sleep as I zonked out for several hours earlier today. DMD's DO NOT ELIMINATE SYMPTOMS. Even with DMD's you will still experience symptoms. The DMD's are supposed to slow the progress of the MS, but it is not always successful. You can be on DMDs and still progress. If you want to battle symptoms alone, there are meds for that. I have found that avoiding the avoidable triggers is the best for me. When you can not avoid a trigger, rest and recover. Stretch every day and stay well hydrated helps with muscles.######I think you can count on this as a trigger for you. When I sleep at night I have a sheet and 2 different blankets. I will shed and add layers as needed. Heat and humidity are major triggers for many MSers.######As a person who has been on several different DMDs I would like to share my story. I was put on Copazone immediately upon my dx. I was allergic to it and within 3 shots was told ``no more ''. I stopped breathing twice... I was then switched to Rebif. If you look at my old posts, you will see that I was a HUGE fan of Rebif for almost 5 years. It kept me stable. Did I still get smptoms? Yes. I even experienced Optical Neuritis twice in the first six months on Rebif and thought for sure they would take me off of it... it was then, that I learned it really does take 6 months to build up in your blood stream. Rebif was tough in the second, third and fourth month. I did get the flu like symptoms. I felt horrible 2 hours after my shot and laid on the bathroom floor many times wishing I was dead. BUT it only lasts for about 8 hours post injection and only on shot nights (3 times a week). I managed to stay in school, work fulltime and raise my 3 kids without ever missing a day.... then one day, the symtoms stopped. No more nauseau and flu like symtoms. It took about 30 shots to get to that point. (remember, its 12 shots a moth). I stayed on Rebif almost 5 years and had MRIs every 6 months... they were stable and it was ``working '' to keep the disease from progressing. Then one day, I saw a spot on my arm, strange... but it looked like melanoma. 3 others showed up on my back... I saw a Dermatolgost who informed me these needed to be surgically removed... calling my Neuro, he informed me that its a very rare side effect of any interferon. And he ordered blood wok... it was determined that I had developed antibodies to the Interferon and it was actually making me sick... over that prior year, I had been sick quite often. Infections, fevers, feeling like my head wasnt connected to my body. I was finishing my second bachelors degree at this point, taking my first management job, and people were telling me they were seeing personality changes. I didnt like myself and I constantly felt cognitively foggy... I stopped the Rebif immediately and went through a total of 7 skin surgeries. . within 6 months, I felt like myself again. I started researching meds. I discovered LDN. Low dose Naltrexone is used in Europe and Australia as a DMD for MS.. . but in the US, its not approved, even though the drug is used for other reasons and FDA approved. I read everything I could get my hands on and eventually convinced my doctor to let me try it. You have to get it compounded by a specialty pharmacy and its very inexpensive. (25$ a month). It helped with ALL of my symtoms. My bladdrer urgency, my sleeplessness... and especially my fatigure. I have never felt better in my entire life! However, 10 months later, I had another MRI and discovered that I have 20 new lesions... WIth this, my doctor insisted that I try another DMD. I am JC Virus positive, the idea of trying Tysabri was terrifying, but he said ``lets try it. No one has ever gotten PML with less than a year of infusions '' by that time, Gilenya will be available... so I tried Tysabri. first infusion, no problem. Second infusion, a rash and itching all over my body, which was treated with benedryl also infused in the veins... third infusion, I spent 2 days in the hospital as I stopped breathing. No more Tysabri. Im back to only taking LDN. He then said they reformulated Copaxone. Lets try it again. One shot and I was in the ER for 8 hours... not able to breathe. Then came Gilenya, One pill and I broke out in a rash all over my body and said ``NO WAY ''. Im not going to put my body through more allergic reactions. So, fast forward... ive had one heck of a year... and through it all I finished my MBA, started my doctoral (post graduate program) and also travel for my job as a Regional Manager... I have over 70 lesions and I absolutely feel terrific. To see me, you would not know I have MS.... but I still have numbness and tingling in my hands and fingers. My feet go numb now and then. I have some residual damage to my eye from ON- but I fake it with the best of them! I do not complain. I do not let a bad day stop me. I go to the gym 4 days a week for 45 minutes, which helps significantly with balance and stretching- and keeps me feeling good... I also try to eat right. Ive now had MS for about 8 years (at least Ive been dx that long). Today is thanksgiving and my birthday! Im grateful for the fact that im still mobil and independent. Im grateful that im able to pass along my experience to others. So the big question is: To do DMDs or not? Yes. Try them. You wont know unless you try... and its insurance. There is significant proof that taking anything which helps slow down the progression of the disease is worthwhile. There are 3 new drugs in the pipleine to be released in 2013. Will I try them? yes. BG12 is looking positive. The drug is safe, been used for years for Psoriasis... and it appears to be slowing down progession in radiographical tests (MRIs) and in symtoms. I have no doubt that Ill try it when its available. And, in the meantime, I do what I can to not let this disease control me, but I control the disease! BUT, anyone who is recently dx, should consider trying anything they can not to let this disease progress. I am living proof that its not the number of lesions which equates progression, but Im the excetion to the rule. My case is being studied all over the country by neurologists trying to figure out how my brain stem can be so damaged, but my brain is actually fine... why can I walk? Breathe? Think so clearly? No one has an expanation... but for this and more- I am grateful. I wish all of you newbies better luck than I have had with some of the DMDs, but I would never tell you not to try them. It is a very personal choice, but doing nothing, when you have options, seems like a bad idea to me. Hugs and happy thanksgiving to all of you Nikki######HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Nikki !!!######Thank you for all the info! I have read thru some of your older posts and glad to have the updated version. I am trying to see if my tried and true ``let it run its course '' such as I have lived with sinus infections, colds, fevers, and past minor illness would equate to this. I am not sure for me. This is not ``just a cold ''. But it appears, just as with other over the counter meds, the side effects may outweigh the benefit-for me. The other side is the counter-intuitive notion that I can ``do nothing '' AND feel empowered by that. (And by nothing I am not putting down non-med people- I am referring to ``doing nothing with dmd's '' in this instance). I certainly understand this seems like the work of management with or without meds. My next follow-up with my neuro is Monday and the next week I attend the speaking engagement so I am looking forward to hearing his view on it all and gaining valuable information. Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving and Happy Birthday Nikki######As you go into anything unknown, if you have armed yourself with all the info available, then nothing should take you by surprise. You might use the meeting as an opportunity to ask many questions of those who are supposed to be ``in the know ''. Play the sponsors off of one another and you might hit a treasure trove of info.######I have already pretty much decided NOT to use DMDs if I do indeed get an MS diagnosis. The side effects and risks seem far too great for me and I do n't really care to make the pharmaceutical companies richer unnecessarily. Do n't get me wrong, I do take medications for other health issues that I have but only at a minimum. Not to say that I might not get to a point where I will try ``anything '' but as of right now, this is my plan.######Hi, I am one who totally thinks you should be on them. It haults your flares and is known to slow the progression of the disease. When I was first dx, I could not get on them fast enough. I had MS for seven years before my dx and had a doctor that dismissed my symptoms and said it was something else. But one year, those symptoms lasted weeks longer and I also had the fatigue you described. I then went to a different doctor who ordered a MRI and got my dx. Two months after starting the ms therapy all my symptoms that I would have each year dissappeared for years. I ca n't say if it was because of the therapy but these symptoms would come every year and then stopped once I was on them. There is also medications to help with fatigue. But all med's have side effects and can cause other health issues. It all depends on what quality of life you are living with now and if you think it is the right choice for you.######Hi Tami, my first symptom was vertigo. I also have always had anxiety. I hope you are not dx with MS. But if you are there are several therapies out there. If one causes you problems, than switch to another one. My first therapy was Avonex. It did give me flu symptoms but I stayed on it for a year. I got tired of spending my weekends not feeling well. I then went on Betaseron and that one at first made me really depressed and it took me four months half dose to get used to it and was put on Lexapro to help with the depression. I was then able to stay on it full dose for two years. But it did comprimise my liver and had to stop it. I have now been on Copaxane for four years. It has never affected my mood but does give me site reactions but are an annoyance only. I went to a seminar that had 5 neurologists from the Cleveland Clinic. They said to stay away from the new MS therapies until they have been on the market for a minimum of one to two years. They are just to new to know what kind of health issues they can cause. Plus, some of them are killers to your liver, more so, than the therapies that have been on the market for years. Every person has different reactions to all med's. If one med does not work for you, try another. I am a very strong believer in trying to slow the progression of this monster disease. When you are RRMS a lot of people can work, exercise and stay very active (like me). It is when you have the disease for twenty years and it moves into the secondary progressive form is when it starts affecting your life (how I am now). I read that 80% of people with RRMS will become Secondary Progressive. So if you can slow the progression down, I say do it. Hopefully, in the near future they can either find a cure, or learn how to repair nerve damage.######Hi and everyone, thanks for the birthday wishes! I just wanted to mention, take a look at LDN (low Dose Naltrexone). There are zero side effects. Its so inexpensive, that no one makes any money off of it, and its biggest advantage is the reduction in fatigue. I am still on this. . and will not allow my doctor to take me off of it. There is a pharmacist in Boca Raton Florida who is a leader in MS/LDN research. You can read up on him Dr. Skip and LDN. THis might be the one drug you really do want to explore... and because it is NOT approved at this time in the US by the MS Society (could it be because there is no money to be made off it?) its not something youll EVER hear anyone talk about unless you go to Europe. It has made a serious positive impact on me. Skips Pharmacy has a ton of info worth reading. Hugs, Nikki######Hi- October was my 5 year anniversary of my MS diagnosis. Jan 1st will be my 5 year anniversary of being on Copaxone. Knock on wood- but I have n't had a relapse in almost 5 years. February will be my 5 yr anni for that- and I hope I make it and continue to do so well. At the time of diagnosis I had optic neuritis followed by numbness and tingling from the waist down, followed by a drop foot. Fortunately i recovered from all of the above quite fast. I had to be treated with steroids for the numbness and leg issue, but from there- no problems. I 'm not sure if it is the Copaxone keeping me stable or not. I will never opt for the no medication approach until there is no option. Fight it with everything there is. That is just my opinion.######I think the most concern is being so tired. I completed hundreds of tax returns for the 2011 year and had a man come in last week (obviously filing late) and once I completed that one return, took a nap on my desk because I felt I had just written an entire thesis or something. While my boss is very understanding, not being able to do that task is not acceptable. My brain feels like its absolutely being strained when I concentrate. That is what I really want to change! The answer to how best to deal with that would certainly be the route I want to take... A question: Since my main symptom onset in January I have only been without all this for one month. So for 10 out of 11 months I have been in the fog and dealing with crazy. I read about relapses lasting for 2 weeks to 6 months. How about 9 months? My first one was 9 months. Does that correlate to the future in any way? I guess I will get this info on Monday from my neuro but man this is getting old because i am being forced to find a new normal, which is totally opposite of who I have been in the past. (As far as energetic, volunteering, helping with my kids schoolwork- now its ``go to sleep ''.)######There is no textbook example. You could be experiencing a cascade effect of one problem after another. In 2002 when I finally took disability, it was at least 6-7 months of non-work mental rest before I could feel the fog lifting. I pushed myself for a month before taking disability, but things only worsened and I knew I had to break. You might see if you can take a medical leave and rest your mind. I know that when I was teaching math to my youngest, the higher levels we studied, the more exhausted I became. I would take an hour to 2 hour nap before afternoon lessons. Your fatigue is something which will (should- knock on wood) lift. You might see about a mental rest before and after tax season which should allow you to continue to work.######BTW, ADA accommodation rules could benefit you. A reasonable accommodation might allow you to work from home where you could work and nap as needed. My brother has a secretary with MS who has to take extended leave (usually in the summer). She has been doing this for over 10 years now while keeping her employment.######Thank you. That is some great information. I could complete these at home... my husband even suggested that because it seems I perk up at night time (the 2-3 hour afternoon naps help with this I am sure). It has just never been done this way at my office so I am not sure how that would go over. But the majority I complete are drop-offs and not appointments. I just keep praying I can figure this out within the next 6-8 weeks and not have to do something like that. Whoever thought at 32 I would be thinking of changing my WHOLE life? I know it will work out. Thank you for your knowledge and making me feel better######Happy belated birthday Nikki and thanks for posting your experiences (you been thru almost all) and the courage to never give up !!!! I was finally diagnosed after years and years of sensory symptoms when I finally got diagnosed in O4 ' I decided to do nothing for one year. I had 2 numb hands and l'hermittes sign, a year later I still had active lesions but my symptoms were gone, since I still had several active lesions I decided to start avonex. I was on it for 2years still had active lesions with no symptoms so obviously Avonex was n't doing its job (stopping the# of active lesions) I then switched to Rebif which kept me lesion and active free for 3 years until February I had new active lesions along with more spots, still symptom free, when I say symptom free I mean no flairs but I still have my forever symptom of being tired and ran over after I do something but if this was the least of my symptoms I can handle it. No symptoms with active lesions until 5 wks ago I was at work and thought I was getting a migraine with visual disturbance I quick took 6 Advil I never got the headache but my vision never cleared. I worked out of one eye for 3 wks i called my neuro (not an ms specialist) and went for another MRI which showed several active and new lesions my mris from the 90's always showed to many lesions to count! I Went to the eye Dr it was optic neuritis I have NEVER took prednisone for any sensory flair over the years (numb hands, numb face etc) I always waited for it to subside on its own taking 6 months 9 months and a yr and a half for symptoms to go away but this time I needed my vision and could n't wait this one out. I decided to do 5 days 500mg solu-medrol 9 days later my vision starts focusing clearer stil not perfect but massive improvement !!!!! I saw the ms specialist on Wednesday who told me although my neuro check is 100% I stil have way too much action, he said rebif has failed me. Now my options are to stop rebif and try copaxone or tysabri (going to test for the virus) I 'm afraid of tysabri and copaxone does n't excite me either. I said what if I do nothing he said my job is to keep you out of a wheelchair in ten years he said with all the active lesions its not something you want to sit on !!!!!!! I think I will try the lesser of the two evils first that being copaxone and if that fails me ill try tysabri !!! I want to wait for bg12 but he suggest I not wait til March because the FDA might not approve it again since it was due to be approved December !!!!!!! So to treat or not to treat that is the question !!!!! I never want to see like I did and I truly feel I should try something but what? The goal is to stop the action rebif did it for me for 3 yrs now back to the drawing board! What to do what to do ???????? Being an unknown disease we wo n't know as individuals til we try:/ I enjoy reading posts from jhawk n msnik two different long timers with different experiences and knowledge, thanks for sharing and caring Sorry so long######Tammy, Thanks for the birthday wishes. Im nearing my 10 years and to be honest, it is scary... but im also still extremely active (just got back from the gym), still working 50 hours a week and still doing everything I did before I knew I had MS.... you can be that person too. Its a matter of not giving up! I wish you well with Copaxone. Its not as strong a drug as Rebif; however they dont know how it works, and for some people it really does keep them MRI activity free- you might be one of those people and I honestly do hope you find out you are. You wont know till you try and as you can see from my post, anything and everything are worth trying! Tysabri will eventually be replaced with BG12. I see that coming... its the same manufacturer- and the drug is much safer- its still a matter of when it will be released. I was told by the Biogen rep, Early April. We shall see. He has been keeping me posted on the reasons why it was postponed and when the scheduled release dates are. In the meantime, people love Tysabri... and it is safe to do up to 10 infusions... which was my doctors thoughts... do it until BG12 is availiable. Unfortunately, I didnt make it past shot 3.... Im afraid ill have a reaction to BG12 too, but it wont stop me from trying it. Proactive. Thats the key to having MS. You cant sit around and wait for things to happen or worry about ``what if ''. You absolutely have to live life as if you dont have the disease and simply be aware of your body and act accordingly when you need to. I dont think doing oral prendisone is a good idea for anyone... ever... but I do think in the case of ON, IVSM is necessary. We have to put our eye sight at the top of the list of things to prioritize. As long as you dont abuse steroids, they will work in your favor. Sending you hugs... strength... and holiday wishes for good health. And please know you are never alone! Nikki.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

But could have had it as soon as 1996. Been on Avonex and now Copaxone. Avonex made me a pain in the a$$ the day after so I switched to the daily pin cushion of Copaxone. I hate both. I am so sick of getting stuck and not seeing any results. Was on Avonex when I got slammed with optic neuritis. F-ed up my eyesight in right eye pretty bad. Switched to Copaxone after that. 4 months later another round of optic neuritis. (I feel so blessed to be half blind in one eye now. So, can someone please explain why neither one of the meds did anything? Why do we even bother taking these meds when there is no real way of knowing it is working? I have been out of work and money is tight. I can think of better way to spend my money than on crappy meds that do n't work.######Hey Chappy, I understand how you feel, I hope things turn out good for you and quick! I recently started copaxone and every time i inquire about what it will do for me, i 'm just told it slows the progression. I 'm sure you know that, but try not to get so upset about it, there are people who understand, like me. I hope everything works out for you. This is a horrible disease i 'm 19 and I worry everyday about what the future will bring. take care buddy.######MS club is not really what we wanted to join, huh? Avonex has terrible side effects and Copaxone on the other hand, side effects are not bad, other than like myself... itching and redness at the injection site along with lumps. Why are these drugs not working you ask? They, being the experts, say it takes at least a year of constant medication to actually begin to slow the progression down. Like with Copaxone and the need to take it every day is because it is not in your system for a great amount of time. Unsure about Avonex, Beta, Rebif or other approved drugs. I do know that Copaxone is not toxic to your liver. And it also depends on the form of MS you have. Is it RRMS, PPMS, SPMS or Benign? It could be that you were given a dx of RRMS and maybe it has now gone in to SPMS and if that would be the case then one drug that worked for RRMS may not slow it down for SPMS. I injected each and every day with Copaxone for three (3) years and one day I decided, my own personal choice and not one that my nerologist liked what so ever, was no more needles and I have n't looked back. I also changed my diet, lowered stress, exerise as much as possible, which is not always consistent. Oh, and keeping a postive attitude always works. As you both may know, MS does not treat us all the same, some better than others and some worse as others. Some may have more bad days and others good. Some may not be able to handle heat while others can. One day you can walk, the next day your leg is heavy and the following week you are able to run. When I was younger I always loved the unpredictabilities in life, however this is not what I had intended. Advice I can give is to do what you feel is best for you, keep a positive attitude and stay away from processed foods and cows dairy. And keep informed on all the latest information on MS. There are free magazines for the taking... I do n't have their sites but you may be able to find them by googling their names: Focus & MSA Motivator. Up to date info on treatment, devices, etc. ~ Zig######I was dx 'd im JAn 2004. I was on Avonex, then bc I couldnt handle the flu like side effetcs after a year switched to Betaseron, smaller more frequant doses. My husband was out of work for almost 2 yrs (ecinomy in Southern Cali is BAAAD) And we lost our health ins so I stopped taking nay meds. Then I had a case of optic neuritis and STILL do not have vision in my right eye. Its been 4 months: (Im so afraid its not going to come back. AND afraid Im going to have optic neuritis in my left eye also. I am still working and my husband is back at work so we have ins again BUT my neuro wont change me back to Beta-- (he put me on the free Copaxone program) Im so afraid to NOT be on an interferon I did 2 rounds of IV steroids when I first lost my vision and it didnt help. Im so afraid and afraid Im doing these stupid injections everyday for NO reason bc they arent going to work (not strong enough for me) ANYONE have a positive outcome of a similar situation ??######Hi everyone... I was diagnosed with MS about a month ago now, have n't been feeling `normal ' for about three months now. Optic neuritis bad in my left eye, slight spots (occasional) in my right eye... SCARY. two rounds of the prednisone IV infusions, about 3 weeks apart, three days each time. do not believe they did anything at all for me-- but impossible to know... did my body start repairing itself or did those toxic steroids actually aid in the reduction of my inflammation ?? in 9 days I am supposed to stop breastfeeding my 4 month old daughter to begin life on Copaxone and I 'm just not sure. as it gets down to the wire here I feel more and more strongly about just radically changing my diet to super healthy ie no fake colors flavors AT ALL, low fat high protein, etc.. . and my lifestyle to include REGULAR exercise (SO hard to stick to!) and lower my stress. I do NOT want a shot every day, I do NOT want to be dependent on a drug for the rest of my life-- I want to believe that I can slow the progression on my own !! I am reading `Spontaneous Healing ' by D. Andrew Weil... A MUST READ. good luck everyone... it 's a tough and nasty customer, this MS.. . but we really can manage it and I 'm going to try it without drugs. Peace.######I am also struggling with the idea of ending my MS treatments. I have taken Avonex and rebif and know i am on Copaxone. Treatments seem as bad as the disease, I am also on vegan diet as i have read in some sources similar things concerning fats and MS.######I went the Copaxone route... not my cup of tea... I use the anti-inflammatory diet and thus far it works... except I 'm having cognitive issue which is one of the downfalls of this lovely disease... Of course it does not effect each one the same way... so if it works best for us, then so be it and if not... these meds are not a cure but a hope to slow down the progression of this MonSter. Zig######To my fellow pin cushions my nuero doc has just informed me that there will be oral medications for RRMS within the next year or so and they should be very effective!Talk to your nuero and ask him about them if he 's not aware of them tell him to get on the ball and do the research so you have a better chance of getting off the needle.######Hi, every one who have been fighting MS. I know it is tough to fight. But guess the fighter in you gets tougher. Because you got live with it for the rest of your life. I am doing a study of copaxone users and avonex and trying to find which one of this two drugs have been really helpful. Please share your experience for me to learn######Hi, chrisnlaurenzmom Just want you to know that I have had Optic Neuritis in both my eyes since 2005. It came in my left first. Just about lost all vision in that eye. Had it in my right in 2008. Much less severe. Am still able to drive and work three days per week plus some at home. The long term effects of it are an complete pain in the rear. I completely understand your fear! It is very scary not being able to see very well. I am currently going through a slight exacerbation right now after being very sick with the flu. Sometimes that happens and I hate it. However, I have been taking Copaxone now since May 6th of 2008. I have to say, if what I am experiencing in Optic Neuritis right now, it is nowhere near the severity of the first two times I have had it. It '' s still frightening to me but I am not completely in the dark as I was before. So, I feel like the Copaxone is doing something for me. I hope you try it because it just might work for you and the side effects are minimal compared to the others. Marlene######I was on Avonex for 4 years. It was the worst 4 years of my life. 208 Inter-muscular self injections was enough for me. I switched to Tysabri 2 years ago. It is the best thing I have ever done for my health. It is a once a month infusion, simple and pain free. There are no side effect to speak of. I have n't had a single attack, or symptom increase in it severity. My mood and personality has been improved as well. I no longer dwell on the fact that I have to take this horrible medication, I look forward to it now.######My wife was diagnosed with `clinically definite MS ' 4 months ago with 65 lesions between her brain and spinal cord. This has been a very long battle to even be diagnosed with MS. Over the past 7 years, previous symptoms had all show up, and mysteriously gone away within 4 to 6 months. None of her doctors suspected MS from any of her problems including blindness, speech problems, numbness, balance and walking issues, over the years, but finally after numbness for 8 months and severly reduced ability to walk, they finally sent her for an MRI, and made the diagnosis. She has been taking copaxone for 3 months now with no perceivable benefit. The `side effect ' of panic, tightening in chest we were warned about, has happened 5 times already in the 3 months. Very scary. Considering other options, but will probably give copaxone the suggested 9 to 12 months. Her current numbness and severely reduced ability to walk have not reduced in severity for the past year. From what I 've read, I suspect she no longer has relapsing remitting, and now has one of the progressive types of MS that copaxone is not intended for. Best of luck to all of you, this is an awful disease that no one should have to endure.######Found out I have Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) back in May, 2011. Went to the hospital and was diagnosised with ``a-typical stroke ''... even released from the q-u-a-c-k house as this (ordered to take 81mg aspirin daily... morons!) . Luckily, a neurologist brought in on the bizarre case (perfect cholesterol, no plaque build-up, etc ~ poster child for someone who should never have a stroke!) ran 2 MRI's (one on head, other on spine) and did a spinal tap which confirmed MS days after my release. I 'm a secretor, got rid of the mercury in my mouth years ago (all gold now), been taking food-based organic herb gluten-yeast free multi-vitamin & mineral suppliments with antioxidant blends, and had been on the BloodTypeDiet for about a year (got rid of some pounds and returned back to my normal high school days weight, felt good, etc.) when this `event ' happened. Just glad it was n't a stroke! Apparently, the nerve damage from my radical lung surgery in 2007 that I rationalized was due to all the lung resections and stripping my pleural lining was actually my first MS `flair-up ' (numbness on left side down arm to wrist still, including inability to use left hand (yes, I 'm left-handed) for few weeks after surgery, inability to sweat on the upper left quadrant of my body still, and general unexplained fatigue (thought it was just old age...) was really symptoms of my first MS `flair-up '. The one this year has taken out my left hand again for months now, and includes numbness on the left side of my tongue/lips/chin so slurring is a bit of a problem (not to mention biting my toungue a lot). I can now at least hold a pen and print (cursive, including my signature, is out) about a sentence with great difficulty only early in the morning after a lot of sleep, typing one handed is a pain, and the slurring has gotten better but is worse if I try to talk fast. I 'm on Avonex- weekly intermuscular injection I give myself- an Interferon beta drug, that is supposed to help keep the attacks mild and seldom. Luckily I qualified for a 2-year free supply of the expensive stuff from Biogen Idec since I 'm unemployed and have little resources. Supposed to be the latest and greatest for RRMS out there... However, there 's also the Vanderbilt Protocol (long-term antibiotic w/vitamin boosting approach to fight MS caused by the Chlamydia Pneumoniae bacterium, killing the bacteria in all three of its phases... while trying to also protect one's liver!) and since my MS may have been initially `triggered ' by my lung issues/surgery (could n't write after discharge from hospital, numbness on left side, no sweating in upper left quadrant of my body, etc.), this may indeed even be the cause of my MS. However, as I currently have no insurance and no income, my options for now are severely restricted to this program from Biogen Idec, makers of Avonex (yeah, me sticking myself with a needle... never thought I could do it!) . I have however started working cooking parttime at the local Waffle House which does now offer insurance- down side is the first year it only covers medical expenses up to$ 2000 annually (not gon na help me much), then you are eligible for their `comprehensive ' plan which is more like a normal group health care- perhaps by then I can actually look into doing the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) diagnostic test to test for Chlamydia Pneumoniae (Cpn), see if indeed the bacteria exists in my system, and work on finding a neurologist/physician who will do the Combination Antibiotic Protocol's (CAP) for treating Chlamydia Pneumoniae... Apparently, if I do test positive for the bacteria, the 1-3 year CAP treatment is very dangerous requiring intense monitoring, supplements, and expenses, and may not be covered by all insurance policies since it 's a bit experimental. Fortunately I have the first phase of MS, Relapsing-Remitting and at such a late stage in life, so there 's a lot of hope for the disease never getting me to the point of it 's more progressive and aggressive form before I 'm old as hell anyway... I 'm also considering filing for Social Security Disability Insurance as I would qualify as my writing and speech has not come back 100% keeping me from working in my normal field (registered professional engineer: code consultant- Fire Marshal- systems designer), plus I could still work parttime as long as I did not make more than$ 1000 a month PS- The info on the Vanderbilt Protocol is perhaps the most advanced on the actual cause and cure of MS (main reason for this post)- so new it is not accepted by most AMA brainwashed neurologists, but for those MS victims with the willingness to undergo radical treatment that costs lots and is very dangerous... see: http://perfecthealthdiet.com/?p=1002######My wife presents as a 5-ft, 105lb dynamo Type ``A '' coming at you with 125% energy, Cal Berkeley Grad, half Italian/half Mexican, worked out hard at least 3x/week for past 24 yrs, now 49 yrs old. The SF Bay Area provides some of the best Medical Research Facilities in the world, including UCSF Med, Stanford, and UC Berkeley. The world-renowned and medically-published head n neuro-Opthamologist at UCSF totally missed the MS diagnosis after 4 months of testing. AS her vision worsened with time, she was finally given MRI ``s and spinal tap to confirm MS, and has been on Copaxone ever since. Her MRI's went from 7 lesions to zero while on Copaxone. Her vision has never improved, however, and proceeded to her other eye. She can no longer drive. We are looking for any Clinical Treatments for ON (Optical Neuritis) which allows the pt. to remain on daily subcutaneous injected Copaxone. Any referrals will be welcomed. Thank you and good luck to all.######Your wife should see a naturpatic doctor that specializes in MS to help restore her vision.

I do n't think I did anything to injure it. Could this be arthritis? People usually say arthritis is felt in the joints like in the fingers, and I do n't know if this would count as a joint. I 'm 23, and before you say that 's too young I wan na mention I know a girl who got rheumatoid arthritis at age 18. What should I do?######Justaguy1988, ``Arthritis '' is a wastebasket term for pain that a physician does n't know the etiology. By definition, arthritis is inflammation (- itis) within a joint (arthro-). There are hundreds of inflammatory arthropathies, many of which can affect children. The arthritis that most people think about, that comes on with age is osteoarthritis. OA is a misnomer, because it is not an inflammatory disorder. It is a degenerative one, so it is also called degenerative joint disease (DJD). However, some elderly patients do not have any OA and some fairly young patient do develop it after injury to a joint (usually referred to an traumatic arthritis). However, the joints on the back of the hand are the type that do not have much motion within them, and as such, are usually not affected by arthritis. But, there are several tendons that run in that region, which are commonly affected with tendonitis. The wrist joints are very close to that region also, and it could be that the distal carpal row is what is bothering you. If the discomfort continues despite home remedies, then you should see a hand surgeon for an evaluation. Going to your primary care doctor is usally a waste of time/money, because they will tell you it is arthritis and tell you to do what you have already tired.

What can I expect... does this mean a lifetime of suffering, or is there hope. Any and all help would be appreciated!######Degenerative joint disease is a fancy way of saying you have arthritis. Now you need to find out what kind of arthritis. You need to be evaluated by a rheumatologist. Osteoarthritis at an early age is usually treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy and other non-invasive treatments. When it gets bad enough, there are lots of surgeries to relieve the pain and disability. If it 's an inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid, there are a lot of new medications that are working miracles for most patients. That 's why you need to find out which kind you have. Arthritis is a pain... literally, but manageable. I 'm 58 and have had OA since my teens and rheumatoid arthritis for 5 years. It has never stopped me from having a good life, getting married, having kids and working. Only when I broke my neck 3 years ago did I stop working.

He wants me to run another round of blood tests to try and narrow it down. My pain started in my feet... could n't hardly walk or put on shoes it hurt so bad, then my foot swole up to 3 times it 's size. Doc put me on plaquenil (for one year), mobic (to prevent and reduce swelling), and also levoxy for my hypothyroidism. My question is: What exactly is inflammatory arthritis? Is n't that just the general term for any arthritis? I believe I have Rheumatoid Arthritis except my RF is negative so I am not positive of what type I really do have. Anyone help me out with this one ?? Thanks, South######South, whenever I go hypo, this arthritis in my shoulder starts killing me. They never told me what type it was, but I do know it swells up. For some reason I started having it while on Lipitor and very hypo. Once my thyroid levels are where they should be it does n't hurt so bad. I am usually on the thyroid boards.######I did a search on inflammatory arthritis. Here 's the jist of what I found. Basically inflammatory arthritis refers to joint conditions that involve the immune system and inflammation. In involves pain and stiffness in the morning or after sitting for a while. This is different from degenerative arthritis because in this type of arthritis the pain is usually worst at the end of the day and after activity. Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrom, and ankylosing spondylitis are usually grouped together as inflammatory disorders. I 'm sure there are more but I did n't want to look through hundreds of webpages. That 's just some basic information that I got from looking at a few websites. So your belief may be correct that you have Rheumatoid Arthritis since it is grouped under inflammatory arthritis. I think there 's a name for rheumatoid arthritis when you have a negative RF factor, but i forget what it 's called. Also, the test could be negative if you are in remission or are in the beginnings of developing Rheumatoid arthritis. I hope this helps answer some of your questions. I would search ``inflammatory arthritis '' if I were you to find out as much as you can about it so you may be able to help your doctor in an accurate diagnosis. Good luck to you!######Hey guys, I just went to the doctor today due to chronic joint pain and I also have hypothryroidism and hashimotos. He said it was inflamation in my joint near my left side. He is also testing me for ra and lupus. I really believe it is all connected and I feel like I am going down hill more everyday. I just am recovering from having a tt of my thryoid due to a small amount of cancer. I had the radation treatment and am trying to get stablelized on my meds. Can being hypo cause you to have inflammation or is it just joint pain? Sometimes I feel like it is more than I can handle. He gave me a shot in my joint and 4 prescriptions. I am already taking 10 other kinds of meds. I think its about time I go for disability. I have already been out of work for a total of 7 mths this year due to illness. Sorry I am venting. . but I need to let it out today...######Froggy- yes I believe what I have is RA. All symptoms and signs point in that direction, so it probably is too early for my RF to be seen in blood tests and things. All of this started about 2 months ago, so it is all very new to me. But with the stiffness and pain that I have had in the last few months it 's definately something serious and I want to catch it before it consumes me. Since my doc has put me on plaquenil, levoxyl and mobic... my pain has reduced dramatically. I had an ANA test done and that ran positive but my RF was negative, so I am hoping that I can get this resolved soon. I just want to know! CarolinNC- Yes, I do believe that being hypo has something to do with the inflammation and arthritis kicking in at times. I think it really just depends on how long you have been hypo and how long it has gone untreated for it to trigger the arthritis pain. Mine seemed to be anyway. Thanks, South######Have your Doc. do an anti-ccp. It is more specific for Ra and will be positive before the Ra factor will.######Wavy- yes my rheumy has ordered another round of blood tests for me and that one (Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) is on there for them to run on me. So, maybe this time around I can get more clearer results. Thanks so much for your advice. This board and everyone's info and experiences have helped me to be much more knowledgeable on what is going on with me. I really appreciate it. Thanks, South######I posted a while back and said I had and I was told there was no such thing. We at least have two doctors and two people who have it. It has something to do with the immune system. I am still learning.######TICKED-OFF, There is definately such a thing as inflammatory arthritis. My assumption is that since inflammatory arthritis is an overall name for different types of arthritis that are n't considered degenerative arthritis because they cause inflammation and the pain is different. I think if someone mentioned _____ arthritis (under inflammatory arthritis) then docs may be like oh OK! Inflammatory arthritis is definately out there. I 've recently been diagnosed with enthesitis (which is inflammation at the area where tendons and ligaments in your joints enter the bone). When I told my chiropracter he asked if the doctor mentioned Juvenile Ankylosing Spondylitis or Ankylosing Spondylitis (I 'm at that age where he 's not sure which it would be I 'm almost 18). He asked about it because according to him, there 's definately something going on in my lower back area/hips and that is where most of the problems are with AS. So when I go back to the rheumatologist I have to ask him about it since I have many of the symptoms of it, and get an X-ray in the meantime. So here's another person that MAY have a type of inflammatory arthritis.######How about ``Auto Inflamatory Arthirtis '' or ``Vaccine induced Arthritis '' anyone ever hear of them?######south, have your doctor run an anti-ccp (for RA) It is more specific for Ra that the Ra factor..######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Arthritis

Please help!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes######For the past few months my hubby has not been himself. He is tired all the time, and since mid December has been constantly thirsty. He ca n't get enough to drink. Several trips throughout the day to the bathroom, (but would n't that be from all the liquids he drinks?) His vision goes blurry, he gets very shakey, and sometimes he says he feels like he is going to pass out. No energy. While shopping last night I picked up a blood glucose test meter. We waited until this morning to do the test. He did n't have anything to eat or drink for 9 hours so we could get the proper results. The meter came up with ``510 ''. The test said if it is below 20 or higher then 600 a warning would appear letting him know it was too low or too high. We do n't know what a normal level should be. The test does n't really tell us. We did the test again about an hour after he ate lunch and it was ``471 ''. I did the test also to see what would happen and mine said ``80 '' in the morning and ``105 '' after lunch. He is 54 years old and NEVER been to a family Dr. because of not having any health insurance.Today I called all over to find a Dr. that will accept new patients without insurance. After 3 hrs. I found one who made an appt. but not until March 25. I even explained how worried I am about him. No one seemed to care. If he would of had insurance, they would have glady seen him. Can someone please tell us what a normal reading should be and your opinions on his symptoms? Thank you!######I do n't mean to scare you. But I would STRONGLY suggest you take your husband to a hospital emmergency room IMMEDIATELY. A lot of his other blood chemistries could also be out of whack and life threatening. It is possible that he may just get sent home with a prescription for glyburide, but please, you are better safe than sorry. These numbers are life threatening from what I understand. Please do not wait for the dr's appt. Go to the hospital. His numbers are extremely high. Anything above 126 is abnormal and these are life threatening values, again, from what I understand.######Normal is more in the range you saw on yourself, a bit higher would also be normal. In terms of symptoms, frequent urination is a symptom. I am not a Dr but my understanding is that where your blood sugar is too high, your kidneys try to dump some of the sugar out through urine. So you pee a lot. This dehydrates you and you are thirsty. I do n't know if you measured properly but if so, 510 and 471 would be very high. Can you continue looking for another doctor sooner? Is there not another medical service you can get help with?######I agree with Uma... your husband should go to the nearest emergency room. With blood sugars running that high, he could be in diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. While there, ask if he would qualify for uncompensated care (most hospitals have a fund to help take care of people who do n't have health insurance and are in financial straits but still need urgent medical care.) A non-diabetic's blood sugars would never go that high, even after eating a high-carb meal. Normal range is between 70 and 140, never higher. Your husband is definitely diabetic... question is, whether it 's type 1 or type 2, and the only way to tell is through some blood tests. Ruth######Yes, that would indicate diabetes, probably type 2, given his age, meaning he has resistance to his own insulin. He needs to see a doctor or go to the hospital asap to get his blood glucose in control. Normal blood glucose is between 70 and 120, so 520 is very high. Meters read ``HI '' when over 600, but that warning is just indicating extremely severe highs. Good luck, and do not let this slide so as to prevent any complications.######Finally talked hubby into going to the ER instead of waiting for Dr. appt. He does have type 2 diabetes. He did n't have any ketones which they said was a good thing. His glucose level while we were there was 296. They gave him a prescription for Metaformin. They set him up with a follow-up Dr. for this Thursday. I just want to thank e `one for telling me he should go to the ER. I was really scared for him. He 's been on the med. for 2 days but his numbers are still in the 200's. Anyone have any idea how long this med. takes to start working? Thank you all again!######Everyone is different but met can take weeks to kick in full effect. If I remember well they said as much as 4 to 6 weeks. When I started it was n't doing anything and I read it COULD take several weeks. It will slowly start to make a difference. Was it his morning levels that were so bad or after eating? In the mean time, go easy on the carbs and drink lots of water.######Not really sure if he is overweight, but probably is. . He is 6 ' 1 '' and weighs 255 pounds He 's gained 25 pounds since Sept' 07. Thats when he quit smoking (cold turkey) and took up eating candy. . tons of it! Around Nov./ Dec. is when he started feeling really bad. . (But since not feeling well he 's been losing weight) The ER did n't give us a diet plan or anything to follow before his Dr. appt. on Thursday, so I had to go online and look it up. I know the med. is making him even more sicker to his stomach, cramps, and diarrhea. I guess thats a normal side effect from what I have read about it and just to stick with it because you will feel worse before you get better ??? His reading this morning before breakfast was 189, the lowest it 's been since we started monitoring it a few days ago. Exercise. . yes, my hubby wants the both of us to start going for walks. We will ask the Dr. about it first. He 's a bricklayer and ca n't wait for spring to settle in so he can return to work. But mostly, all he keeps saying is. . ``I hope I get better ''. He 's very worried about not having insurance and not being able to work if he does n't get feeling better. Hopefully things will work out somehow.######If he is in fact Type2, the metformin will start having an effect after about 3 weeks. But if he is Type1, metformin wo n't do him any good and he will steadily get worse. The fact that the onset has been so quick, blood sugars of 500 + have been recorded, and he has lost weight suggest that it could be Type1. So watch it carefully.######He was diagnosed with type 2.######Sheila, From what I have heard and read, the side effects from metformin do go away after a while, but if they become intolerable, the best way to manage is to start from the beginning, with a very small dose, and then increase it gradually over a period of several weeks. Do n't know how much he 's taking, so ca n't tell if he 's on a large dose already or not. This is something you can work out with his doctor. Ruth######Thank you Ruth. He is on 500mg, 3 times a day.######There are people who 's pancreas produces no insulin. They are type 1. There are people who produce insulin but their body does n't use it well. They are type 2. And there are people in between who do n't produce quite enough or who 's body barely make due with what they produce. There are people borderline between the two. The progression of one to another sometimes occurs with age Doctors will try and use metformin and if your husband does n't get good control, they will try other medications and may eventually prescribe the use of insulin. Metformin is usually the first attempt. If it does n't work, there are several other weapons in the arsenal. I guess theoretically the minute you use insulin you are type 1. NIDDM is ``non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus '' (type2). IDDM is ``insulin depenant diabetes mellitus '' (type 1). I does n't really matter if he is type 1 or 2. The important thing is for him to get control, and if to do so, means insulin injections, so be it. They are not the end of the world, just think of them as a different form of medication. But for now, listen to the Dr. Metformin does a couple of things. I allows the insulin your husband has (assuming he is producing some) more efficiently. It also reduces the amount of sugar his liver produces. If he is responding to metformin, the chances are he does have some insulin production left. If it 's enough is to be determined. But remember, if not, insulin injections are not the end of the world. I hope this info helps. If it 's just annoying, let me know######I feel the need to correct a misconception here. Type1 Diabetes and Type2 Diabetes are clinically diseases and need to be treated in different ways. Type1 is an autoimmune disorder, whereas Type2 is the result of insulin resistance. While you ca n't progress from the one to the other, it is possible to have both Type1 and Type2 at the same time. The problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between them in the early stages, and Type 1 is often mis-diagnosed as Type 2. If the diagnosis was not based on insulin level and antibody test results, it could be wrong. As I mentioned in the previous post, normal weight, weight loss and very high blood glucose readings suggest that this could be the case. The fact there were no ketones could just mean that the pancreas is still producing enough insulin to stop this from happening. But things change fast in the onset of T1. And treating Type1 with type2 oral medications accelerates onset of the disease. Most importantly, these medications wo n't stop the development of ketoacidosis, which is dangerous condition. This is why it needs to be watched carefully at this stage.######Could n't have said it better myself, Mark! Also, even if T2 progresses to the point where one is insulin-dependent (as I am), it is STILL T2, not T1. It 's just T2 with a completely worn-out pancreas. Ruth######Unfortunately not all doctors and litterature use the terms the way you do. Some refer to type 1 as insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 as non insulin dependent (NIDDM). They seem to classify the result, i.e ``do I need insulin ''. You have classified them, as some doctors and litterature by the underlying issue, ie deterioration of the beta cells in the pancreas vs deterioration of the bodies ability to use insulin, that may lean to a burn out of insulin production. In your language, is IDDM type 1 and NIDDM type 2 or are those terms meaningless?######No, Type1 is not equal to IDDM and Type2 is not equal to NIDDM. And yes, it is unfortunate that the terminology has become so confusing. I think it highlights the shortcomings of defining a disease by its symptomatic characteristics. It makes much more sense to define a disease in terms of what causes it. But up until the 1970's, the distinction between the respective causes of what we now know as Type1 and Type2 diabetes were not well understood. So it was easier to call them IDDM and NIDDM. The terms Juvenile Onset Diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes were used for similar reasons. Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years. It is not uncommon for young people to become insulin resistant and for older people to have an autoimmune attack on their beta cells. It is also common for someone with insulin resistance to lose all beta cell function and become totally dependent on injected insulin (like Ruth). Also consider that an insulin dependent T2 is not the same as a T1 (who is also insulin dependent). The presence of insulin resistance means that additional treatment options may have to be considered. The net effect is that those old terms have lost their descriptive exclusivity. This is why usage of the IDDM/NIDDM and Juvenile/Maturity Onset Diabetes terminology has been superseded by ``Type1 '' and ``Type2 '' diabetes. These terms are both well understood in terms of the respective etiology, and the risk of mis-diagnosis has been brought into focus. This is what I was commenting on in the earlier post. It is easy to misdiagnose a T1 as T2 in the early stages. Doctors still use age and size as diagnostic guidelines and do n't do the required tests. Use of the old terms, IMO, is not helpful and just causes a lot of confusion. Mark######To highlight the lack of clarity, this from the definition page of the canadian diabetes association. (url) http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/dictionary.asp[/url] TYPE 1 DIABETES (or insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas no longer produces any or very little insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar as an energy source. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and affects 10% of people with diabetes. TYPE 2 DIABETES (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs or the insulin is not metabolized effectively. Type 2 usually occurs later in life and affects 90% of people with diabetes..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Points to Remember What is diabetes? a disorder of metabolism-- the way the body digests food for energy and growth What are the main types of diabetes? type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes gestational diabetes What is the impact of diabetes? affects 17 million people is a leading cause of death and disability costs$ 132 billion per year Who gets diabetes? people of any age people with a family history of diabetes most common in older people, overweight and sedentary people, African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Where Is More Information Available?

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes.

Type 1 is an auto-immune disease and it 's basically the body attacking its own cells, destroying the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. It 's type 2 diabetes that is often associated with overweight people and unhealthy lifestyles. It does sound like you could have some symptoms of type 1. Dehydration, weight loss, frequent urination, excessive thirst... these are all signs of diabetes. The itchy, dry skin concerns me a bit. If you are dehydrated then you could end up with some stomach cramps and vomiting (assuming you are diabetic). Please, do go in very soon to see your doctor but, if for any reason, you start with stomach cramping or vomiting then go to the ER or call for an ambulance. If you are type 1 and your blood sugar keeps rising then you could end up with a condition called ketoacidosis and it 's life-threatening. Until you see the doctor, stay away from carbohydrates... they 'll only make your blood sugar go up even more. If you are diabetic then you can still have sweets. Type 1 diabetics inject insulin and you just take an amount of insulin to cover the amount of carbohydrates that you 're eating. If you eat a piece of cake, you just put more insulin in your syringe. It takes time to learn how to do everything but they have good educators to help you through it. You wo n't really have to worry about any diabetic diet. And injecting insulin is n't as bad as it sounds. Type 1's usually take multiple injections each day (4) but that gives them more freedom in what they eat. The needles are very thin and very small. The older method of injecting once or twice a day is n't used as much anymore, especially with more recently diagnosed people. Good luck and let us know how you make out.######I was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) last week, and am going to my doctor tomorrow to discuss options. The reason I mention this is that I have done a lot of reading this weekend about hormones and the endocrine system, and if you were anorexic I 'm sure this has wreaked havoc on your hormones. In my case, lack of estrogen often causes lack of ovulation, menstruation, and it can also contribute to insulin resistence. I 'm tired all the time, I drink a lot/urinate a lot, I have had a recent problem with acne, and I get shaky if it 's been a few hours since I ate. If you are having diabetes-like symptoms, it 's probably because of a hormone imbalance resulting from your previous anorexia, which puts a huge strain on your body. But definitely discuss it with your doctor. And let us know what happens!######Most important thing is to go see your doctor and have him Test for diabetes. Linda is right about Type I. I have been Type I for 25 years. Taking Insulin Shots is no big deal at all. It definatley gives me more flexability with what I eat. Personally I think More Doctors should be Perscribing insulin to more type II diabetics. It like this phobia of Insulin... People Suffer altering their diet greatly and trying desprately to avoid having to take insulin.... But Why? Insulin is the BEST treatment for diabetes.... yet so many diabetic want to avoid it at all cost.######thanks for the replys! i 'm definitely going in to the doctor soon (calling to set up an appt. right now, actually), so i 'll let you all know what the outcome is. even though i realize i have a lot of the ``diabetic symptoms, '' i also realize it 's kind of vague and it could be a million other things, you know? i guess i was just feeling pretty worried and curious about what the lifestyle changes are. the insulin shot thing sounds a little freaky to me now, but i 'm sure i 'd get used to it if i had to do it. anyway, thanks and i 'll keep you posted..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Every morning I get up and take insulin, I take more before I go to bed at night. Yesterday my sugar levels kept bottoming out all day long. I was steadily having to drink juice, cokes, and other drinks with sugar, and I was having to eat constantly. After dinner, my blood sugar read 183. I was scared to take insulin before bedtime because of the events in the previous day, so I didnt. I woke up and my b.s. was 89. I still have n't taken any insulin and my sugar now reads 75. I have no idea what is going on with my body. I have n't taken insulin in over 24 hours, but my blood sugar remains normal. Could anyone help, please?######You have an interesting situation. If you had described this situation maybe 20 years ago. My response would have been that you likely had antibodies in your blood stream that were binding insulin and releasing it at unpredictable times. This was a common situation when animal-derived insulins were used. It is quite rare nowadays with recombinant human insulin to see this situation. Situations that could explain your situation besides insulin binding antibodies would include delayed emptying of food from the stomach, celiac disease, addison's disease, or perhaps a new oral medication that you did not mention in your history. Nevertheless, I am concerned that you are at risk for DKA as a type 1 diabetic without any type of insulin coverage. I strongly recommend speaking with your diabetes doctor or your doctor's CDE about your symptoms.######You 're lucky. I wish I had hypoglycemia instead of type one diabetes. the only times I do n't have to take insulin with food is after exercise. Sometimes miracles happen. Maybe your prayers have been answered..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes
565	56	5c6330a0c061d660adabefc5	http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic65793.html	0	Ok, This Is Stupid....######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy######I know this is a lot of crap to read, please bear with me... I went to the diabetes center yesterday to get a monitor and have them show me how to use it. I 'm supposed to check my blood sugar levels 4 times a day: before breakfast and 2 hours after each meal. When I went in, it was three hours after I had eaten, but we took it anyway and recorded it like it had been 2. It was 109. Now, the guidelines she gave me says I do n't want it to be above 120 at the 2-hours-after mark. So 109 is pretty significantly lower (i think), but I did n't think much about it because it had been an extra hour. I took it again two hours after dinner, and it was 92. This morning it was 70. I do n't know what the morning number is supposed to be, but that still seems low to me. My fasting number, which is pretty much the same thing, when I took the glucose test was 96, and the nurse commented on how ``great '' that was because it was so low. But 70? Maybe I do n't know anything, but those numbers seem really low to me. I do n't want to call and be freaking out or anything until I have a full day of testing under my belt, but I was wondering if anybody here knew anything about it. How low is too low? Should I be concerned?######I just took my three hour long glucose test yesterday and im worried that it will come back bad. Pretty sure it will. I dont know if I can freaking prick my fingers like that... Ahhhh makes me queasy thinking about it. The dr said it can get so worse as to inject insulin too ??? I hope you find out your answers = 0 \############I dont know a week ago I took the hour long test, they took my blood I drank the nasty sprite stuff. . Waited an hour and they took my blood the test came back bad so I had to do the same thing but for three hours and they took my blood 4 times, once before and once every hour into the test up till the fourth hour. They didnt do that with you?######Yes, they did. But what i 'm saying is that when they prick your finger, they know within seconds what your sugar levels are. They should n't be making you wait to get the results; they knew the results when you were sitting right there. It 's not like they have to send bloodwork to a lab or something. Heck, I knew before the last prick on my three-hour test that I had failed it because I was already high on two of the numbers.######Oh I havent pricked my finger yet I just took the four hour test yesterday and they said if any two of them come back high I have gestational diabities which im pretty sure they will. I used to have highinsulin a few years ago when I was overweight so thats why the dr wanted to do this test early. Also every single time I eat I get tired and when I stand everything goes black. Something tells me its all connected. I should find out in a few days how the test came out and when I do she said that I have to come in and learn about all that pricking and stuff, see a dietition and some kind of group thing.######Yes, they have pricked your finger. If you did the glucose tolerance test, that 's what they do... Besides, you said they pricked your finger. Each time they prick your finger during that test, they are checking to see if your blood sugar levels are within a certain range. If it 's too high, then that 's bad. They would have known when they did the test if your levels were too high, there is nothing to ``wait '' on. Anyway... Someone * please * answer my question ?????######They took a tube of blood each time from my arm, the never pricked my finder. Hope you get your answer######That 's weird. Anyway, good luck to you. I 'm sure everything will be ok either way.######When I had my 1hr they pricked my finger... But when I had my three hour they drew 4 tubes of blood. I still go my results the next day. Didnt' need to worry abut it. When I had fainting spells they checked my blood and told me that I needed to make sure I ate something like an apple and drink a clear soda... It always made me feel better right away. They gave me the moniter too and as long as it was above 60 I was ok. But now I don; t have the spells anymore and I do n't have to prick my finger anymore.############My grandmother is diabetic and its disgusting now I know pregnancy induced diabetes is different and does go away 95% if you take care of urself this is what I do know some of it is from hubby... Carbs are really bad (basically they are spoons of sugar but come out later) taters, anything bread, carrots pretzels, chip etc naturals sugars you eat in halves so have half an apple in the morning the other in the afternoon just as an example. Make sure ur meals are complete 1/4 of ur plate should have stuff from every food group besides that ur about average for blood sugar 109 is quite high and 70 is kinda playing it on the average-normal side. Best of luck lalee just as an fyi for anyone if you have gestational diabete and do not take care of urself/eat healthy/moderation/diet it is very possible your diabetes may carry over past the pregnancy so take care of urself now! Hubby said its really gross when people come in with diabetes, it slowly kills you and your skin dies he said the smell can be somewhat bad now majority of people who have it did do it to theselves for not taking care of themseles unfortunatly there is people who never asked for it!############I had to sign up in order to respond to this post. I am a certified diabetes educator. The information that diamondsz provided is not only dangerous, but can be construed as prejudice advice to all with diabetes. Everything that diamondz said is wrong. 1) having diabetes is ``not disgusting. '' people who think it is do not even know what diabetes means. 2) gestational diabetes usually goes away, but a person with gestational diabetes is at risk for developing it again in future pregnancies, or type 1 diabetes (we 'll get to that). 3) carbs are not bad at all. Everything you eat consists of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You can not avoid carbohydrates, and in fact, probably consume 60% of them. There are many, many kinds of carbohydrates. I would get into that, but it would take weeks of writing to tell you about it. 4) spoon fulls of sugar is bad, like she said, but it is bad for everyone. Being diabetic does n't mean it 's bad. If you ever, ever say, ``oh my god, that person is diabetic, they ca n't be eating that (insert desert item here)! '' , you need to stick your foot in your mouth. Especially if you ca n't even tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All of the ``meal plan '' advice that has been provided by diamondz are just platitudes. It is impossible to do an armchair diagnosis of a person. Use this boards as support, not as medical advice. The fyi by diamondz is even more misleading. She claims that if you do n't take care of yourself now, then you 'll have diabetes later in life. This is not true. (we 'll get to that, too.) her ``hubby '' is wrong about diabetes, and it 's shameful that he be claimed to be an authority in this field. It 's all wrong, wrong, and wrong. Yes, uncontrolled diabetes leads to complications. Please note... Uncontrolled. This means different things to different types of diabetes. I wish diamondz did n't spread the common ``media belief '' of diabetes on this board. The following information is true: there are two major classifications of diabetes; type 1, and type 2. Of all the cases of diabetes in the world, between 5-10% of people in the world have type 1 diabetes; the remainder have type 2 diabetes. Of all the people who have type 2 in the world, there are over 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes. Four of the 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes are caused by lack of exercise, poor diet, and insulin resistance. This can sometimes be blamed on the person for not exercising or eating poorly-- in fact, most of the time, it is based on food. But some forms of type 2 diabetes are not the fault of the person. Hence, diamondz calling it ``gross '' is totally abusive in her ``authority. '' some people who have type 2 have gotten it because of cancer drugs (chemotherapy). So the next time you call a type 2 diabetic ``gross '', you 'd better have your facts straight-- they could be a five-time cancer survivor, and you 've just hurt their feelings for living. Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by diet, exercise, and sometimes oral medications called insulin sensitizers or incretin mimetics. Now, to the important type of diabetes-- type 1. Type 1 diabetes does not occur based on anyone's choice. It hits randomly. I said randomly. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction. Do you know anyone with ms? Lupus? Celiac disease? These are all autoimmune conditions. Type 1 diabetes can hit anyone-- at any time. It 's commonly called ``juvenile diabetes '' because it frequently occurs in younger people, but it can happen at any age. For every one-hundred diabetics that reads this message, five to ten of them have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 means their pancreas does not produce insulin, so it must be supplied through an insulin injection. So long as the person tests their blood glucose frequently, and adjusts for carbohydrate/fat/protein intake at meals, they can ``think like a pancreas '' and keep glucose values in normal ranges. This is not an easy job-- it is a full time job. This is a very complex subject, so i 've only touched the surface. There are basal insulins, bolus insulins, and a very complex world of diabetes management. If a person does not manage their blood glucose levels, they are more prone to diseases that affect small blood vessels (like retinopathy, kidney problems, neuropathy, and the list goes on). Please-- do not look at kids with type 1 and say they 're doomed. If they are in control of their diabetes, they live just as long. And with modern technology (e.G. Home blood glucose testing), complications of diabetes are reduced. Type 2 diabetes complications are of the same manner. These are the target populations that give type 1 diabetes a bad, bad name-- diamondz comments are evidence of this. I will respond to lalee's question in the following message.######Lalee, now to answer your question. Gestational diabetes is an interesting topic to me. It 's believed that in some women, insulin resistance causes the diabetic symptoms (it can be seen like type 2 diabetes), where in other cases, it models type 1 diabetes (where the mother's beta cells stop producing insulin in sufficient quantities). Home blood glucose meter kits have a +/ -20% error. This means that if you see 100mg/dl on the screen, it could be anywhere between 80 and 120 mg/dl. The purpose of the meter is tell a story of your trends. If you were showing 200 mg/dl on many occassions, this trend would be a flag about a problem. Showing 121 mg/dl does not mean you have diabetes... Even showing 140 mg/dl does not prove anything, because of the margin of error on the test kits. This fact should help to relax you a bit. Each of those tests costs$ 1.00, so it 's hard to experiment with the meter without costing a fortune. The average blood glucose level of humans, according to quest diagnostics statistics, is 85 mg/dl. This is a plasma level. This means that including post-meal, pre-meal, and fasting conditions, a person without diabetes averages, in their lifetime, 85 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose levels fall below 60 mg/dl. Some people may experience it, and simply eating a meal (or candy) can raise blood glucose back up. You might feel shakey, confused, tired, annoyed, scared, and even sweaty during hypoglycemia. This is because stress hormones turn on in the body in an attempt to raise blood glucose-- this hormone is called glucagon. When a type 1 diabetic takes too much insulin, or does too much exercise, their blood glucose can drop-- hence their need to chomp on fast acting carbohydrates (such as dextrose). Hyperglycemia is defined as the condtion when glucose is higher than 180 mg/dl. If you give even the healthiest person in the world a bunch of candy, they will rise above 120 mg/dl. The person training you probably was reading the brochure and standard training literature. And they probably do n't know that a meter has a +/ -20% error rate. (i actually see the one-touch ultra, and if you read the small print documentation, you 'll see this is the fact). Make sure your meter code is set for the test strips you 're using-- this can skew your results a bit when it does n't match the test strip vial. 70 mg/dl is normal for waking up. The values you have presented show no signs of hyperglycemia (diabetes). If you are ever worried about having low blood glucose, just eat. Typically, you will find yourself at a low glucose level in the mornings, since you have n't eaten much. If you get up and wait 30 minutes before testing, you 'll discover that your body (specifically, your liver) releases glucose to raise you in order to help you ``hunt for food. '' you have nothing to be concerned about. I 'm going to give one more lesson for any other readers out there. Why are we concerned with gestational diabetes? Well, here's why. Insulin is a hormone that turns glucose (sugar) into fat. That 's it. Yes, very simple. People who lack insulin can not turn glucose into fat, so their bodies ``starve to death ''-- people with type 1 diabetes before 1921 (the invention year of insulin) would die, despite whatever they ate. Type 2 diabetes is defined as insulin resistance-- meaing that their body has plenty of insulin, but for some reason, is not able to use it (i could speak for hours on this topic.) you have beta cells in your pancreas that release insulin in response to high glucose values. (this is why a type 1 takes insulin when they eat, or when they need to lower their hyperglycemia into normal glycemia, which is in the range of 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl). I 'm leaving out a lot of details here... But basically, here 's the problem. If your blood glucose goes really high, the baby will produce insulin in order to lower the blood glucose in its body. You see, you share what is in your body with the baby's body. If your blood glucose is high, the baby's blood glucose will be high, too. So what does the baby do? The baby's pancreas produces insulin to compensate. This insulin, though, does not travel out to the mother's body. Instead, it works to lower glucose in the baby. Read back to what I said that insulin does. It builds fat. Here's why gestational diabetes is a bad thing: 1) the baby will come out weighing 10 + pounds... Not exactly a thing you want going through you, right? 2) high blood glucose increases the chance of bacteria to set up shop, because glucose is the essential food for all life, including bacteria; 3) having high glucose in the mom can cause oxidative stress, meaning, the mom will feel yucky; 4) having high glucose in mom can result in mom's beta cells working too hard-- if they work too hard, they will become damaged, and the mom could potentially be left with type 1 diabetes, which can occur anywhere from one day after birth to... You guessted it... A risk lasting the rest of her life. Some women have 3 kids, and end up with type 1 diabetes. Sorry for all the lessons, but I really saw a lot of information that was way out of line in this thread. Diabetes should not and does not have a negative image associated with it, as diamondz was presenting. You should never define a person with diabetes as beign a ``diabetic '' in a social situation; would you call a person with cancer something like a ``that peson with cancer '' or a person confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis (ms) a ``multiple schleratic ''? I do n't think so. If you or anyone else has questions about diabetes, please feel free to contact me. Typos are the mistake of me writing this at 2 am. I hope this helps to lower your concerns. Also, I could go into the whole world of the glucose tollerance tests (gtt) that some of you have experienced, but I think this is more than enough information to digest for now. Btw, there are people who have ``hypoglycemia ''-- where they produce too much insulin, or become hypoglycemia after eating a high carbohydrate meal. (their body responds with insulin for the meal, but the insulin hangs around too long, causing cells to turn too much of that glucose into fat). Did you know that an average person has 6 grams of glucose in their blood? That 's why diabetes is so hard to manage... If you just add one extra gram of sugar in the body, it can raise glucose values by 40 mg/dl or even more (depending on weight). Okay, i 've said enough on this. I really hope diamondz takes back what she 's said about diabetes, and that she needs to have her husband, if he 's in the medical establishment, to stop telling her what he 's ``heard. '' by the way, a person's glucose can change by 300 mg/dlin as little as one hour. So do n't sweat the small changes. If you 're between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl while fasting, you 're doing great. Two hour post-meal (also called post-prandial) should be under 120 mg/dl, though some scientists believe 140 mg/dl is just as fine, so long as fasting levels return to below 100 mg/dl. These values are played with all the time, but since your home test kit is only correct within 40% of the actual value (+20% to -20%), you ca n't freak out. Now if you keep getting results that are high, or after eating, then you can be concerned a bit more. If you have more diabetes questions, I highly recommend going to the american diabetes association website (www.Diabetes.Org) and go to the message board, and post questions in the appropriate forum. You will have very well grounded and experienced people there that can assist you with your questions.######Weird, my capitalizations on certain words has been modified... For example, quest diagnostics is the name of a business, and should be with a capital ``q '' and a capital ``d '', but when I saved the message, it was placed in lower-case format. Needless to say, the above messages I posted are not how I wrote them. This forum must modify cases to their own non-english standard. -- oh, and one more thing... Labs do n't necessarily test with a glucose meter. For the person who had blood drawn into a tube at each hour, this is because they are sending the blood in for accurate tests. Their glucose meters are the same as the ones you can buy off the shelf. That means they still have that +/ -20% error. The blood they put in a tube, however, will be sent to a lab, spun on a centrafuge, and testsed. The margin of error for lab-tested blood is typically less than 2% (that means a 4 mg/dl error range), which is much, much, much, much more accurate than a home glucose meter.######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy

Thanks######If your brother has Type 1 diabetes, the only treatment is to use insulin, either with syringes (shots) or through an insulin pump. There currently is no permanent cure except a pancreas transplant, and they usually do n't do those unless the kidneys are also failing. If your brother has Type 2 diabetes, then it would be treated initially with diet, exercise and possibly oral medication. If he 's overweight and loses most of the excess weight, he then might not need any medication at all. But if he IS Type 2, it 's important that he not delay in treating it, as the blood sugar must be stabilized as soon as possible while he is attempting to lose the excess weight. I 'm assuming that it 's more likely that he 's a Type 1. A regimen of a shot of long-acting insulin taken once a day, coupled with rapid-acting insulin taken before eating and geared to the amount of carbs he will be eating, is the best way to control Type 1.

I guess my A1c test was high. Does this mean that I have diabetes? Thanks! She said my thyroid test was also high, are they connected in any way?######No, the diabetes is the liver connection. Thyroid is located elsewhere and not related. Best to get with the doctor and get information from the tests and what it all actually means. Good luck.######This is a copy and paste from journal.diabetes.org:######Hi there, Rainbowdawn, At a basic level, they are connected in that are both endocrine disorders, with diabetes being the most common. A high A1C probably means you 've encroached into the world of diabetes on some level but the key is understanding where you are at. Diabetes treatments run the gammut from making better lifestyle choices to having to supply your body with insulin. Try not to be nervous as 97% fall into the lifestyle category. Taking many things into account, your doctor is the best person to explain the best course of action to get you back on track. Elevated thyroid levels could signal something going on and, like diabetes, types & treatments run the gammut with many being extremely common. But again, your doctor is the best person to put things into perspective. I 've been hypothyroid for 20 years and diagnosed Type1 diabetic this Jan05. and I 'm 37 y/o. I 'm not sure exactly how they are connected scientifically (other than metabolically/cellularly) but my Endocrinologist is the one who determines my medication levels for both thyroid meds and insulin levels. Until I went Type1 (requiring the need of a specialist), I was always treated by my family doctor who followed practiced guidelines. Some background on thyroid & diabetes: Diabetes is correctly divided into two major subgroups: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. This division is based upon whether the blood sugar problem is caused by insulin deficiency (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2). Insulin deficiency means there is not enough insulin being made by the pancreas due to a malfunction of their insulin producing cells. Insulin resistance occurs when there is plenty of insulin made by the pancreas (it is functioning normally and making plenty of insulin) but the cells of the body are resistant to it 's action which results in the blood sugar being too high. The sole function of the thyroid is to make thyroid hormone. This hormone has an effect on nearly all tissues of the body where it increases cellular activity. The function of the thyroid therefore is to regulate the body's metabolism. So, take heart in that, while you may be having to look at some lifestyle changes, all will be well. Hope this helps some. Cheers,- Vikingirl######What a nice, encouraging and down to earth reply, Vikingirl! More of this type of posting is needed, I do believe; too much doom and gloom and trying to scare people of their minds going on around here. I hope ``all will be well '' for everyone here, I just liked your particular phrasing. Cheers to you, too.... Roxanne.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

He has some bedwetting episodes as well. Take a look at the labs below and let me know what you think. They said he is extremely borderline but gave no care routine for us at home.######hi You need to find out whether they think his blood sugars are high due to diet related intake. This will to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes if they suspect it. Also is he having any follow up tests done?######It looks like he has diabetes to me, though he may be in the honeymoon phase. His age and the positive GAD 65 indicates it 's type 1.######I know they suspected Type 1 and he went for a trial and they checked his autoantibodies (?) and found nothing, but still have no explanation for the labs. They want to follow up once a year. Can someone give me more info on the ``honeymoon phase ''. Thanks so much for all your help, any info is appreciated. I have read so much lately that I am spinning in circles!######In a person who has type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by immune cells. However, during the period immediately following diagnosis, most people go through a ``honeymoon phase '' in which their existing beta cells still function, producing some insulin so maybe that may be why the doctors do n't want to offer any medication yet.######Hey... just wanted to add my 2 cents, I went into the hospital when I was 12 with the same symptoms. My BG was 160 mg/dl (high, but not diabeties high). THey shrugged it off and sent me home... when I turned 15, I got full on type 1, was omiting non stop, drinking massive amounts of water, peeing every 5 minutes, and I looked like Skeletor from He-man... I was in the hospital with a glucose reading of 930 mg/dl... so it took about 3 years for me to fully get the disease and who KNOWS how long I 'd had slightly elevated BG's even before the age of 12. I hit a honey-moon phase shortly after admittance at 15, and it took another 3 years for that phase to completely end (I hated the honeymoon period because I NEVER know when my pancreas was ging to kick in or not along with my external insulin injections... i.e.. . lotsa lows and highs!) If I had 1 suggestion for you, at this stage, I 'd say, measure your sons BG levels using a blood glucose meter you can buy at any Rite-Aid or drugstore in the mornings and at night before bed. If his Bg's are over 130 consistently, keep monitoring them a lot. If you start seeing BG's up over 150 consistently... it 's doctor prescribed injection based insulin time (do n't worry... it 's not that scary... the needles they use are TINY). Trust me, having type 1 diabetes these days, if caught early enough is a CINCH if you 're responsible with it. The last thing you want though, is to have him running unkown high BG's in the 250-350 range for years before he finally gets sick enough to pay a visit to the ER. (like my case)... because long-term elevated BG's can cause nerve, eye, kidney and liver damage. My final suggestion is this... if he does end up becomming full-blown type 1... read ``The Diabetes Solution '' by Bernstien. It 's an amazing, revolutionary approach to the disease for type 1 (NOT type 2's) that shows how a person with type 1 can eat and live and have to take VERY minute amounts of insulin. His method allows type 1's to live with EXCLLENT post-meal blood sugars that, like normal non-diabetics... never go above 160 mg/dl (an almost impossibel feat for type 1's... and the primary reason type 1's end up with long-term complications). The fractional insulin amounts he prescribes with his diet also make living with the disease REALLY safe and foolproof... no dangerous lows, no extrmeme highs... and very little dependence on medication. If you started him on this young (after his honey moon period) he could easily live to be 105! Hope this helps. . though I know I got pretty far ahead of your situation. These are just things I wish MY parents had known 13 years ago..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Every morning I get up and take insulin, I take more before I go to bed at night. Yesterday my sugar levels kept bottoming out all day long. I was steadily having to drink juice, cokes, and other drinks with sugar, and I was having to eat constantly. After dinner, my blood sugar read 183. I was scared to take insulin before bedtime because of the events in the previous day, so I didnt. I woke up and my b.s. was 89. I still have n't taken any insulin and my sugar now reads 75. I have no idea what is going on with my body. I have n't taken insulin in over 24 hours, but my blood sugar remains normal. Could anyone help, please?######You have an interesting situation. If you had described this situation maybe 20 years ago. My response would have been that you likely had antibodies in your blood stream that were binding insulin and releasing it at unpredictable times. This was a common situation when animal-derived insulins were used. It is quite rare nowadays with recombinant human insulin to see this situation. Situations that could explain your situation besides insulin binding antibodies would include delayed emptying of food from the stomach, celiac disease, addison's disease, or perhaps a new oral medication that you did not mention in your history. Nevertheless, I am concerned that you are at risk for DKA as a type 1 diabetic without any type of insulin coverage. I strongly recommend speaking with your diabetes doctor or your doctor's CDE about your symptoms.######You 're lucky. I wish I had hypoglycemia instead of type one diabetes. the only times I do n't have to take insulin with food is after exercise. Sometimes miracles happen. Maybe your prayers have been answered..######-General Forum Topics###-General Q and A

I have mild scoliosis and oftentimes with terrible back pain. Tonight I 'm having a back pain fit, with moments that I think is indigestion going up my stomach and into the lower left breast plate of my chest. My back feels tired and worn out, and I have a numb sensation and coldness in my left chest, especially when I lay down or sit with poor posture. Any ideas or possible explanations?######I do n't know your age or gender. If the scoliosis is mild one wonders whether it is the cause of ``terrible back pain. '' I am assuming that your pain is in the lower back. If so, such pain can not be due to indigestion. However, stomach distress, or more likely distention of the colon, cause cause some left chest discomfort. Feeling ``tired and worn out '' can certainly be due to back pain. It seems to me that you need a proper diagnosis of your back pain and of your indigestion, and that you should see your physician about these problems. And do please keep in mind that I am unable to diagnose medical conditions online..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Chest Pain

I had blood testing and an ultrasound done to test for gallbladder and kidney problems. They all showed up normal. Not long after that I went from Protonix once a day to (took this for a couple years) to Nexium (one month) to Prevacid twice a day. The back pain gradually went away while I was on the Prevacid. I did n't connect the back pain I had then to possible acid problems until recently. About 3 1/2 weeks ago, my GI doc switched me to Nexium again. About 1 1/2 weeks ago, I started getting the exact same back pain back. I am wondering if it is due to the Nexium, reflux or if it is a coincidence. My reflux has NOT been under control on the Nexium and I have had other side effects, but my doctor wo n't consider switching me to something else until I have been on it for a month. I have read about people with reflux having back pain in the shoulder and mid back area. I have n't read about any pain lower. Anyone else out there had reflux or Nexium related mid back pain ????######I have back pain too, mostly in the upper back between the shoulder blades, but sometimes in the mid back, left side too. I 'm on Nexium as well. I never had back pain before all this started, but I thought it was due to the reflux, not the medication. When I first started the Nexium, I had pain in my lower ribs, in the front, but that went away. I heard that was a possible side effect of the Nexium but I did n't connect the back pain to it.

Treatment was 14 days of a pick line with anti biotics and was healthy except for the narcolepsy till last friday when the symptoms started again. The hospital immediately did a spinal tap and the diagnosis was the same.

Like any diagnosis, I am always interested in ALL the possibilities of the causes. Doctors refer to it as a differential diagnosis. You can google ``differential diagnosis, meningitis '' & go through the list of possibilities. The reason I suggest this is that I had severe meningitis 12 years ago where I was bed ridden for over a year. My doctor kept trying to just treat the symptoms & when they did n't go away he said I had fibromyalgia. I finally found a doctor who treated patients with fibro & after tests found I had lyme disease. The co-infection ehrlichia was probably the reason why the meningitis was so severe. Lyme can mimic many other disorders, so it one of the illnesses that should be on your differential list. (Although I must tell you that you will have to have the right lab tests done & most doctors are not aware that the typical tests are not that accurate. Do a little studying on why there is controversy over lyme tests & find a lyme literate doctor & a good lab.) The effects of meningitis can be devastating and sometimes long lasting like mine. I would encourage you to seek a doctor who is compassionate in treating meningitis & pain. A neurologist would be a doctor I would get an opinion from. Keep looking for answers & solutions & never give up. When one doctor ca n't help, or tells you it is all in your head, find another one. You may have to be patient and try many different meds before you find the right combo for you. Best wishes.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

Could you classify your headache as the worst you 've ever had? How lethargic were you? Bacterial Meningitis is very serious and can QUICKLY lead to death, so I 'm thinking it probably was n't that. Usually, from my understanding if it were another type of Meningitis, the headache would get so bad you 'd be at the hospital in misery. You mentioned you have been experiencing some kind of brain damage? What are you experiencing and how would you describe it? If you are really concerned, I would go see a neurologist. They can tell from tests if the tissue around the brain & spine are inflammed. You can discuss your symptoms.

From the American Medical Association Home Encyclopedia: Viral meningitis is relatively mild and more common. It is usually not serious, clearing up within a week or two, leaving no after effects. This type requires no treatment. Bacterial meningitis can be life threatening and requires prompt treatment using larges doses of I.V. antibiotics. Diagnosis is done by lumbar puncture. Most people who receive prompt treatment recover, though some may suffer permanent brain damage. Meningococcal meningitis is the most common form of the bacterial meningitis and symptoms develop rapidly to include fever, severe headache, nausea, dislike of light and stiff neck. Other symptoms include drowsiness, loss of consciousness and blotchy skin rash. I would find out which one your party goer has and then begin calling in an outward circle fashion. Call everyone first that you know personally. Ask them who they knew at the party that you might not have, and have them call those people, asking the same thing of those people and soon you should have everyone sufficiently warned. If it is something other than the viral form, I would suggest contacting the County Health Department or having the doctor who vaccinated you report it (though he/she may have already done that). Lindaru######The only information i have recived from this person is that it is very contagious they have her in isolation in the hospital. The problem is that the party i attended was a family party, her family, and few friends to whitch i didnt know. I have tried to convince the family to take precautions and advise everyone who attended. To be frank they arent really worried about anyone else but the person infected and dont realize the risk. i would be more then willing to take the step toards contacting The C.H.D. but i dont know how.######I really do not know what the legalities are in this but the doctor that gave you your vaccination has probably run into something like this. Talk to him/her, tell them what you told us on this board, and see what he/she thinks should be done or who they could refer you to talk to. Best wishes! Lindaru######They didnt give me a vacine they gave me preventative anitbiotics. There like ``just incase pills '' because i was at a clinic. The way to get tested is a spinal tap which is a needle 3 times in your spine to take out your spinal fluids and make sure there is no swelling.The only way you can get that done is at the hospital, which costs too much money because i dont have any health insurance at the moment. But they put me in an insolated room and the doctors and nurses had masks on (if thats what there called). Anyways, i am going back on Monday first thing in the morning and i will most definatly bring that up. Thank you soo much for you help it is greatly apreceated =]. . Also i would like to say if anyone else has any other advice that i can also do i would very much like to hear it.Thanks again =)######The antibiotics should protect you against developing bacterial meningitis, just make sure you get medical attention right away if you develop high fever with bad headache or neck pain anytime up to ten days after the party. The disease is contagious, but not as bad as, say, the flu, so unless this person was sharing drinks or kissing everyone on the lips or something, it 's unlikely other partygoers will catch it. In fact, most people with meningitis do n't wind up infecting anyone else. The hospital/health authorities should be a bit more proactive about tracing contacts, though..######-General###-Open to All Other Health Topics

He is still having anti biotics- he seems to be really lucid and remebers all sorts one day and then very confused the next- the confusion varies from not knowing where he is to thinking that he is in space etc etc.. . Could anyone please tell me if this has happened to anyone else and if so how long it lasted and how long it took to recover completely. Thank you######I 'm sorry to hear about your dad. I 'm glad he is still being treated, etc.. I was in a similar situation when I had it. ICU for over a week and then a few days in the nuero ward. My memory to this day still is n't the same, but I know the first month or two were VERY foggy, memory wise. At times I could n't remember what I said or did five minutes prior. It gets better, just got ta hang in there. Keep him doing things that exercise his mind, like crossword puzzles or simple math games and the like. It may seem silly, but those simple things really can work. Hang in there !!######My sister was diagnosed 10 days ago, the doctors called her a miracle. She was released from the hospital 2 days ago with an infusion drip of penicillin. She is doing well, however, her mental behavior is somewhat childlike, she is very stubborn and very impatient, not the person she once was. We are praying this is only temporary.

Monday morning at 4:30 AM i suddenly woke up and began feeling faint. I vomited and went back to sleep. I was a little nauseous during the day but began feeling better. later that night i began having a stiff neck. this morning i woke up and i still have the stiff neck, but have no other symptoms except for a moment of faintness (possibly due to lack of eating?) . i can touch my chin to my chest with only slight pain (not severe) and the pain is mostly when i move my neck side to side. is this meningitis or just a symptom of recovering form the flu? it seems like i have had meningitis symptoms possibly but they were spread out and never at the same time.######Bacterial meningitis is a very progressive disease and you would be VERY sick by now (possibly dead) if you did indeed have bacterial meningitis. But viral meningitis can be more benign and develop more slowly. But still, the headache should be horrendous. I picked it up several years ago and you feel like your head is going to explode and ca n't take noise or light or anything. You just want to wrap your head in cotton and go into a dark quiet place. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for viral meningitis... like the flu, it just has to run it 's course. If you continue to feel really bad, see a doc to make sure but otherwise, treat it like you would the flu... lots of rest and liquids. Dehydration can give you a very nasty headache and make your muscles very sore. I used ibuprofen for the headache even though it did n't help much, the doc's did n't want me to take anything stronger in case I got bacterial on top of it... I needed to be able to feel the increase in pain. For your sake I hope it is one of the colds/flu/stomach bugs that are circulating this year. They are nasty and have a variety of symptoms to them so it could be one of those. Get well soon......... Jenny.######-Infectious Diseases Board###-Colds & Flu

Abdominal Ultrasound, CT scan with and without contrast were normal. Day 2 lipase went to 1055 (ref 73-393). I was finally released since on day 3. My discharge papers said Acute Pancreatitis.

More possibilities below: Idiopathic pancreatitis under age 40 Quote: Extensive or invasive evaluation is usually not recommended in those with a single episode of pancreatitis who are younger than 40 but some reports recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) even after one attack if the cause is not clear to look for pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors at or near the ampulla, microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct, and early chronic pancreatitis. Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich, than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E.. When im with my friends. I 've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana? Well, heres to everybody whos had to go through this damn disease, life aint over yall: wink:######Hi, i just wanted to say- be careful! I first developed symptoms at 18, was diagnosed at 25 and i 'm now 32, and i 've had 25 attacks, three within the last three months. It sounds as is your attacks are really mild- you 'll know if you need to go to hospital- because the pain gets way too bad to cope with! I do n't think my ap is linked to alcohol either, but I have cut it out, just to be sure. If you have to drink, I tink you 're better off with `long ' drinks such as wine, beer, etc.. Do n't drink spirits! And, sorry to say, you 've got to stop smoking, completely. It sends all your risk levels through the roof, and you ca n't afford it. You are already at an increased risk of cancer of the pancreas- very deadly, so you have to minimise all the other risks! Above all, do n't mess with this illness. I 've had it for a long time; sometimes it leaves me alone for 18 months, other times it hits again and again, and just takes over. Every time you 're ill your pancreas gets damaged, and you need it to last you the rest of your life. When you see what ap can do to you, it gives you a new appreciation- it can get much, much worse, so play by the rules in order to keep yours as mild as possible for as long as possible. I know it 's boring- having ap when you 're young is a real pain, but treat it with respect! C######thats good advice my son was diagnosed at 16 he is now 23 and been in and out of hospital allot and once in icu whilst on holiday in turkey, he dont touch alcohol and he still gets flare ups its a very scary illness######If you want to ward off pancreatitis, you need to stop drinking completely and smoking also. I have had to deal with pancreatitis for many years now, but more so in the last nine months. I was on a feeding tube for four months, and did n't think I was going to live through the last two attacks. Believe me, you do n't want to do anything that is going to make pancreatitis a part of your life. The quality of my life is not very good at all at the moment, and I would n't wish this on anyone. I have never been a drinker, but I do n't see why you ca n't just order a ``virgin '' when out with your friends......############every time u drink ur amylase and lipase will increase if the food you cosume contains a lot of fat pain may increase.as for ur marijuna aftr consuption u feel hungery and consume more food which might cause pancreatitis.######Hello, drinking with pancreatitis is always a bad idea !! And yes it can be avoided even when out with friends. Become the regular designated driver !! The attacks of pain you have following every time you drink should tell you it is a bad idea... With each acute attack you have, you are one step closer to chronic pancreatitis. And believe me- you do not want to be chronic !! My first attack happened when I was 8 years old (now 48). I have been chronic for the last 6 years. It is life stealer !!! It do n't kill you but it will sometimes make you wish it did. It is disabling (i have not been able to work since 2001). The pain is 24/7 and no matter what you do it never goes away. Yet you also get attacks when the pain is unbearable. Additionally chronic pancreatitis leads to many other disorders- the worse of which is type 1 brittle diabetes- uncontrollable diabetes. This comes with all the side effects of diabetes. Malabsorption is another problem. You can literally starve to death, even though you are eating. It causes all kinds of vitamin and mineral inbalances with come with their own problems. Please think twice before you take another drink. Each drink puts you closer to being chronic... And there are many more problems associated with chronic pancreatitis that I am not listing here. Reeann############Hi all. I 've just had my first attack of Acute Pancreatitis. I was rushed to ER and they gave me morphine, put me on a drip, gave me loads of antibiotics and would n't let me eat. I must admit it was pretty scary- I went in to shock and very nearly died. So I 've just got out of hospital and I do n't know very much about what to do next. The doctors did n't give me any advice except to only eat light meals ?! I see that alcohol is bad- that 's ok can live without that! Can anyone give me any advice? Am I likely to get it again? Thank you... Emma######research and learn to eat, and be devoted to, a non fat diet. I did not say low fat, I said non fat. It is the most important thing and I do n't see it on these posts. Maybe people do n't know how to eat to live with this disease. Please google non fat diets. Work up some recipes you like and stick to them, and carry a tupperware container of these foods with you if you go out. NO ALCHOHOL whatsoever. Do n't even smell it. Put mustard on your sandwich, no cheese no mayo. No egg yolks, buy egg whites in a container and scramble. maybe a slice of non fat cheese on the top. No butter at all, not light butter, nothing of the sort. No birthday cake or pastries, have angel cake instead. Spend a year working on the non fat diet and you will adapt very quickly. Never go off it. this is the way you will live from now on. It takes attention but you will be able to live with it easily once you get the hang of it. Take yours with you, is my advice.############i had an episode of acute pancreatitis about 4 years back. It was intense pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the back.my glucose level was also slightly high. sinnce then i have stopped drinking completely. thereafter i never had any problems whatsoever.my glucose also is normal.but thereafter my calcium level is always low. now i am taking calcium supplements 3 times a day. the absorption is very poor. i also have to take vitamin d. can i now start drinking occasionaly.######My boyfriend has been hospitalized 4 times in the last year for pancreatitis but he continues to drink, now the doctor said this can kill him is that true? He does not seem to get it he thinks that they are just make things up can this kill him if he does not stop drinking ???######I 've had a very serious acute pancreatitis attack 3 days ago... the pain got worse throughout the day and at 1am in the morning I was n't able to take it anymore and asked my husband to bring me to the ER. I stayed in the ER for 6 hours, got an IV, they took my blood, urine samples, and did an ultrasound. It did not take them too long to figure out that I had acute pancreatitis, but they said they can not figure out why- I do n't really drink (maybe once in 4 months ??) and I do n't have gallstones- two of the most common causes for acute pancreatitis. I asked my mother if she had symptoms like that before or if it was in my family, and actually she said she had something like that before, similar pain, but back then they were not able to give her a correct diganosis (40 years ago). I am only 25, and had pain in my stomach before, however, I never took it seriously or it was never that bad that I had to go to the doctor or to the hospital. I have n't had any solid food in 3 days, I am scared to eat because of the pain. I am drinking lots of water and broth, but even decaf tea or chicken broth gives me pain, not too much, but I can tell that it takes time to get better. I got pain reliever like vicodin, which knock me out. I wonder if I can ever go back to my regular diet, I never really cared what I ate before, it was usually a very balanced diet, and sometimes it happened to be a bit fatty/oily. I will have a follow up appmt with my doctor next week and I 'll try to find out more if I have to adjust my diet from now on. Is it normal to feel pain when drinking broth/ tea after acute pancreatitis?######If drink was the cause of your acute pancreatitis, give it up, because when- and it will be when- you develop chronic pancreatitis, you 'll remember all those blase evenings of getting trashed with absolute regret, while being in total agony in the present and unable to think clearly about your fearsomely shortened future. Drink can be fun, until it is n't, and when it 's threatening your wellbeing, just give it up. Seriously. i ca n't put into words the extent to which you 'll rue the day you carry on.######hey guys.... . im 16 yrs old i have had two attacks of acute pancreatitis lol its acyually funny im sitting at mayo clinic now getting a bunch of tests done for this... i was first told i hace this two weeks before my 16 birthday and have since had to make a lot of lifestyle changes... i used to drink about 3 times a month with my buddys but havnt had a drop of alchahol since my first aattack... i also used to smoke cicgarettes (about a pack a day) but quit after my second attack... both times i was put on a low fat diet which is 50 grams of fat per day... for all who dont know that is about 5 tablespoons of mayonase !!!!! i was recently told i could continue a normal diet but have chosen not to... i guess i really dont want to take the risk of getting it again... for 1 it is way painfull... i dont know how many times i blacked out bc of it... and for two i am now repeating a semester of my sophmore yera bc i missed so much school and i just kind of gave up. . plus it really isnt worth the week in the hospital and not eating for three days.... if you ever want to know more or want to ask n e questions you can message me... ttyl guys....######i had ap to. almost died. multiple organ failure followed along with adult respitory distress syndrome. ap usually doesnt go this far but for me it did... my pancreas shot poison into my body. . making my lungs shut down... do i drink now? yes i do... just not as much... i do not expierence stomach pain when i do it though but am always watching for any sign of it, cause then id stop. Life goes on. Doctors will naturally tell you not to do it... but i dont worship that religion and a doctor is not a priest for me as it is for so many others. Listen to your inner most voice. . and it will tell you what you are allowed and what you are not. Pay attention to pain, it is there to warn you and tell you something is not right. I always had warning signs but unfortunately i did not listen to them... i thought drinking more would make the pain go away... and before you judge me... let me say this... im sick of encyclopidia people who believe everything they are told You have a disease... you must be aware of it, but you must live and be merry as well... be the designated drive... ha! some people arent that boring If i sound like a ahole... fine.... but im sick of hearing stupid advice that not based on fact the truth is they dont know where the limit it so they say dont do it at all... i say dont do it at all if you are too stupid to find your limit... but if not, find your limit and listen to your body...... and live and laugh... life is too short to go through it trying to prolong by erasing all the little pleasures... those who want the last years where u pee your bed and cant move... you go ahead and live healthy to die long.... i dont want to die long and im sick of your opra, self help answers######I am writting even though I it may be premature to do so. But I have been devasted by the news at the docs. I have had some discomfort in my right side abdomen just under the edge of my rib cage. I had an ultrasound done and the doc told me I have a cyst in my pancreas... now I am scheduled for a CT scan and I am freaking out of what it might be. The doctor has put a rush on it. . and this has made me even more nervous. I drink but mostly on weekdays, and usually have a beer daily... what is going on ??? I have had heart burn and bloating as well for some time, and many times loose stools. Guess I am looking for good news or something comforting... anyone know what is going on and should I worry ???######A Brief Journey of my pain In January 2010 I experienced my first symptoms of pain which turned out initially to be jaundice followed by a diagnosis of gallstones which meant an admission into hospital in early February 2010. After my first admission eating fatty foods was a key cause of the episodes of pain and was told by the consultant to have my gallbladder out 6 weeks ago but instead gave me 3 months to decide as I was not in a fit state of mind to decide whether I really wanted it so was expected to give him my decision on 13th July this year. I have continued to cut down on fatty foods and have lost almost 3 stones in weight since the beginning of the year, I am not grumbling about the weight loss however I would have preferred to do it differently avoiding pain attacks relating to food intake. I now eat substantially less and better variety of diet along with gentle exercise a few times a week, these pain occurrences have totally changed my life, clothes are loose and although I was t-total before now I will be for the indefinite future as I donâ$ t want food and alcohol relating to further pancreatitis so overall despite the discomfort in hospital I am much healthier and happier. Events superseded my decision to have my gallbladder out late July 2010 so in May this year was admitted again with gallstone induced pancreatitis which was extremely painful resulting a week or so later with my gallbladder removed. I was petrified of the operation but I had it done as I could not bear any more pain so I took the risk of general surgery via key hole. Waiting 8 hours in squelching UK heat was not pleasant especially when you are nil by mouth. On 29th June I was discharged from the consultant only to find a week later I was admitted with a further episode of an infection of the pancreas spending seven nights at the local hospital. Now I hope they have gone for good so when I see the consultant surgeon at the end of August I can try and be discharged for a second time. This time I had severe hiccups, excess sweating and lots of vomiting adding to jaundice, gallstone and acute pancreatitis, why do things in halves, all this when I donâ$ t drink, smoke, eat pretty healthily and have good health yet I have all of this unlucky or what.

Mark Crossley######hello all im 25 years old, i drank wine everyday for the past two years at least a bottle maybe two. i was jus released from the hospital today for pancreatitis. my levels were all off my pancreas was at 10,000 my potassium, and other electrolytes were low. i was in the hospital for 5 days the dr. told me i should not drink anymore as i could possible develop cronic pancreatitis. my question is did anyway experience a bloating around their abdomen or weight gain in that area after being released from the hospital? i was fed thru an iv and given pain pills so i cant understand what the reason would be for the weight gain. thanks in advance######Yes it is very normal to have bloating and gassy feeling when you are released from the hospital and it lasts for weeks until it is finally gone. Your stomach can look and feel huge! I am not sure about the weight gain except I know that the pain killers they give you cause you to be constipated and you need to be on stool softeners most times. I have been in the hospital 8 times with this and struggle to quit drinking but know if I do n't that I will develop chronic pancreatitis which will eventually kill me.######I just got out of the hospital today after four days in there. I was on the IV the whole time and I gained 10 pounds and my stomach is totally bloated still. I did not have any food till this morning, which was some of that hospital egg stuff. It did not hurt after eating it so my doc let me go home. The couple of doctors that I talked to said that I can go back to my regular diet (which consist of meat, dairy and junk, no fruits of vegies) as soon as I felt comfortable. They also told me to stop drinking for two weeks and then I can drink again. I do not drink every day and only have a couple of beers unless it is some sort of weekend away, then I can drink a lot.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago. I was in Tanzania when I got it and was rushed into hospital because the pain was unbearable. After 3 days there I flew back to England and remained in hospital for another 10 days. During my stay I had ultra sound scans, a CT scan, a cannular put in and over 25 blood tests. I wasnt allowed to eat or drink for 5 days. They said they thought it might be the malaria tablets I had been taking- doxycycline, but they couldnt confirm it and wrote down it was idiopathic on my discharge form. Ive been told I can try drinking again after 3 months but I 'm pretty terrified of it coming back- I cant handle that pain again! I think i will drink in the future if I can, just not binge drinking, which my doctor said should be fine.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago.

I am not as physically fit as I used to be but I still swim and play basketball weekly. My diet consist of fatty foods and I hardly drink beer but when I do it 's binge drinking, around 5-6 beers about once or twice a month. I went to ER complaining of stools without any pain at all, so they ran stool test, blood work and ct scan and everything was fine but my lipase levels were EXTREMELY elevated at 1700. They admitted me to hospital for a few days and I responded well to clear liguid diet the first day, I was retested and my lipase next morning was at 1050, still high but a significant reduction. Next morning it jumped to 1130. I was shocked and was upset that the lipase was not going down. All my lipids, liver panels and cbc were normal. GI doc said he 's certain it was acute pancreatitis. He then ordered a 2nd CT scan this time with oral and IV contrast and once again, it was clear but GI doc not did talk to me about results, he sent nurse in to send me home. They sent me home only telling me to lay off alcholol and see him in 2 weeks. Why would any responsabile doctor, especially GI send someone home with a dangerous lipase of 1130? I was shocked again. This still left me with many unanswered questons. Maybe you guys can help me out. 1. I get abdominal pain and sometimes mild diarrhea after drinking moster energy drinks, dairy and iced coffee drinks. Pain always lasted for a less than 5 mins and relieved after bowel movement, I never had pain that persisted for hours. I also associated this brief pain with IBS. No D if I stay away from those trigger foods. Does pancreatitis always create severe abominable pain lasting for more several hours? 2. How can a doctor tell if it 's acute or chronic pancreatitis? Can you have multiple acute attacks or is more than one attack considered chronic? From what I read CP eventually becomes less painful due to failing pancreas and amalyse levels are normal. Since I have no pain, I assume it 's CP and those small bouts of 5 minute pains were pancreatitis flare ups. 3. Anyone have insight of survival rate and lifespan with this condition if treated properly with low fat diet, exercise and abstinence from alcohol? I read it reduces lifepspan 10-20 years for any cp patient. 4. Does chronic marijuana use contribute to pancreatitis? I smoke tons of marijuana and I just switched to edibles after diagnosis, even though GI doc think it has nothing to do with it. Thanks.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

I 'm totally not the typical pancreatitis patient- female, thin, fit, good diet, minimal alcohol consumption, no visible gall bladder stones on ultrasound... I had the pancreatitis for 5 days before taking myself to hospital. In those 5 days I saw two different GPs. One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain. My husband died of Pancreatic Cancer 15 years ago. oh, and the depression is worse, of course. Wishing you luck Ann######Hang in there!######Oh gosh, Ann, that sounds terrible. I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment. Can that happen from acute pancreatitis or only chronic?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

I have been a lacto-ovarian vegetarian (I have an occasional egg or slice of cheese, however I prefer soy milk to dairy) for almost 3 years. I have been a complete nonsmoker for almost two years, however, prior to that I did smoke cigarettes, and I have been alcohol-free for almost two years (however, prior to that, I did have an occasional glass of wine or beer). I have been HIV + for almost 18 yrs and asymptomatic. I have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count around 276. I have also been diagnosed over the years with a peptic ulcer (although I believe that this no longer is an issue), hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease bordering on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (confirmed by a liver biopsy), lipoatrophy, osteopenia, and pancreatitis (I have sustained half a dozen attacks, one in particular where I was hospitalized for a month in Mass General). It is believed that all of these conditions have been medication-induced. My concern, however, is the frequency of my pancreatitis. I sustained an attack in November last year and most recently another in March of this year. I have had ultrasounds, and most recently an MRI CP as well as a fecal elastase done and no significant abnormality was found. Recent blood work has indicated that my triglycerides are 377 (nothing compared to what I 've had in the past, however, my last bout in March occurred when I had only 600 and something), my lipase is 456 and amylase is 101. As an aside, my glucose has been fluctuating around 125 for a while and my liver functions are AST 165 and ALT 226. Despite being told that my current medications do not aggravate the pancreas, I have my doubts (since my HIV medications have always been the culprit of my physical demise). Isentress (raltegravir) 400 mg tablet BID Emtriva (emtricitabine) 200 mg capsules QHS Sustiva (efavirenz) 600 mg tablet QHS Tricor (fenofibrate) 48 mg tablet QHS Xyzal (levocetirizine dihyrochloride) 5 mg tablet QHS Boniva (abandonee sodium) 150 mg tablet once a month Loperamide Hydrochloride tablets PRN Rozerem (ramelteon) 8 mg tablet PRN Butal-APAP-325 CAFF TAB MIK (substituted for Fioricet) PRN Zovirax (acyclovir cream) 5 mg PRN It has been suggested that perhaps these bouts of pancreatitis are simply idiopathic, or that I have some sort of autoimmune pancreatitis. I was also informed that I could have an endoscopic pancreatic function test done in order to further pursue this problem. Is there anything that I or rather we-- me and my team of medical doctors-- should be doing? Or should I simply resign myself to be like Beckett's characters in his play and wait not for Godot, but for pancreatitis?######There are many cases of acute pancreatitis, being a first manifestation of primary HIV infection. This is explained as a result of the infection itself (they were just diagnosed and without antiviral treatment). Also, some infections that are common in HIV positive patients, could lead to an attack of pancreatitis (ex. mycobacterium avium). As you said, medication-induced pancreatitis is common appearance in HIV patients. Having a history of high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides is a risk factor for pancreatitis. It is good to know that sometimes even a single attack of pancreatitis can lead to a chronic one, despite the cause of the initial attack. Eating four or five meals a day consisting of food low in fat may help reduce the frequency and intensity of the flare-ups. Blood tests for elevated pancreatic enzymes and insulin can be elevated in patients with chronic pancreatitis, but, they are n't so useful in confirming the diagnosis. An MRI scan, CT scan, or endoscopic study, for correct diagnosis and for finding certain complications, are the best diagnostic choice. These imaging techniques are also recommended because of the greater risk, chronic pancreatitic patients have for developing a pancreatic cancer.

Recently my vision has gotten blurry, sometimes it is so hard to see that it gives me bad headaches. I know nothing about diabetes. Should I be tested? Thank you for your help.######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or ther other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. Curious. Rose######Do you have pancreatitis? What other testing have you had? Anything to rule out one or the other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. If you want to rule out diabetes, your doc should help you discover what is going on with you. Hope you can resolve this. Keep us posted. Rose######One doctor immediately said chronic pancreatitis, since my levels have been so high but have rollercoastered over the past couple years. But they ca n't find a cause or a cure for it. All catscans and MRI's have shown everything to be normanl, no blockages, stones, or inflammation.######Pancreatitis and diabetes can be related. If you have chronic pancreatitis, your pancreas is apparently comprimised and not functioning at it optimum level. Have you been referred to an endochronologist? When I was in hospital and not able to have anything by mouth for 10 days, on day 6, they introduced I.V. nutrition. This I.V. bag of `food ' was mostly sugar, with electrolytes and other vital supplements. I have not previously been diagnosed a diabetic, although I was borderline gestational diabetic with my first child and not with the second. The I.V. food bag, caused my blood sugars to be all over the place. I had insulin shots every day- multiple times a day- while the food bag was on the I.V. pole. They kept increasing the insulin in the I.V. food bag, but still needed to give me the shots- my body just was too busy trying to heal the pancreas to regulate blood sugars too. I believe that my insulin levels are not right yet and it has been a month that I 've been out of the hospital now. I need to see my doc/intern and get blood sugars checked as well. Just saw the gastro doc and still have a couple issues from that hospitilization episode yet to take care. I would make sure the pancreas is able to produce the insulin you need- You need to be proactive about it. Keep us posted Rose######I am not a medical professional but I do know from experience that yes diabetes and pancreatitis can be related. I have type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with chronic pancreatitis. They dont know if I was born with the chronic pancreatitis yet but looking back on my life long medical history it looks like I may have been. This is likely to be the reason why I am a double diabetic. So far lots of places I have read about online say that both chronic and acute pancreatits can lead to diabetes.######Thank you for all of the responses everyone. I have never been able to get a doctor to send me to an endocronologist, nor could I get one to accept me, because my blood sugar is always normal. My amylase and lipase are always a mess, but I ca n't seem to find anyone who wants to do anything other than take out my gallbladder. =-LRB- I 've given up for now..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

The doctors say it was idiopathic and then we found out that it runs in my Dad's family. Then, a year later, my brother also had an acute attack. Since then, I have felt just fine. When I left the hospital, I asked the doctor if there was damage to my pancreas. He said he did not think so. No referral really, and that was that. I felt better and got on with my life. I never really drank alcohol before the attack, and have NOT had ANY since. Over the last few years I have developed a major hypochondriacal state about my pancreas, even though I have felt fine. I have been to the ER 3 times when I had a little burping, panicking that my pancreatitis was back. All three times I was examined and had blood labs run, and nothing showed up. I was sent home and it went away. Lately, anytime I have a bit of a tummyache or anything I panick some more. Would I know if I had chronic pancreatitis since my pancreatitis the first time 4 years ago? I 'm terrified that something is wrong but I do n't know it because I feel good mostly all the time- and I read online that you can have CP but not even have symptoms! Would I have lost weight by now? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I am trying to get in with a Gastoenterologist just so I can ask some questions and get some answers- they never referred me after my episode and for 4 years I have been so anxious, and reading the internet does n't help at all.

This was due to my alcohol use. I only drink socially but when I do I binge drink. Im not an alcoholic just a normal college kid. Im having a hard time accepting the fact that I may be able to ever drink again but is there anyway I possibly could if I closely monitor my alcohol use and drink in moderation and cut back a lot? I have been drinking mostly alcoholic energy drinks and vodka since ive been down here at school, mainly in part cuz its the most forgiving to my wallet. Ive heard alcoholic energy drinks are really bad for you and the FDA made a threat to take these off the market recently unless it was proven they were safe to drink. I was also taking nitrous oxide supplements whenever I 'd work out at the gym, so I think this could have also played a factor into this pancreatic attack. I also had a similar attack almost a year and a half ago, the pains were very similar. It was however diagnosed as gastritis so I dont know if they misdiagnosed it or not. Obviously my health is# 1 and I am planning on taking an indefinite time off of drinking until I fully recover from this. It sucks bc my friends 21st bday is in 2 weeks and me and a bunch of friends were planning on going to celebrate in vegas for spring break in 1 month I will most likely be a DD for him on his bday weekend and its going to be really hard resisting temptations to want to drink in Vegas but if I have to obstain from alcohol then thats what Ill have to do. The doctor said I recovered really fast bc I had been taking good care of my body otherwise (diet) etc.. So will there be any possible way I can come back or is alcohol a done deal in my life?######You make the choice: give up alcohol or risk the possibility of recurrent bouts of pancreatitis (and the possibility of a lifetime of suffering due to chronic pancreatitis).

Colleen######brandy, do n't lose hope. i suffer from uc also, but have not taken prednisone (my specialist believes it is a medication of last resort, thank goodness.) asacol is available here in canada, but under the brand name salofalk-- i use the suppositories and have never suffered any side effects. it has put my uc in remission every time i 've had a flare. if your doctor wo n't consider anything other than prednisone, i 'd really try to find another doctor. good luck! daisy######Hi Brandy, Asacol is available in Canada... my doc prescribed it and it has worked fantastic for me. Depending on where your uc is he might prescribe Pentasa instead. The only difference is where the medication gets distributed through the bowel. Please ask your doc about it and give it a try. Willow######thank you so much your replies mean alot to me, i feel so alone and i pretty much cry everyday cause i cant imagine that i have to live like this for the rest of my life... i am in so much pain... and i have a full time job which it is starting to effect. i had no idea that asacol was salofalk. . i am currently taking salofalk right now and have been for the past 2 yrs. has anyone heard of sedacrohn? and does it work? also has anyone experienced a weird tingly sensation in the forehead ??? i get it all the time after an increase of meds. /.######This is just in response to the messages posted about Asacol and Salofalk. These drugs are not one and the same. Asacol is Asacol (little red/orangish pill), and Salofalk is Salofalk (oval-shaped yellow pill). I was on Asacol several years ago, and it was not effective for me. In fact, I was literally unable to digest it, and it was appearing in my stool as whole (completely undigested). I was then put on Salofalk, which worked for some time. These drugs are similar in that they come from the same class of drugs- they are both what are called ``Delayed-Release Mesalamine drugs ''. This is perhaps why it was said that they are the same thing. As in my case, people may find that one works, while the other is n't overly effective. I suppose some doctors might believe that if one has n't worked, the other is n't likely to be effective. But, it 's worth asking. Finally, for the record, I am from Canada, so I know that both are available here. Best wishes.######i think i can help you, my father has had that for about 3 years now, hes been taking this prescripton med called Colazal, its like asprin for your colon and he helps me with pain. i also have something like colitis, it runs in my family i 'm 25, my twin brother has something too, and my dad's mom has troubles too. anyway my dad takes that medication but he find this natural stuff called Aloe MP plus, its all natural stuuf and its been working great for my dad, he loves the stuff. i have been taking some too and it helps me with my pain but i also take other stuff too. i try and stay away from prescription drugs cause they will probably hurt you in the long run. there is also aloeelite, disgestionol which are all for digestional problems. but the thing is you have to be willing to pay a good amount to get them. for digestinol its about 165 a bottle for 270 pills and aloe mp plus is 137 a bottle for 270. if i were you i would really try this out.for these you take 9 a day, 5 in the morning and 4 at night. they ca n't hurt you in anyway. believe me i i got pain pretty bad pains, going to the bathroom alot. i got it all and i 'm so sick of it that its driving me absolutely nuts that i 'm getting depressed. i go see i gi doctor in aug to see what exacly i got and i hope i do n't have what you and my father have. my doc thinks i have some kind of ibs so we will see. i hope this helps you. just makes me feel better that i 'm not the only one in this world with this problem... david######Brandy, Sorry to hear about the flare up, I know they are not fun and so embarrassing to talk about! I 'm just getting on the other side of a flare up (I think/hope) so I do understand. BTW I am a 36 yr old female. I was diagnosed with Crohn's last year and put on three drugs; asacol, entocort ec and cipro. It went into remission pretty quickly. I 'm now on week 2 of the same three drugs and the pain is much less, although I am having some side effects from the Entocort. I 'll take my side effects to the pain I was having two weeks ago! Please search entocort on the internet and read about it. I really think it 's working for me. From the web ``Entocort EC is a nonsystemic corticosteroid that is released into the intestine and works to reduce inflammation. Because 90% of the drug is released in the intestine and not into the bloodstream, it causes fewer side effects than other corticosteroids (i.e., prednisone). '' The Entocort is very expensive. I am in the states with good health insurance and I still had to pay$ 125 out of pocket (the script was over$ 400).

I would also suggest as much non gluten foods as possible. Best wishes.######There are also several good books out there with good diet advice.######Many I am now 55 and have had Crohns since a young child. The first thing you need to do is find a good gastroenterologist !! ~ One that you like and works with you. there are many meds for Crohns... You need to be on a maintenance medication. asacol is for people that have Crohns that is not severe. Sounds like you need something that is suited for you. . As to foods everyone is so different. What one Crohns person can eat and not have problems another Crohns person ca n't. Its all trial and error you need to find the foods that do n't bother you. . Me I can eat most anything when my Crohns is ok. And when its not ok anything I eat causes problems. . The first thing you need is to find a doc to work with you.Get on good med. . ASAP######Obviously you were seeing a pediatric GI dr. Well, my GI has me in remission, for 12 years. I had chronic ulcerative colitis. Get a gi that you can understand, that puts you to sleep for scopes, that calls you back anytime you call pronto, I took asacol. It gave me headaches, bad. But, @ the time (1988) that was the only medicine. What allergic response did you have? Also, if you have blood, & hosp gave you pred, you are rebound flaring from the steroid being gone. My dr would have put me in hospital from what you are describing. Can your old GI give you the name of someone good? You see, you need a dr who will say like mine did ``If you do exactly what I say I promise you will never lose your colon '' He kept his word. Im free. Please see a new GI Monday? You are playing with fire. Your parents are supportive? Tell them how sick you are. Get them to help you find new dr. Im so sorry. Wish i could help more. Drink coke, then when better eat jello & mashed potatoes. My standard for 12 years.God bless you, gmak p.s. you can ask me anything, anytime, or i will just listen. < 3######Iv had UC now and been in constant flare no one had fixed me im 20 years old i understand where your coming from, im due to speak to a councilor due to my tablet phobia and depression over the illness. Ulcerative Colitis has ruined my life but the doctors in the mater hospital are now fully aware of my true condition as ive only been honest about the tablet phobia i used to lie and say i was taken them, but i havent been! so im on a course of steroids now and if i can not take them il have to go into hospital and get the through IV. . hopefully they can sort me out, also im getting booked in for another full colonoscopy soon... FUN TIMES \* miserable x######I am also a college student and have been diagnosed with Chrons. I hate it also and its hard to make the professors understand that you really cant be in class. Aside from taking online classes there arent many options. I went and talked to my advisor and they told me to fill out the disability form and turn it in to the school. Its kind of embarrassing but the nice thing is that if you miss class because of a flare or being in the hospital because of your chrons, the professors are REQUIRED to let you make up the work. I did it and have had to use it. When you go to the teacher and they say there is nothing they can do, you pull out the disability paper and say they have to. If you dont want to go that route then talk to the dean above that professor. You have to fight for your education and make people understand what you are going through. I hope that you get this all worked out. I have been in the hospital all week with a flare so I know what you are going through.######Hi... where exactly in the colon is your crohn's colitis located? Is the rectum involved as well? It 's Crohn's colitis... one disease, which would be Crohn's in the colon. But do you have it located anywhere else? You definitely need to get referred to a GI doctor, one who can get you on treatment and help you with your discomfort, etc.. While prednisone can be helpful, it 's not a treatment that I suggest you depend on. What happened when you were given Asacol? q.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

One of the medications that they have me on is prednisone. I was wondering what the side effects are. I have heard that it might cause a puffy appearance to the face and mayeb some acne. I am really worried about having a ``puffy '' face, so if anyone here takes prednisone, has taken it in the past, or knows someone who is one it, please please please tell me what you know. . I dont want to look nasty with a puffy face. By the way I 'm 14. - Madeline######Hi Madeline! I 'm sorry to hear that you have Crohn's Disease. That 's NO fun. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (also a form of IBD). I 'm 14 too. I was put on prednisone, a total of... 6 times in the past year. Whenever I was put on a really high dosage to control my `flare-ups ', I would get some acne on my face. It was n't that bad though. I also would get mood swings. I could really be a real witch at times, but people excused it because they knew it was the medicine. I also got the `jitters' a lot, and had trouble sleeping. Right now I 'm `weaning ' off prednisone. I 'm on 20 mg and going down, yeh! I 'm having to take it in the morning since I could n't sleep at nights from the `jitters'. When I first started taking it I got really worried about the puffy face too. However, it 's really easy to manage. Just watch your salt intake. Try to cut down on the amount of salt you eat in foods, like potato chips and pretzels. When ever I would get the puffiness (which really is n't that bad), I 'd just drink a lot of water. It goes away once you drink the water. I never found prednisone to actually help with my IBD, but apparently it has, because now (I just had my 3rd colonoscopy/enodoscopy done) and it turns out I 'm doing REALLY well. So there is hope. Good luck! And really do n't be scared about taking prednisone, the side effects (at least for me) were n't bad at all and about 2 weeks after you 're done taking the steriod, the side effects go away, no puffy face, no acne. It 's all gone once you 're done. So, hang in there !!! - Carlie######Carlie- Thank you SOOOOO much! That was the most encouraging reply that I have gotten. I went to a website today about teens with crohn's and everyone was so dicouraging, but you gave me hope! The only thing that really sucks is that I hated having the colonoscopy, and endoscopy (sp?) The prep for it was HORRIFIC, not being able to eat for 3 days and drinking that stuff that makes you throw up... and the cramps. . OH THE CRAMPS! I was hoping that I would only have to have it done once. I remember them putting me out (of course not ``all th way '' for whatever reasons they had) and I remember it really hurting too. . I guess I 'll just have to suck it up if I end up having ot get it done again. . but THANK you SO much for your reply! - Madeline######Madeline, I 'm sorry to hear that you got some discouraging stuff. Sometimes people get really down when they find out the have IBD. It 's not a fun disease to have, and people can get embarrassed. Expecially at our age. Anyways, OMG, I 'm right there with you. My first scope was horrible. Not only was I craving food so bad, but then you had to drink that stuff that made you sick as a dog. I figured ``Just get the test over with and you 'll be fine '', but then after the test I was even sicker. I was throwing up blood from the biopsies, hurting like you would n't beleive, etc.. But then the second scope I had went... better. This last one was n't too great. The day that I was n't allowed to eat was Halloween. Yeap! Of all days right? SO the whole time I was craving candy, but I pulled through and got wonderful news !!! It turns out that I 'm doing really really well !!! I 'm not in a flare-up and I feel pretty good !! So just goes to show that you can have good times too. And that 's what we have to remember. Living with IBD is tough, but it IS liveable. STAY STRONG HUN! You 're doin ' great. Oh! And do n't worry about getting another scope. I had to have so many because of other reasons (lot of weight loss) but usually you just have to have a scope once every 2-5 years unless you 're having a lot of flare-ups. - Carlie######Unfortunately, Prednisolone is a steroid and although steroids reduce inflammation, they have lots of side effects, such as steroid induced acne and long-term use can create steroid induced diabetes. That is the same reason that you are experiencing a puffy face. This I am afraid is typical of steroids and is called a `Moon Face'. You can also get an increase in appetite and can gain weight easily. Sorry not to bring more good news, but try to get off them asap as soon as your tummy is a bit better. There are more natural ways of reducing inflammation rather than steroids, but you would have to go and see an ND rather than an MD..######U guys have crohns? What kind of symptoms did you have that brought it about? let me know. Thanks######Plutoren12, One of the main things that made my family concerened about my health was that I have been underweight pretty much my entire life. Other symptoms were chronic diarea (I had it for like 4 or 5 months stragiht before the figured out what it was) Some rectal bleeding, a low grade fever usually at night, abdominal pain (usually after eating, but can be other times) and a pretty small appetite. MY family has also had a history of Crohn's (My uncle had it) I response to everyone else, I guess I 'm having good luck so far with prednisone! I havent experianced and side effects yet except I 'm a little emotional, and my face gets flushed a lot. But I only started at 40mg a day and every 2 weeks my Doctor is taking me down 10 mg, until I get down to 5mg a day, then I 'll stay at that. So it 's good i wont have to be on it for a long time! - Madeline######My younger brother has had Crohn's since he was 6 years old and is almost 16 now. He has been on Prednisone basically at least once a year except for a couple of years in middle school when he did n't get sick. But he has gotten a flare up every single winter since he was in 1st grade and diagnosed with it. Prednisone was what he was on a lot to control it. I guess I do have some words of encouragement. As for the puffiness, when Mike was a little kid, like between the ages of 6 and 9, his face blew up to the point where it did n't even look like him anymore. Living with him day in and day out, we did n't notice it as much... But looking back at pictures from when he was younger and on the steroid, he did n't even look like the same person. But he was on this medication last year again, when he was 14/15 years old, and it did not cause him that moon face that he had as a little kid. He also was not on as high of a dose, however, I think it is because he was older and his body took it better. When he 's not on Prednisone, and especially during a flare, his appetite is essentially non-existent. He does n't enjoy eating at all. On prednisone though, he used to wake my mom up at 6AM full of energy, starving for breakfast. It alters his personality a little bit, in that his appetite basically triples and his energy is through the roof. Yes, acne can be a side effect, and there may be others, just like any drug. But just remember that this helps you It always got rid of his flares and helped him heal, and that 's what we all wanted for him. Do n't worry girl, you 'll be aight######Hi Madeline, I am 40 years of age and have had Crohn's since I was 17 but only diagnosed 9 years ago. It took a long time to find out what was wrong. It is very hereditary as my 4 other brothers and sisters all have either Colitis or Crohn's or both. We all have different symptoms, mine was the most severe as I was the only one with pain. I have been on Prednisone and a relatively new drug called Entocort (mild to moderate) and is a steroid. It did not help. The prednisone did help, I am overweight but did not get the moonface, everyone reacts different to meds. I felt great on the prednisone but then I was on it too long and I have weak muscles and nerves and hopefully should go away. Dont stay on Prednisone too long. As for the diahrea, get your doctor to prescribe Cholestyramine, it works, I take one pack a day, it takes like crap but it stops you (within 2 hours) from going contstantly and takes the cramps away. Dont ever pick up smoking and alcohol, they irritate the bowels more, avoid caffein as well. Chew your food well and small quantities 5-6 times a day. I have had surgery 8 years ago and was perfect up to about 2 years ago and now I need to have it done again. I hope this helps, there will be a cure, think positive and good luck in the future. Penny######I have Crohn's and I am on prednisone. I did n't get acne but I do have a puffy face ``chipmunk cheeks '' and my stomach is also bigger and puffy. I was taking up to 120mg a day but I 'm only on 10mg a day and next week I 'll be down to 5mg. The prednisone has also made me pretty cranky and very irritable. I guess it has helped the Crohn's but I 'll be so happy to be off it. I 've also had increased hair growth. (This message has been edited by popsicle (edited 12-07-2002) .)######I have now been on prednisone for 5 weeks, and i am feeling SOOO much better, and I have gained 10 lbs !! YAY !!! im only up to 90 lbs... but hey, thats better than 80! And i have gottena little puffy in the face, but everyone else says it looks good. . so i am SO happy! thanks for the replys!######I am 42 and was diagnosed in October with Crohn's... I was sick many years and being miss diagnosed over and over... I am getting a new drug called Remacaid Infusion Treatments every few weeks... and I also take Imuran and Asacol... All cramps and diarea have stopped... I am going on my 3rd treatment... but I still have to be careful what I eat or else... I went from 128 lbs. to 102 lbs. in 6 weeks... I am still at 102... but I stopped losing... the meds I am on cause loss of appetite... so some times I force my self to eat... I am still looking for answers to what causes Crohn's... no one is quiet sure... my doctor told me I have an over-active immune system that caused it... some research blames stress... but I do n't think stress causes Crohn's... I think Crohn's causes stress... My prayers go out for all of you. ------------------ Anastasie######I know it 's a few years later than when you posted this... but I am 24 and was just diagnosed with Crohn's a few months ago. None of the treatments have worked for me so far so they are trying the Remacaid Infusion Treatments. I was wondering how they worked for you. If they seemed to help at all. If you felt a little more like yourself. I have a beautiful daughter to take care of and I 'm finding myself in the bathroom almost all day and very fatigued (falling asleep while playing with her) and very tense. I 'm hoping to hear some good stuff about this new treatment they are presenting to me. I think I 'm starting next week. Hope all is going well with the control and treatment of your disease! Thank you for your time.######Remicade was great I felt so much better. HOWEVER... what doctors fail to tell you is that Remicade can cause scarring or strictures to form and the you may need surgery to relieve the area. I was just released from the hospital because of my stricture that caused and obstruction. I choose not to have the surgery for now and pted to have a balloon procedure. Talk to your Doctor about thsi. There really is very little info on the downside of remicade (which is why I decided to take it...) Good luck!######hi this is a good post im 15 years old and the doctors think i have some kind of IBD, i had a colonscopy done in may and they lost my biopsie results so now i have to go threw the colonscopy and a endoscopy again and it hurt so much last time im absolute dreading it! if anyone can give me some information about IBD i would appreciate it thanks.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Liver lesion and swollen lymph nodes... diagnosis taking FOREVER..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis######My husband has been suffering badly for a year... miserably for six months... he ca n't function, even on Azacol and Prilosec (although they are at least keeping him from lying in bed in the fetal position). One surgeon could n't conclude any diagnosis, and said that sometimes removal of the appendix will mysteriously ``cure ' the patient. He did remove the appendix and release an adhesion, which we had hoped was the problem, but since that surgery, the symptoms are MUCH worse. Symptoms: \* Upper to mid-right quadrant abdominal pain \* Diarrhea every time he eats (it was constant prior to starting Azacol and Prilosec... he had to keep a bucket with him in his vehicle!) \* Sometimes he complains of an acid feeling in his stomach \* Fatigue \* Joint pain \* Swollen armpits (one doc thought this was from bacteria, but we feel strongly that it 's lymph nodes. \* Weight GAIN (from this problem directly? or maybe just from being so inactive because of the fatigue?) \* Depression When I look back, I would wager to say that he had early symptoms as far back as 8 years ago. His gall bladder was removed about 3-1/2 years ago. The internal disease specialist just did an abdominal CT scan, and found a lesion on the liver and ``prominent '' lymph nodes. They have an MRI scheduled, additional bloodwork (to see if something shows up regarding the liver), and also scheduled a colonoscopy (although he had one a year ago that showed nothing). Anyone have a thought on this? I 'm all ears! Thank you for taking time to read my post.######Im just looking through some posts and i came across yours. I feel very sorry for the both of you. I am going through a similar problem, it has ruined my life for the past year, and because of it im now a ``nutcase '' of panic disorder and depression. So i can surely relate. ive gotten so i cant even do more testing due to the panic and depression. He has diarhea immediately after eating? And yet he has gained weight? His colonscopy was clean yet he is taking asacol? You said the two meds help, but i wonder how he would be without the asacol. Maybe its the other that is helping. Asacol is a strong aspirin related medication. One of its biggest side effects is actually causing colitis. If you are sensitive to aspirin, it would also cause many effects similar to an allergic reaction, which could include joint pain, swollen glands etc.. Im not saying this is the case, but if you havent tried the stomach med alone, it might be worth a try. The only other thing that comes to mind is that much of it sounds like an infection of some kind. Im sure he was tested, but that can be hard to narrow down. I sincerely wish you and your husband the best. I too am a husband, ive lost my business to a similar condition, lost my mind, and almost lost my family. I know how it feels to try to sleep feeling this bad, and the thoughts that run through your mind. May God help and heal you both.######Asacol is used in ulcerative colitis to treat inflammation in the large intestine. Asacol is one form of mesalamine- other forms include Pentasa and Rowasa. Asacol is used as a maintenance drug- it is helpful in retaining a remission but not in supressing a flare-up. It is typically, but not always, used for ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis and also crohns. It is a anti inflammatory med. just wondering why the doctor prescribe this med? usually its only given if one is found to have crohns or colitis.######He could have an intestinal blockage, maybe from the enlarged lymph nodes obstructing the bowel. Weight gain can happen with this because not much is moving through the GI tract. Diarrhea (and abdominal pain) are typical of intestinal obstructions. Or, the liver ``lesion '' (whatever that means... one of those nonspecific terms doctors like to use) could be significant. A lot of liver diseases cause an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which can then cause pain, weight gain, and digestive disturbances. Has he had any abnormal bloodwork results so far?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Gallbladder, liver, or Crohns?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis######I posted this already in the Gallbladder section, but I think it is equally or more suited here with those who have Crohn's disease and might be able to help. Hi. I 'm 24 years old and I 've been experiencing chronic abdominal pain in the upper right area of my abdomen, underneath my ribs for 3 months now. The pain is constant, and is accompanied with a lot of gurgling and a pressure that feels like there is a balloon inside. I have n't noticed any relation to anything I eat, it is pretty much constant, and I rarely have diarrhea. I have had almost every test done with inconclusive results, so I 'm looking for any suggestions here. My HIDA scan reported an ejection fraction of only 14%, but I have had two gastroenterologists tell me that my symptoms do not mimic common gallbladder issues and they do not believe it is the source of my pain. CT scans and ultrasounds have not shown any gallbladder stones or noticeable inflammation. The other tests that came back abnormal are a high bilirubin level in the blood (3.0 in the last test), a borderline low Vitamin B12 level, and a positive indicator on an IGG test. I have had an EGD, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy all of which did not find anything. With all of this, my gastroenterologist has diagnosed with me Crohn's disease and put me on Prednisone and Asecol HD medications. She admitted that Crohn's disease can sometimes be hard to diagnose and she ca n't confirm that is actually what is wrong with me. Is there enough evidence to be treated for Crohn's disease? Can it still be a gallbladder problem even though my symptoms are n't the same as the general gallbladder symptoms? What does a bilirubin level of 3.0 mean? Can my high blood pressure medicine, Bystolic, be related to any of this? My biliribuin was 0.9 in 2009 before starting BP medicine. Should I be doing more or just take the prednisone for the next 8 weeks? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated since I have had a few doctors testing me for months without anything conclusive.######I would get a second opinion before I started taking steroids and Asacol. It could be crohn's but with nothing showing on any of the test that is a reach in my mind. It would be like telling someone with a pulled muscle they have crohn's and starting tratment- she has the same amount of proof... Get a second opinion first, and ask your primary about the side effects of your pills. Also I assume that you have had your blood tested in the last three years while on the meds, ask your doctor to look at your levels over that time- see if they went up....######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

In December of 2006 I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis (UP) via a colonoscopy. Two sigmoidoscopies later, the diagnosis still stands despite multiple courses of oral medication, suppositories and enemas. In fact, since my original diagnosis, my condition has never gone into remission and not a day has passes that I haven t bled. I am 21 years old. At this point, my (second) gastroenterologist suggests prednisone; however I am very reluctant to accept his offer considering the harsh side effects associated with it. More so, I m very reluctant to believe that prednisone is my saving grace considering NOTHING has worked thus far. I ve read that some Ulcerative Proctitis patients, much like those of Ulcerative Colitis, will not respond to medical treatment. Why is this? I ve asked both of my GI s if surgery was an option for extremely stubborn UP, to which they both said No way. Why? Could it be that removing the affected colon is the only option for even some UP patients as well? Has anyone ever heard of surgery for UP patients? To this extent, I would like to ask you if removing the affected colon (in Ulcerative Colitis) CURES the patient of all the food sensitivities/allergies that usually accompany UC and UP, both of which are autoimmune diseases. As is the nature of such diseases, many patients (myself included) become allergic to common foods almost overnight or at least it seems this way. In May of 2007, an allergist confirmed (via skin-testing) allergies to gluten, milk, yeast, sugar, eggs, corn, sunflower, banana and spinach, all of which were once consumed on a regular basis (some more than others) with no ill-response from my digestive system. However, soon after contracting UP and to this day, consumption of all aforementioned foods result in what can be described as nothing other than an unpleasant experience. Sublingual drops, prescribed to lessen my body s autoimmune response, have done little to do so. So, I ask again. To anyone who can relate did surgically removing the affected colon wipe clean the food allergies that came with your Ulcerative Colitis/Proctitis? Is this logical to assume? My theory as to why my UP has been extremely stubborn is because the root cause has not been addressed. That is, my newfound food allergies (which are nearly impossible to avoid mind you but I do my best) are keeping my UP alive and well because even the slightest introduction of any of them into my digestive tract is enough excuse to cause a flare up. My question then is what ARE my options? I thank you in advance.######Proctitis is Ulcerative colitis there are 5 different types of it, what you have only affects the lowest part of the rectum UC can be treated for flare-ups and remission but it ca n't be cured unless you were to have the whole colon and rectum removed and have a colostomy bag. But surgery is only considered for those not responding to medicine, poorly responding to different medicine for a few years or when at risk of developing colon cancer. There is not enough proven evidence of what causes UC it just happens from abnormal activation of the immune system. So there is no point holding on for hope it 's going to go away by finding an underlying problem, because that is your diagnosis so that is the problem you need to concentrate on treating. Your food allergies have nothing to do with the UC because it is limited to your rectum your food has already been turned into waste before it reaches the affected area. There is no scientific research or back up that different foods causes a flare up unlike in Crohns disease. I have left sided UC which started when i was 18, i 'm 20 now so i know all too well how frightening and disturbing the symptons are at a young age. But i was not diagnosed with it for another 7months when i had an endoscopy and luckily enough i had an appointment with my specialist the morning after i had a very very bad attack of my UC. I was put on Prednisoline (400mg) as a quick fix because anything ibuprofen based irritates my bowel. I was also put on Melasalazine a slow release anti inflammatory tablet, within 2 weeks i was back to normal and had my first solid bowel movement with no blood or cramps in 7 months. But then the Prednisoline side effects kicked in in the 6th week, everything listed i had, weight gain, fatigue, achey joints, puffy face, eye infections, hair loss, acne! Nightmare. So i stopped taking them and withing 6 hours i couldnt move my body was stiff and sore i was blacking out. . nobody told me i had to be weaned off them but within an hour of taking the Prednisoline i was fine. I went to see my specialist who said he would wean me off them gradually then just try me with the Melasalazine, the steroids are only a quick fix and permanent effects only take effect after 6 months of taking them. I strongly advise you try them because medication is the only thing thats going to help you. I was very vain and stopped taking all the medicine because i 'm a dancer and part time model so acne and hair loss from the melasalzine did not fit in with my lifestyle and wow did i put my body through hell. But since breaking my foot 4 weeks ago i have found that drug abuse was the cause of my UC and i really really regret being so stupid. Maybe this website will help you more (url) http://www.medicinenet.com/ulcerative_colitis/article.htm[/url] Hope i was of some help, good luck x######Thank you for your prompt (and thorough) reply CandyKiss! Truth be told... I thought I was quite young for my diagnosis... but you have me beat by 2 years! Perhaps I was n't clear in my initial post. I have in fact tried both oral and rectal medications, as well as varying combinations (Asacol, Lialda, Rowasa, Canasa and Cort-enemas) to no avail and certainly no remission. The only medication I have n't tried yet is Prednisone. Your testimony has made me second-guess my stubbornness, however. It also seems like you have found a root-cause for your UC (drug abuse)... I am still scratching my head on that one. My dad and grandfather (dad's side) both had polyps and that same grandfather was just diagnosed with Colitis... so I guess there 's my excuse. Thanks, Dad! I would n't be so quick to say that foods aggravate UC/UP symptoms, however, even if leading research does not support this. Prior to my diagnosis, I could eat anything and everything care-free. Do n't be fooled: I am very slim, having the advantage of a fast metabolism, and have always been very health-conscious. Now, post-diagnosis, all foods that I 'm apparently ``allergic '' to can not be consumed without a revolt from my bowels EVERY time. This can not be a coincidence. Think about it: we 've covered that UC as well as UP are autoimmune disorders. Logically, this seems to give my theory some leverage as it is presumed that, in such scenarios, our immune systems are already dazed and confused. Mind you my food allergies seemed to appear concurrently with the onset of my UP. This too... can not be a coincidence. I know gluten seems to be the scapegoat for every disease under the Sun nowadays... but there seems to be compelling evidence out there that a strict gluten-free diet is paramount for healing in certain individuals. Some testimonies of this can even be found on these boards (see: (url) http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=588959[/url]). Keeping track, I do not believe that my UP's location makes it immune, so to speak, from flare-ups triggered by food (if we can agree that it is capable of doing so) as an autoimmune response could very well be initiated the moment a ``trigger food '' enters the alimentary canal (mouth to anus). The response could then either single-out the already-compromised section of intestinal wall (the rectum, in my case) OR... the response could be far more generalized and widespread... it 's just that the weakest link in the chain (i.e., my UP-infested rectum) succumbs because it can not ``defend '' itself properly. If I 've made no sense thus far... then consider this: why do people who are VERY allergic to certain foods (say shellfish, for example) breakout in hives? Did the shell fish have to physically touch the skin... or is the reaction coming from within? Similarly... is it the actual of peanut butter with the esophagus that causes it to close in individuals who are severely allergic to it? Or... is the source of the reaction taking a more behind-the-scenes approach? The same scenarios could be applied to airborne allergies. My point is this... it makes perfect sense to me that a local reaction can be caused by a trigger (be it food or whatever) that is not. It also makes perfect sense to me that a food could be this very trigger in some individuals, especially when dealing with autoimmune disorders where the immune system is already compromised and assumed ill. Why could n't the immune system, then, erroneously respond to something harmless and cause a domino-effect reaction? Why is food only allowed to be a trigger in Crohn's Disease? Are n't Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis closely-related in principle? I also could n't help but to notice a healthy dose of cynicism in your reply, in regards to curing my disease. While I 'm well aware UP is currently ``incurable '' by every stretch of the definition, I would still hold out hope that some radical, back-alley Chinese medicine doctor may have to key to our digestive woes. Perhaps I 'm not jaded by the disease just yet... but I refuse to believe that Prednisone and a couple tightly-crossed fingers are my only options left. We always have to consider... what if prednisone just does n't work? What if my UP is just too ``far out of reach '' (cause its RIGHT at the anus) for any oral medication to do any damage? Perhaps it 's the Anatomy & Physiology courses talking... but if there 's one thing I 've learned it 's that the human body, and its inherent processes, are amazing, precise and (above all) smart. I want to believe that my body is constantly trying to heal itself, inside and out, and is ``consciously '' trying to resolve my digestive woes. Perhaps it needs a little help... and perhaps that help will be in the form of Prednisone... but that does not mean there 's a better alternative out there, somewhere. In addition to seeing two GI's, I 've sought the advice from a local family practice who substitutes vitamins and herbs for conventional medicine. Their suggestions have far from cured me... but they 've slightly. That 's got ta stand for something.######I can see the logic your trying to make of it, Food residues which have not been digested and absorbed in the small intestine pass down into the lower bowel and are fermented by the bacteria that live there. It is believed that an immune reaction against the bacteria living in the bowel is a very important factor in the cause of Crohn s disease and that the activity of these bacteria can be modulated by diet. Diet does not work in Ulcerative Colitis, because the bacteria involved rely not on food residues but on substances which naturally occur in the bowel, such as mucus, for their energy requirements. The reaction to foods is quite different to allergy where special antibodies are circulating in the blood. This means that skin \*\*\*\*\* and blood tests for allergy are of no help in deciding which foods need to be avoided. From when i was diagnosed with UC i was not told for another 3 months i would have it for life even though i had read it on so many websites but i did n't want to believe it. Maybe your not happy with my reply because i have stated i think it was caused by drugs (i do n't even know if it is the case, but i would like to think now i have stopped taking drugs i wo n't have any more flare-ups because i have been fine for 4 weeks \* fingers crossed \* but only time will tell. Wishful thinking really. All the information i have gave you has come from the many websites i looked at, as you have probably done. I think maybe your confusing your food allergy reactions which will cause bowel movements, cramps, flatulence with the UC. The UC flare-up is the inflammation (ulcers) and when it gets irritated for example wind or passing a bowel movement the bleeding occurs. The food has already been broken down before it reaches your affected area, the foods wont effect you until they are in or are passing/ passed through the effected area and at the rectum you would already be passing the food. It ca n't cause a reaction until it has reached the effected area. I went to a chinese doctor... firstly he told me i had a lot of heat inside me by looking at my red tongue (i had been drinking cherryade) then he told me my problem was with my liver. The stuff he wanted to sell me would have cost 65 a week, if i knew it was the cure i wouldnt think twice. Apologies if i have offended you in anyway, its worth giving the prednisoline a go before considering surgery unless the UC really effects your quality of life. Even if it gets the main flare-up under control so you can re-introdce the other medicines. Its just a shame either way you have to deal with unwanted symptons. Good luck, let me know how it goes if you want to chat. I 'm an open person all my family/ friends know the insides out of my bowel movements, funny enough they do n't seem as interested in it as me lol######This is such interesting reading. I was diagnosed with Proctitis two months ago (just before my 30th birthday after 2 months of bleeding), and I never understood why my doctor said that food does n't effect my condition. It seemed clear to me that it did, but candykiss's comments are opening my eyes. There are two things that make me go to the bathroom before I would naturally have to go- coffee and a hangover. I thought for sure that hard alcohol and coffee were keeping me from getting better, but now I see that its the going to the bathroom more frequently that 's keeping me from getting better. And I was going more frequently when I 'd have coffee or too much alcohol. This is also true of overeating or having too much fatty/proceesed foods. Basically, anything that makes you go to the bathroom more (and therefore aggravate your ulcers) is going to prolong your flare-up. Now obviously using the right medicines to complement my efforts is a necessity, but am I thinking on the track? I 'm trying to understand this disease to help treat it, but this is all so new to me. What you do you think?######I had ulcerative colitis, at the age of 14, ii was a health enthusiast. I played football at county level, and one day i just got pains, i was cramping up soo bad. I was crying becuase it hurt so bad, oh becuase i was ill and i did n't know what happening to me,, i went to my local hospital and they sent me home with a few painkillers. i didnt get any better,, so i went back and had my appendix out, stupid idiots thought it was the end of my troubles but noo, they sent me homee, again with a few painkillers,, i got even worse, so once again my mum drove me up to the hospital and they kept me in, i got put into a private room becuase they thought i had a super bug (which i didnt) and i went to the toilet and blood came out of my stool, i was SCARED, soo scared i didnt know what was going to happen,, i thought i was dying. The sent me up to a specialist hospital where i had an endo-scope, this revealed i had thickening of the bowel. i got worse and worse, i was going to the toilet over 17 times a day, each time losing blood, and weight, everything i ate went straight through me, by the end of my 1st month there i looked like a walking skeleton, and i was 6 stone, and that 's not good for some1 6foot1. nothing worked, it was hope that we all knew wouldnt work, steriods didnt work. . my consultant was away for a week doing a semenar in Liverpool, so they sent an adult Peadeatricion to see me, and he said yeah, you need your bowel out, i cried once againn. so it came D-Day, Friday the 13th of April 2007, it went well the operation, i was gaining weight fast and my ileostomy worked fine, and the suddenly i got illl, pain like before,, and i went down for ultrasounds and scans and it revealed collections of sepsis. so i went for emeergency surgery at 4 am, i got kept asleep for 36 hours. when i was in intesive care, the nurse said to my mum '' there 's a high chance your son wont live '' and it was hell, they were treating me with drugs and one day i started fitting, once again, everything going wrong, losing weight, becuase i was on four ice cubes a day, nothing else,, cutting things down. . i had pancreatitis, 26 different scans, fits, urine infection, sepsis, kidney stones and lots more. i came out of hospital and i got better,, my luck was turning. i gained weight slowly but steadily and played football again,, with my Ileostomy, and im a goalkeeper so its goodd for me. i had another operation on the 10th December for an Ileo-anal pouch, and im still waiting for confirmation for my last one. if i can make it,, you can !!######Hi, I was diagnosed with mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (left side of colon) last Monday. I 'm so devastated! I 'm 41 years old. Just 10 months ago I started living again after taking care of my mom with Alzheimer's and in the end lung cancer. I thought I would have a great life at least until I got in my 60's or around there but now, here I am, 41 years old and now I have to take care of myself... a lot more than I used to. Anyway, I was put on Asacol 2 tabs 3 times a day. I started a week and a day ago. How long does it usually take to kick in? I 'm still bleeding and having loose stool occasionally. Tomorrow I have an appointment with my GI doc. She said last week if I was n't better she was going to put me on Prednisone. I do n't want to be on that. I know the side effects are not good. Are there other meds I can take to get this disease under control? Thanks for any advice. I really appreciate it. Tami######I am 41 and was diagnose with Proctitis Colitis two years ago. I have tried enemas, salofalk etc. and nothing worked. As per my doctor, my last option outside of surgery is prednisone which he had warned me of side effects. I started with 60 mg daily for about 4 months and it worked. No more pain, fevers, aches that i use to encounter. After being on it for 6 months, I started getting the puffy face, weight gain, bad mood swings and recently acne on my face. I am now down to 15 mg daily and hopefully will be off it soon. For me, it was worth dealing with the side effects instead of the gruelling pain that I was dealing with daily. There are days, where I dont feel that way. I will start with Salofalk again after I am completely off Prednisone, which I look forward to.######I was reading one of your other posts from a few years ago about your urinary troubles (cloudy, burning, and dribbling) I have all of the same symptoms and I was wondering if you ever found out what was wrong with you.

Also, my feet sweat... I know strange right... does anyone else have this problem?######When exactly do your feet sweat? You might be having a combo of symptoms because of flaring in general... you could try splitting the dosage of Asacol (is it the HD you 're taking?) ... half in the morning, half at night. The gas, bloating is also a symptom of flaring, where your UC is limited and the fact you 're not fully dealing with the inflammation with no rectal meds. It takes a while for the meds to kick in. I got a bit worse when I started taking the meds before I improved... but I was at 20 explosive, razor-like, bloody bms a day. rectal meds, can not stress it enough. I 'm curious what you 're eating in the morning... some foods themselves can cause discomfort. maybe adjusting your diet somewhat can ease some symptoms. It takes a while to get it all worked out. q######Thanks, but that is the thing. I am not having more than 1 BM a day. It is never the same time but I usually have 1 and it is not always soft/lose. I tend to get a bit hyper/hot flashes am hour after taking the Meds. I take 800 MG (1 pill) 3 times a day (B/L/D) and it only really bothers me in the morning. I have had 1 restless night in 2 + weeks. I am not eating anything crazy in the morning, I cant digest whole wheat so I eat 2 slices of white toast with nutella or PB and a banana I have it with a cup of Camomile tea with it but never has caused me any problems. I am wondering if I should not take a dose in the AM...######You could try that. . , but do n't just drop the morning dosage. You get hot flashes/hyper after the med each time... or only in the morning? Remember that the Asacol is n't dissolved in the stomach, it 's dissolved in the colon and can take many hours to even get there... so in reality, your morning dosage probably is n't the culprit. If it were the Asacol, it would be throughout the day, not just one time. It ``could '' quite easily be your camomile tea. q.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Basically what she said was that it acts as a natural stomach coater, it also helps with digestion and heartburn (and inflammed muscles for those who have nasty chest and back pains) to ease that icky burning up the esophagus. If you 're going to try it, make sureee and i ca n't stress it enough that it 's Deglycyrrhizinated licorice, because if it 's glycyrrhizinated then it may give u high blood pressure. So far it seems to relax my GERD quite a bit, it may not be a complete solution to medication but it 's worth a try. Anyway, take care.######Yes, licorice is good medicine. So is ginger, by the way.######It helped me a lot.######Another great natural cure is apples and similarly, apple cider vinegar.

It also helps other things like your digestive system and stuff. You can buy them at herb and vitamin stores.######next time you have heartburn, drink the freshly squeezed juice of one lemon. it 's an instant cure. just do n't add sugar or anything otherwise the results are different######DGL works great for many stomach problems including reflux, however, it works differently than how the OP describes. Here is a link to a good description: http://www.ehow.com/way_5523047_dgl-work-c ure-acid-reflux. html I used DGL for several weeks while fighting GERD; it is much better than any standard OTC med, with few if any side effects. Oddly, I had one, probably the only person ever, but when I took it at the full recommended dosage before every meal, it cut back on my sleep. After I figured this out, I started cutting the pills in half and that cured the sleeping problem and DGL still took care of the stomach.

I went searching for the answer and found the following information: Ask Dr. Mark Babyatsky What 's the Difference Between Acid Reflux and GERD? Q: Is there a difference between acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)? I have been reading about GERD, and the term ``acid reflux '' comes up a lot. Are they the same thing? -- Janis, New York A: Acid reflux simply means that acid made by your stomach's cells backs up through the lower esophageal junction (where your esophagus and stomach meet). At low levels, acid reflux is a normal part of digestion and movement along the gastrointestinal tract. In normal patients, acid reflux can cause symptoms such as heartburn, but it is not considered to be a disease. Avoiding foods that trigger acid reflux, such as fatty foods, coffee, chocolate, etc, will help relieve any symptoms it causes. GERD, on the other hand, is characterized by an abnormal frequency or amount of reflux. It can result in heartburn, hoarseness, chest pain, and, rarely, asthma, and may be associated with Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer. The bottom line: Acid reflux is the backing up of stomach acid, while GERD is a disease state of which acid reflux is part..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Acid Reflux

It sounds like some type of digestive problem and you do n't want to wait too long because it could turn into something worse than heartburn.

Last year I had a few distressing episodes where fluid was coming up from my stomach when I 'd try to eat, and into my mouth, but it was n't acidic at all. It did n't burn at all. Soon after that, I read a book about the condition where a person produces too little stomach acid to digest their food properly (hypochloridia), and many of the symptoms were the same as too much acid. Since the reflux did n't burn, and antacids had never worked on my heartburn, I started taking a stomach acid supplement called betaine HCl. I have n't had any more episodes of reflux, nor any sort of indigestion problem at all unless I forget to take the pills when I eat. I mentioned this to my doctor, who seemed completely uninterested since I was n't needing a cure at this point. As I was browsing this site, it occurred to me to ask if my original premise was sound- that since my reflux did n't burn, then I had low stomach acid. I drank some lemon juice, just to compare, since stomach acid is supposed to be even stronger than lemon juice, and the lemon juice really hurt my throat. I was sore for two days. Low stomach acid seems to be my problem- since the recommended cure works. But I 'm still interested, does acid reflux burn?######When I have episodes of acid reflux, it burns a little when it comes up, but then for a few hours afterwards, my throat feels sore, kind of like a burning feeling. But possibly yours could still be related to acid reflux of some sort. All of those stomach/digestive issues can sometimes be all related.######i BELIEVE IT BURNS VERY BAD, I HAD SEVERAL EPISODES WHERE THE ACID COMES UP WHILE IM SLEEPING, AND WOW IT HURTS REALLY BAD AND CAUSES ME TO CHOKE.

I was diagnosed with reflux disease after a year of copious amounts of vomiting and tearing a whole in my esophogus. Last year my reflux got bad again. I was having trouble swallowing and choking and reflux when I laid down. I also became a pretty severe asthmatic. I got infections constantly. My GI put me on anti-emetics and Reglan to try and control my reflux, but two pH probes both done on meds (One Nexium, one Prevacid) still showed a lot of reflux. As a result I was referred to a new GI doctor to get a second opinion, since I was beginning to look like I needed a full fundo. The new doctor, without even having my whole charts there undiagnosed my reflux, saying he has seen worse pH studies (or course, those were done off meds and he did n't give me a chance to say that I was on meds for mine). He decided the meds were no more than placebos and told me to seek the help of a mental health professional to deal with my hypochondriacism and anxiety syndrome causing my symptoms. He told me he wanted me off all my meds. Anyways, I was totally shoked by that after years of hearing that I was a very severe refluxer. I was even told to learn to live with the symptoms, because there was no way they could medicate me anymore and surgery is unlikely to work. I decided for a trial to go off my PPIs. I never had heartburn before (just a refluxy feeling and vomiting). I have started vomiting again, only now I have this constant burning feeling in my chest. And I mean constant. I 'm also getting a lot of sore tastes in my mouth. I never had this before with my reflux. Has anyone else not had this before PPIs, and now has it if they go off PPIs. I mean, it really hurts and is constant. I 'm afraid to sleep because I 'm so afraid I 'm gon na choke on reflux. Does it sound like I have become totally dependant on PPIs? BTW, I have gained a significant amount of weight since going on PPIs four years ago. I have grown taller and no longer am vomitimg 4 times a day. I ca n't see my original GI doctor much longer because he is pediatric.######Please, if anyone has even a few thoughts I appreciate it.######weight gain is know to make reflux worse, so it maybe that ur symptoms are worse now. . then when u first started taking the medicine because of the weight gain. im would be very skeptical of a doctor who diagnoses you as a hypocondriac... the doctors just being lazy. i dont even know if its even possible to diagnose hypocrandrasism.######Yeah, I decided never to see that doctor again. I know weight gain makes reflux worse, but my symptoms are different, not worse. I 'm not vomiting as much (once or twice a week, as oppse to several times a day when I was first diagnosed).######I would get a second, and third opinion, from other Gastroenterologists, who specialize in reflux and related issues. My Mother is currently having terrible reflux symptoms, although hers are `atypical ' she is told- having lightheadedness and trembling. Doctors have had her take a catscan of the head (found nothing), complete blood work (found nothing), urine test (found a vaginal infection and has been put on Diflucan and some antibiodic to kill infection), EKG, etc.. Her GI doctor said her Protonix rendered itself ineffective, and thus, has now given her AciPhex, which seems to be helping mildly, but she still has the lightheadedness and seems to need to eat every 2 hours (very lightly and a very restricted diet). When in doubt, all Doctors seem to point to anxiety-ridden issues. I wish you the best of luck, Lori######Yep, I had a doctor suggest that my GERD was anxiety related a couple of years back and it of course was n't due to that, although I think it 's obvious that anxiety can make my symtoms somewhat worse for short periods of time.######There is no doubt in my mind that stress makes my reflux worse. I readily admit to that, and even changed schools I went to over it (I went to an Ivy league straight out of high school, and the stress was gon na kill me. I am now much happier at a smaller, less competitive school, and still will leave with a degree worth something). HOWEVER, there is also no doubt in my mind that I have reflux disease that requires treatment.######So your wondering if it is still reflux because your symptoms are different. . I (not a doctor at all) would still bet its reflux because your symptoms sound like reflux which gets into your throat and even your lungs a little bit. I can imagine. . that a change in body shape or structure could change how far up the reflux goes.######I 'm also wondering if I should ask for a pH probe off meds. I have had two, and they are miserable, but both were done on meds. Both showed significant reflux ON meds, but not huge amounts, since I was on so many meds. As a result, no one knows how bad my reflux is naturally.######Hi, I was in youre shoes with a GI who told me to ``live with it ''. I aksed my GP to book me an appoiment with a surgen, as a backup I contacted the mayo clinic in regards to the Stretta procedure. I was offered the fundo my the surgen and was told by the GI (one of the top GI's in the US) at the mayo clinic that I was a good candidate for the stretta. It is youre life so do what you must...!######Yeah, I guess I need to see more doctors. How did you go about finding your sugeon? Did you see a surgeon who specializes in fundos?######Hi, here in Canada the fundo's are performed by general surgeons. I have noticed in the U.S that they have surgeons that specialize in fundos- prob because of the private health care system. My surgeon has done hundreds of these over 20 or so years. I would try and get a surgeon who has been pratcing for 10 to 20 years... not too old and not to young! I just complained to my family doc and they made the referal. The surgeon will then look at all the tests you have had, and may ask you to repeat some of them. He will definatley re-scope you! If you need any more info etc.. . let me know... Also look into the stretta and the plicator, they seem to be the best out of the alternative procedurs... What country are you in ??######I 'm in the US. I 'm not a candidate for the stretta or plicator because of my age. My doctor told me he has never had anyone not back on meds after one year of a fundo. Is it because he is a peds GI? I know people here have gone longer. Honestly, that 's the only reason I have n't had a fundo yet. I 'm soooo sick of being sick constantly, and on meds.

There are many cures available to sufferers of heartburn. Most offen times people look at man made cures such as medications, to solve there heartburn woes. Unfortunately, medications do n't treat the problem only the symptom. This is why it is important for you to address the root cause of your heartburn as soon as you can. When I went to the doctor, he prescribed for me an over the counter (OTC) medicine. Yes it worked in the short term, but he advised me that I needed to do other things in order to prevent its return: 1. Lose weight 2. Change my eating habits 3. Excercise 4. Change the foods I ate and when These were the most significant changes I made in order to reduce my heartburn. I searched all over the Internet looking for a guide that would help me to change my lifestyle. I found several guides that helped me to cure my heartburn. They worked for me and today I am heartburn free. Sure I occasionally get a touch of hearburn after a big meal, but this is nothing compared to what I had before!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Acid Reflux

Lately I have been feeling really lost and the more I learn about MS the more it seems to explain some of the things I have been dealing with all my life. I have always had sharp head pains that come and go, which I think are related to the lesions. I get a frequent numbing feeling in my legs that I always thought was normal before. But the part that scares me most is that I feel like my memory is getting worse- it 's something my friends and coworkers have noticed. I consider myself to be a smart girl, was lucky enough to graduate from an Ivy League school and have worked hard to get where I am in my career, so the possibility that I come off as lost or dumb is really upsetting to me. For others dealing with MS, do you suggest any coping strategies for memory loss? I imagine some of my symptoms are normal and I am just dramatizing now that I seem to have a reason for them. I do feel like I need to work twice as hard to process and remember things lately, though, and i do n't know if that 's because of the illness or because I 'm so stressed out about it that I 'm letting it affect my health..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Multiple Sclerosis

I have a friend that was very recntly diagnosed with MS based on a bout of optic neuritis and an MRI that showed a few inactive lesions and one active one. Since I heard the news, I 've been doing some reading up, but there are still a lot of questions that I have. First of all, my friend is female, 27 years old and she had some double vision about a year ago that her physician considers to be probably her first episode. Her doctor put her immediatley on betaseron injections, and from what I have heard from her, he did n't really present her with other options. I have n't really seen too many people talking about betaseron. Anybody have experience with it and how it worked for them, expecially anyone that took it newly diagnosed? Anyone have any recommendations for treatment for someone newly diagnosed that does n't know how their MS will really be affecting them? Does anybody have anything that they regret doing or not doing when they were first diagnosed or that they would change if they could go back and do so?######Betaseron is immunomodulating medicine that is used to prevent further episodes of MS. Corticosteroids as immunosuppressive drugs are also used especially for overcoming the acute attacks of MS. Physical therapy is also used.######I am 37 and was diagnosed in 2000. I too use the betaseron and started it immediately after being diagnosed. I am doing well on the drug, except for redness at injection sites! no flare-ups!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Multiple Sclerosis

The numbness I have had in the past and at the current moment in my finger tips, the muscle weakness in my leg, and now this... loss of vision in my left eye. My symptoms sound like optic neuritis... vision worsens in bright light/ sun light, pain when I look side to side, and just an overall blurry feeling that makes me feel tired and that I am in a cloud. I dont want to have MS, I have seen my brother struggle with it for years, thank god he is doing well now. But I want some explanation as to why these crazy things are happening to me. MRIs were clear. But I am 20 years old and I think I am too young to be falling apart! I just want some answers and try to make these things better... walking is my main problem. My muscles in my left leg get so weak. And now I think my right leg is so tired from doing all the work that they are both getting weak. I find myself falling forward or backwards when standing because my legs are just so tired. Its like i 'm falling and my legs are catching me everytime I take a step. And god forbid I crouch down, I cant get up on pure leg muscle alone... I have to grap on with my hands and pull myself up. I AM 20 YEARS OLD! haha I dont think this is normal... I am in relatively good shape and was always involved in sports in school. Now I have a 3 year old who runs the show and I certaintly get my share of exersize... I just dont get it!######Hi, Sorry for all your pain and problems. I 'm not a doctor but it sure sounds like MS to me... MRIs can be wrong sometimes. I would definately keep trying to get the doctors to find out what is causing the problem. Good luck and God bless.######I to was diagnose with possible M.S. one thing I was told by a women who has it was, you need to stick to a good health diet. No Sugar, and it will help. Has anyone else heard of this?######MRI's can be clear with MS sypmtoms present... lesions showing up later. I sincerely hope you ``do n't '' have it... but IF you do, you \* can \* live well with it. While the medical profession does n't have all the answers to MS yet, it has made great strides. Please keep us informed!######Sweetie I know it 's hard because I experience the same symptoms as you. The only difference is that I was diagnosed with MS. I am 25. I know it 's hard but be strong for yourself and your 3 yr old. I too was extremely active before this. I did track and field, netball and I was on the step team and cheerleading just 4 years ago in college. I havent been able to walk on my own or coordinate my leg and arm muscles for 4 months. I 'm doing a lot better now cause of steriods and meds. Not back to normal but I can move around better and I stopped using my cane 2 weeks ago. Have faith sweetie.

Well, I may not be 23, but I still consider myself young! I 'm 27 years old and have been diagnosed with rrms since september, and looking back, definately know I had ms for about a year before that. I 've had one mri, and had one lesion, but it was on my spine. I 've had two attacks (and more severe) since then, so i 'm sure I must have more lesions by now. Actually, it was b/c I only had a lesion on my spine that my first neurologist could n't definatively diagnose me with ms. But my second neurologist immediately diagnosed me, and she said I was the only case she 's ever seen without a lesion on the brain- but i 'm sure its there now. I 've only been relapse free for a total of a couple of months for the last two years. But, I guess you are progressive, and experience everything differently. I do n't really know about a lot about progressive ms and how it effects the body. Does it come on slowly over the years, or do you get hit with harder attacks as well? Write back if you want! T.######I was a 22 year old college student when I was hit- and hit hard. That may have been 25 years ago but yes there are younger people with ms.######Hi. I 'm 24 and I just found out back in april that I have ms. It all started with hearing loss in one ear and then went on to the right side of my face going numb. I 'm not quite sure how many plaques I have and I could n't tell you what stage i 'm in. All I can say is it all came as a shock to me b/c it does n't run in my family and I do n't know anybody with it. So you are n't the only young person with ms.######I 'm only 24 and was just diagnosed 3 days ago but i 've known in my heart for a while now. I have rrms not the pogressive type. I just wanted you to know that there are young people with ms out here now i 'm glued to my newly acquired high speed connection and just surf the internet finding all the info. I can. I have to decide about meds, lifestyle changes, when to have another kid, all kinds of stuff. My computer is my new best friend######I hear you in the same place right now. Had a relaps last month still not recovered. They want me to change meds. I also do n't know to have another child or not to have if so then when.######It sounds like you are actually suffering from a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Worrying about getting particular diseases is not very productive. Enjoy life now, do the things you want now. You might get ms or cancer or a brain tumour one day. Or you might get hit by a bus tomorrow.######You are an absolute idiot, I wish me being diagnosed with ms was just an OCD. I hope your hit by a bus tomorrow######I am have an obsessive compulsive disorder... So much fun!######Well... It is nothing to worry about really... Maybe it is. I am a perfectionist-although that does not mean I am obessisive compulsive. I do weird things I guess... Like I cant stand it whenever im dirty and my plate needs to be super clean when im done eating. Ive grown out of those tendencies a little because I made myself do it cuz I felt like an idiot infront of everyone (and I didnt know I had ocd when I was younger.) I also have weird muscle things in my legs and neck... Its not a spasm but it always feels like I need to stretch it whenever I think about it. So I stretch it and I look funny-- i never do it in public. Also, when I read a book, I have to reread the same page over and over again until I remember every word perfectly... Its a pain... Especially when I took ap us history and ap language and composition at the same time. Another thing I do is that I get really scared whenever I may think I have something... Like a disease or something of that nature. I think about it nonstop... And I cant help thoughts that come into my mind at all... Same thing with depressed thoughts... I can not avoid them when they start... It just keeps coming obsessively and I cant do anything about it (without medication.) as for the disease thing, I think about what it could be-making it much worse than it actually is- and when I find a computer, I have to look things up-- because the internet is my source to everything nowadays. There a few other sypmtoms that I have from ocd, but I cant think of them at the top of my head. Good luck to you and I hope I helped in some way (not quite sure I gave u any info at all! But thats ok######I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis over a year ago at the age of 19, and I had my first episode at the age of 18 so young people do have problems with multiple sclerosis too. I have had 2 or 3 episodes so far, but otherwise I have been living a normal college student life luckily. If there are any other people out there my age it would be cool to talk about anything really, I do n't think I have ever met anyone with ms, especially my age.######I was just diagnosed last week with RRMS and I am 24. I have had about three attacks over a year and a half span. I knew from my first attack that it was probably MS, but of course you do n't want it to be. I have been surfing the web trying to find forums like this one of young people with MS. I just want to know other young people's progression. I know it affects everyone differently, but you seem the most like me, the episodes have not affected me and I am still the same girl I was before I knew. I have yet to start taking drugs, and I have found what kind of diet I should be eating, what vitamins I should be taking. . and I am hoping doing all of that will dramatically slow down my progression. I would love to keep in contact with you, have someone else my age to talk to about it. (if you even use this website anymore lol).######I thought I was the only person who felt like this... I was only 10 when I was diagnosed with ms.. . None of the doctors knew what it was but once they took a few mri's it was confimerd and they were very confused. That was then this is now... And i 'm 19 and i 'm living, if its possible, happily with my ms. If you need to talk I suppose you could write back, from what i 've experienced so far it 's not such a bad thing- luigi######What scares me the most is that I seem to be the oldest one, i 'm 29 years old, but I was diagnosed at 26 and when I think back and analyze my health I think i 've had it for about ten years now. I have the remitting-relapsing form of ms and I still have to learn to live with it, looking for information in websites like this because the local support is n't really helping. I know that good nutrition and exercise helps a lot, personally yoga does wonders for me. I 'm not a very religious person but I am spiritual and I have faith that I eventually will be fine, and I try to be positive even though it 's really hard when the pain is unbearable but instead of worrying I try to learn as much as I can about it I just make sure I do n't obsses over it so I do n't get depressed. Anyways thanks for listening and if you have any questions you can certainly contact me.######Hi, my name is cecilia and I was diagnoised with ms at 19. I am 23 right now and I can say ive been lucky. Ive only had one episode (my left side went numb and I lost my vision in my left eye). This was the only episode I have ever had. Once I got on my medicaition, betaseron, ive been doing great! I feel fine, the feeling in my left leg pretty much came all back and even some of my vision came back! Trust me, going blind in one eye was so scary! : cry: and all that happened 4 years ago. To all those with ms, keep a positive attitude do everything you can to bring positive energy. The mind is so strong and amazing, its all on how you train it. I truly believe that. Be happy with what you have and live each day as if it was your last! I try to do that. I am still pretty active, I have my days where I dont feel my best, but at the same time... That can really happen to anybody. I do admit, I am scared myself. . I really am... Who knows what lies in our futures... But its important to be positive and stay strong. : d######Oh, wow! I 'm sorry I have not had a chance to respond to anybody's message (s) lately. I 'm sort of happy that I am not alone in this, but sad because I would not wish this disease on anyone. I hope everybody is well, or at least as well as possible. :-RRB- since the last time I was here I have been getting new symptoms such as sharp pain in several areas of my body, trembling, slurred speach, memory loss, and my gait is not as good as it used to be. I am considered impaired by my neurolologist, but disabled by my psychologist. So I do n't know where I really stand there. I am considering trying to find a new neurologist because I feel like she really does not get the fact that I am in pain, and I am getting worse. I guess it may have to do with me being on dshs, but that should not matter. Eh, i 'm on a rant, sorry. Xd anyways, I will try to be more active and reply to you all. Thank you so much for coming forward with your stories, I really appreciate you all for helping me. :)############Im 16 years old and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis several months ago when I was only 15 years old but my doctors told me that my mri's had shown that it looked as if I have had ms before I had shown any primary symptoms of it. Jillianna######Is 29 still young: wink: I was diagnosed with ms when I was 24. I was diagnosed in 1997 with guillan barre right before I was to start my first year of college. It was n't fun having to use a cane for the first month of school but I quickly got rid of it :-RRB- in 2000 I had another attack and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. I do n't take anything for it as I do n't want to put anything into my body until we are finished having children. I did try copaxone a few years back but I had bad site reactions and stopped. The once a day thing was n't for me anyway. I have to say that the best cure for ms is pregnancy. We had our first child (lucas) in january 2004. I felt almost 100% while I was pregnant my ms symptoms slowly started wo come back about 7 months after having luke and i 'm now off on sick leave due to extreme fatigue caused by my ms (a tough decision but it 's helped a lot).

I had my first attack when I was 17 and it was pretty severe. It basically paralyzed me. After that my left side returned to normal, but my right side had a severe intention tremor. I was diagnosed at 18 when I had optic neuritis. I then had an extremely severe attack, which basically destroyed the whole of my left side. The movement has come back, but there is no coordination. I can no longer walk properly either. I am using voice recognition to type this post. I think I have relapsing remitting, but I may have secondary progressive. I have seen about 10 doctors and they are all pretty baffled. I was wondering if anyone in this forum, had an intention tremor and if they knew of any way to help with this? I 'm currently on chemotherapy, but will probably start new treatments in the coming weeks. Like a few others in this forum, I do not know anyone with ms.######Does n't it feel good to share your stories. I ca n't believe there are so many of us out there that are so young, and by young I mean anyone from 10-75. I 'm about to turn 25 on monday. Unfortunately, just last tuesday I was hit hard again, this time I was numb from the waist down. I am taking steroids in a temporary iv for 3 days, tommorrow will be the third day. I am still feeling somewhat numb, and I am walking very funny. My neurologist warned me I may not be the same after this. I 'm afraid I will have to get a cane for my new bad days.######Mehra 66: I was numbed from the waist down when I had my first attack. I had to use a cane for a little bit but not all the time. The cane lasted for about 2 months and then I ditched it. I have n't used one since and that was in 1997:)######I 'm new here... I am 33. Was diagnosed with ms when I was 26. I couldnt figure out what was wrong with me. We all went to a club one night and after a few drinks, I felt tired, but strange tired like I never felt before. My legs felt extremely weak, and I started to walk funny... That and the fact that I was buzzin gave the impression I was completely sh * t faced. : roll: anyways a couple of visits later and a spinal tap from hell, I was diagnosed. I am in denial however cause nobody close to me knows about this (i realize it 's stupid of me) and I choose a quick fix like prednisone (which I am on right now but tapering off cause I feel like i 'm getting better). I 've tried everything vitamins, exercise, not being as stressed out, no more coffee/chocolate, but these only help a little bit. I hate to say this but the only other thing that somewhat helped was a couple years back I stopped eating as much and stuck with non-fat foods, no milk, lots of chicken etc etc.. . Not only did I loose some weight (always a good thing I guess) but I started to feel better... I 'm going to give that a shot again.

Strangest story, I signed him up to be a volunteer for a study with mri's under anesthesia. an incidental finding was 3 small lesions consistent with ms. no symptoms though. he felt fine, we kind of ignored it. several months ago he had some tingling in his left hand. we got married and again kind of forgot about it. last week he had tingling in right leg. repeat mri showed 10 lesions in the brain and 4 on the spinal cord. positive csf. after 5 days of steroids he feels fine and we will start rebif. i am devastated. he is the strongest, most loving, protective man ever and now he has this diagnosis that i ca n't do anything about. i feel helpless. luckily he has a great outlook, he is forever optimistic. me... i cry whenever he is n't around. i 'm being ``strong '' on the outside for him but inside i am totally breaking down. the neurologist gave us a bleak picture saying this many lesions on diagnosis can be bad without treatment, not that is even an option. other neurologists said the meds help so very much and were more optimistic... i guess i 'm just looking for some stories to give me hope. how terrible that I AM the one who needs uplifting. I love him and am totally ok with helping him through all this (he is actually physically totally fine), just bummed and feeling sorry for both of us. thanks for letting me vent.######You have to be strong for him. I just recently got dixed with MS February 8 th, a day i 'll never forget. My husband is so strong and caring for me, he said he married me '' in sickness and in health '' when I was loosing my mind over the fact that I had MS. Just knowing he is there for me and will be the rest of my life, is the best medicine I could ever have. Stay strong, fight this with him. - Moon######Welcome to the board! A lot of the time, MS affects the patients loved ones more than the patient himself. My mom and my friends took my own diagnosis much worse than I did, and my aunt's fiancé also took the news very badly when my aunt was diagnosed. Contrarily to what people think, MS is n't a direct route to a wheelchair. It 's a difficult disease, but it 's also one where progress is being made each day. In the last few years, treatments have evolved dramatically and research results have come flooding in. Rebif is generally very well-liked among patients and is usually very effective, so there 's also hope there.######i agree with arraicha completely. it seems my partner in life is much more devestated then i. ms is NOT a death threat, nor are you necessarily wheelchair bound with ms. i am 56, i have progressive ms and have had it for years. symptoms are many, and no fun at all though i still walk around... admittedly not far any more though i am now old also. when first dx, there were no medicines for ms. mine was not progressive at that time though has been the last 7 years. i imagine what terrible news this must be for both of you just starting a new life together and i encourage you both to read all you can about ms to educate yourselves. . you need to know for both your good. your husband has many choices now with meds and his may almost disapear with the correct treatment. it is not the end, i repeat again. he will do much better with you at his side also. smile as often as you can, think positive and remember the wonderful man you just married wo n't change in character and will always be the wonderful man you married. it takes strength as any illness does, though your strength together will be such a blessing for you both.######Ruggie... I know exactly how you feel for the most part. My husband has no diagnosis yet but will see the neuro in May. He has only had optic neuritis and questionable numbness on two separate occassions. One of those when he was 18 with a Bell's Palsy like numbness, the other in November after raking leaves that is EXACTLY like Cubital Tunnel. The prospect of him having MS is devastating to me. I have severe Rheumatoid arthritis, about ready to undergo knee replacement all at the age of 29. With my problems it has been hard being a cheerleader for him. Like you, I just cry and cry when he is n't home. I am a housewife/mom, how am I suppose to take care of him? If he does progress with MS who is going to take care of me? We have a son. With my RA and his possible MS what have we cursed or son with? It seems, however, with my husband if he does have MS he will probably do OK for a long while since episodes have been far between. The fact that your husband is doing fine is encouraging. My husband has only one lesion show up so far (its been 15 months since last MRI and was one of those OPEN ones so more lesions may be there) but since your hubby seems to be doing physically ok that is great for now. So many medications for MS have usurped flares and have actually reduced lesions. Hang in there Shandi######thank you all who have replied. this site has helped me tremendously, despite my apprehension. upbeat for now!######I know some of you do not want to believe this but there are people misdiagnosed with MS when they really have lyme disease/tick borne diseases. Lyme can cause the same lesions... I know this is not the case with everyone but there is always a possibility so please research this.

Had IV steriods followed by prednisone. A week after my eye went wacky, I developed weakness through out my whole body and my right side is weaker than my left. I was dropping things, tripping, I could n't walk very well. I was shuffling my feet, my arms and legs felt very heavy, I was tired all the time (was napping at least twice a day). I had tingling in my feet and hands which comes and goes. And my muscles tend to be jerky when I used them. I had an MRI, that was negative. An EMG, that was negative. Blood work, which was normal. Today, after two months, I still have these symptoms but they have gotten somewhat better. My doctor is kind of looking at MS but said he wo n't diagnose unless I have another attack. My question is do lesions have to be present in the very early stage of MS? If so, why does it take so long for people to get diagnosed if it is as easy as an MRI?######MRI may not show any brain lesion during the first attack even if there is MS. One attack is not enough to assume MS. At least 2 episodes of neurological symptoms are needed to assume MS. Further tests are requested to diagnose MS: examination of the cerebro-spinal liquor (lumbar punition) and evoked sensory potentials.

Whats that for? So what happens if I do n't have ms and I am on ms meds? Help!######Zewoman, Thanks for sharing! Optic neuritis (ON) can be a standalone problem which may eventually turn into a subset of MS. Not all MSers have or experience ON and not all with ON develop into MS. I think you have to discuss with an MS Specialist or a neuro-ophthalmologist if what you are experiencing is MS or just ON. With the problems beyond your eyes, I would tend to look towards MS. Among MS mimicries, a vitamin D deficiency ranks high on the charts. If you have MS and a vitamin D deficiency, this can cause you symptoms and other health problems. I had low D and now take a daily regiment of 1000 iu/day of D3. The vitamin B addition can help you with your energy levels, but will unlikely impact a full-blown case of MS caused fatigue. The Revised McDonald Criteria requires at least 2 lesions to render a diagnosis of MS. Based upon what you have shared, I would certainly think you have MS, but if you are wary, definitely ask the doctor if what you have is not just ON. Most MS Specialists I have known are happy to explain why they have settled on a diagnosis of MS.######MSJayhawk, The Neuro is specializes in ms and has it himself. When he got my mri I had him show me what he was looking at to see ms. Well it did n't seem like anything to me. But the report also said, findings of scattered regions of T2 signal within perventricular and subcortical white matter with patchy enhancement involving the periventricular white matter bilaterally and enhancement involving the right optic nerve. I will have to ask him that. He loaded me up with a bunch of info that day did n't even think to flat out ask him. Ty######Zewoman, When we are first hit with the news, we can often forget to ask questions. When my MS worsened, I thought ``ALS '' but forgot to ask my neuro. At my next visit I asked and she said that she would never have let me go if I had had ALS. I have found that taking a list of questions with me helps me during my appointment. I prioritize my questions, and if my neuro has covered them, I need not take up any more of her time. She is always welcoming new questions and we talk about new studies, trials, and she will also ask me about my pain remedies. I know that she has shared my remedies with her other MSers. I think it is unique that you have an MS Specialist with MS. It really gives your neuro empathy and insight. In that, I would certainly say you are well blessed !!######Zewoman, Welcome to healthboards. It certainly sounds like you are under the care of a capable doctor. I would think his diagnosis would be legit... especially because what you told us, does meet McDonald criteria. I know its super scary to hear the words '' you have MS '. Almost all of us here have heard them... but its an adjustment. Not a death sentence. We will be here to support you when and if you decide you want to ask questions. . and Im glad you found us. Nikki######I have been reading other posts, what is this about pain managment. And if I remember right how is msjayhawk med free? Or did I miss understand? I am very glad I found this healthboard. Thank you all and I will keep everyone posted. I am currently waiting for meds. Do n't look forward to that. I also read somewhere about when you have a flare up you have to take steroids. What would the steroids be for?######Zewoman, Steroids are used to reduce inflammation. The use of steroids becomes less and less effective as your body builds up a resistance to it. Steroids are well known to cause side effects. I have Progressive MS. There are no meds for me; therefore, I am med free. When I was first diagnosed in 1982, steroids were the only drug available and my neuro at the time warned me to avoid steroids and allow my body to recover naturally and without any side effects. BTW, other than the vitamin D3, I do not take any meds and treat my pain with either my heating pad, cold water, dark chocolate, or Diet Dr. Pepper depending on my specific pain location. There are no meds on the horizon for progressive MS. When a true cure is found, I will be waiting, I will gladly give others ``up's '' in the queue!######Well, I ca n't get a return call from dr about his diagnoises. How and why he thinks I have ms. So I emailed him. He replied with, my diagnois was made by your complaints and mri. ok really. So is it possable that I got the really early stages of ms, enough that I want to pass it on as a fluk? And ca n't beleive what the dr tells me.######I know you were completely taken by surprise and are stunned I do agree with the others though that it sounds like you diagnose is confirmed.######Zewoman, By your ``complaints '' I would assume that he was referring to your symptoms (I hope)! As to complaints + MRI, I think that is too easy. You need to make sure it is MS by having had all other possible mimicries eliminated. With such a response, I would be left with many doubts. When is your next appointment?######MSJayhawk I go back May 31st. But in the mean time I am suppose to start ms meds. I refussed to take a spinal tap because I do n't like needles, but also now because its not 100% accurate. So should I think about getting one anyway? I talked to someone in my commmunity (mser) that goes to the same dr. Says he is good. The other mser i talked to in community says 2nd oppinion. The radioligest that read mri also says lesion that support ms. I hate to have ms and not take meds and get worse, or take meds and not have ms.######Zewoman, I think that you should do what you feel is right in your life. An LP is not a required step in the diagnostic process. I would speak to the doctor about your fears regarding an LP. I would not rely upon a radiologist to interpret your MRI, but if you have any doubt, ask for a second opinion. I remember in 1982 my neuro had files stacked high on his desk which he would review and telephone his second opinion (before the fax and internet !!) . Relax and rest and your appointment will be here soon. Discuss your thoughts with the doctor regarding the meds. Why does he want you to use the med? As he is an MSer, what med does your doctor use? Do not be afraid to ask these things. It is most likely that you have MS, but if you do not feel meds are for you, ask the doctor about alternatives such as LDN or med free. Your decision, whatever it might be is your decision and no pressure should be placed upon your shoulders. Whatever you decide, I will certainly not judge you and you will still have the support of others herein..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

My father has an MS for almost 1O yrs, and Im 21 now and i have also demyelination disease. . I have tingling on my hands and pain in spine, doctors made all the tests but they all were negative, only on MR they found 3 demyelinations in spine and from lumbar puncture they found only high albuminous results... After 2 months they still donÃ Â ´ t know the diagnosis (they are not sure if its MS, it isnÃ Â ´ t borreliosis or meningitis), but they wan na give me Interferon meds even theyÃ Â ´ re not sure of final diagnose... So, please, I need someone if he can help me and answer me if it is necessary to take the Interferon... Thanks######Well it is entirely up to you if you take interferon treatment... I can tell you in my situation I had to wait three months between MRI's to formally diagnose my RRMS & in that time I had eight new lesions pop up--- So they considered my disease to be very active & it was looking like it was quite agressive. A year later after starting the interferon drug therapy I had a repeat MRI and none of the active lesions were active anymore. That is just my take on interferon treatment... It is totally up to you but in my case it was the best decision I could of made. Talk with your doctor more about the pros & cons of starting treatment... Where I live they do n't just give anyone authorization for the treatment unless they have clinical evidence that they are indeed dealing with a probable MS diagnosis..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Multiple Sclerosis

I have nasal polyps and tested positive for mold and other environmental allergies and i have days when everything seems fine but I also have days that i feel like crap. Pressure and/or pain on the face (cheeks, nose and eyes), sometimes even tingling, maxillary sinus pain, upper teeth pain, ear fulness or sometimes pain etc and the doctors I saw said it 's sinus infection caused by allergies so take Allegra D or Zyrtec, use NAsonex, and everything should be ok. As I said, sometimes it is, but sometimes it 's not at all. I 've started seeing a naturopath doctor and I hope it 'll help a little bit, but I was wondering if any of you, the sinus pain sufferer, have any suggestion on what to do to improve my condition. I currently live in a city on the East Coast, with lots of humidity, but we 'll move shortly to Colorado, where the weather is dry and everybody says that this will help my sinus condition. Thanks.######Chronic sinusitis is usually a result of repeated antibiotics being used to treat sinuse congestion. If it is chronic you probably have a systemic candida infection and need to stop with the antibiotics and start with treating the systemic infection. I have had this for many years and finally think i have found the key to treating this thing created by my doctor way back in 1987.######I wo n't get into a detailed argument with the first responder to your post but would encourage you to be extremely wary of that non-scientific advice. The polyps may be the root cause of the infection not clearing. They can block the natural drainage passageways in your sinuses and cause infections to recur almost immediately. Has your doctor recommended anything to help shrink the polyps? Generally a short course of oral steroids followed by the use of a nasal steroid spray and Singulair are pretty effective at keeping polyps from recurring (unfortunately, there is no natural way to deal with polyps, they are difficult to treat and, if not addressed, can require surgery to remove them. Here 's a list: 1. Get a Neil Med Sinus Rinse bottle and irrigate your nasal passages 2-3 times a day. 2. Talk to your doctor about a steroid nasal spray to keep the inflammation at bay during allergy season. 3. Take an antihistamine daily during allergy season (and consider undergoing allergy testing). You really should look for an ENT or allergist who specializes in treating chronic sinusitis so you have someone who can help you manage this (if the ENT recommends surgery right away get a second opinion).######Scientific? I post nothing that is not verified medical fact.######When I lived in Colorado I had the worst sinus infection ever, caused by the dry air and dust. It was Colorado Springs in 1992. I do much better in a moist climate, but that 's just me. At least in Colorado there are good NDs to treat you.######I simply hope that people will take the time to actually verify those ``facts '' before they start thinking that antibiotics contribute to sinusitis. Bacterial sinus infections that are not properly treated with antibiotics can cause serious health problems.######I was given antibiotics and seldane only for my sinuse problems to return a short time later. I now have and have had chronic sinusitis for many years as a result of that witch doctor treatment and have now realized the source of the chronic sinusitis as well as the fact seldane was removed from the market as a dangerous drug. That 's what modern so called scientific medicine has done for me. I suspect you are in medicine and think you guys need to be ashamed of yourselves for what you do to people.######Your suspicions could n't be any more wrong. I have battled chronic sinusitis for 20 years but have had the good fortune to have been treated by 3 incredible doctors (2 ENTs and an allergist) who have helped me get my sinus issues under control. I wasted thousands of dollars on bogus natural treatments before I finally found a doctor who actually specialized in treating chronic sinusitis and I am incredible grateful to him (Dr. Donald Leopold at the University of Nebraska Medical Center) for helping treat and educate me about chronic sinusitis. I do n't want others who suffer from chronic sinusitis to spend the time and money chasing phony hope when there are real, scientifically proven, treatments out there. I certainly understand how people become frustrated because chronic sinusitis is a difficult disease to diagnose and treat, but blaming it on Seldane or antibiotics might just keep someone from getting the help they need to find lasting relief..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

It is Hard for me to concentrate in school, Let alone get to school. . I have missed a week. I was wonering how long these last, And what else I can use to help fight it.######If antibiotics did n't budge the infection, or it returned, it 's possible you are/were on the wrong meds and you need to switch to a differnt antibiotic. Sometimes sinus infections wo n't clear no matter what antibiotics you take if there is a nasal polyp obstructing normal drainage. I once had a sinus infection for 8 weeks, (no antibiotic was helping) and finally a cat scan of my sinuses revealed a polyp. After the surgery to remove the polyp, the impacted infection could drain properly and I was back to normal. Check back with your doctor to find out why you still feel so lousy. zuzu xx######Sinusitis unfortunately is aggrevated alot by weather and other stuff to. If the antibiotic route does n't help... you may need to see a specialist. I suffer from Chronic Sinusitis. I finally broke down to see a specialist a year ago after suffering for an entire winter with head pain. They put me on FLONASE nasal spray and honestly at first I was resistant, but I have had alot of success with it. I have only had sinus headaches one every few months and I usually can take some Tylenol Sinus and I 'm fine. Also, another good idea is to run a cool mist humidifier where you sleep.

Since i was a kid. I used to get alergy shots,, now they tell me they are not needed? My sinus issues are constent, ime miserable even to people as ime just in pain all of the time. I have had 2 diviated septum operations wich has helped as ime rarely stuffy. Ive been to boston, road island, and taunton ma. I cant function corectly, it is so constent i dont do the things i like to do as while doing them ime miserable, Today my ears constently pop-nose constently runs-and achy. This has left my quality of life terrible and no one seems to be able to help me. I have a sinus rince that dont seem to help. I really dont know what to do. I can say maybe 2-3 days per year I am capable of being normal and its so great to feel good but it never lasts.######Hello, and thanks for your medical question on eHealth forum! I am not sure what allergy shots you were getting or why they were stopped. Chronic sinusitis is often allergic and can be due to mold infection too. A damp wall in the house, carpets, and ACs are all potential sources of mold. Please consult an allergy specialist. You may need to take the allergy test. Chronic sinusitis can also be due to EBV infection. The other possibility is deviated nasal septum (this was corrected in your case). Nasal polyps and tumors, worms in stool causing high eosinophil counts, gastric reflux are the other causes. The treatment will be complete only on removing the cause. Hence please consult an ENT specialist (you must already be under one) and discuss these possibilities. Depending on the cause treatment will be prescribed. Hope this helps. Take care!######Ime told i have alergies to mold,, i will contact my dr asap and try it again. Whene i was a kid i had allergies to dogs-cats-dust-drass-oak trees- you name it. Ive been tested later on in life and allot of those went away? This simply stinks to have to live like this every day! Thank You !!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Sinusitis

I have chonic sinusitis and like most people I 've tried a lot of remedies and most dont work like they say. Thanks, Andy######Hello Andy, I have personally never used the sinus buster but my doctor did prescibe me something called sinus dynamics. It has worked incredibly and it so easy to use. Good luck with your search.######Yeah, I use Sinus Buster. Once I got used to the burn, it has become a godsend. I use two squirts in each nostril in the morning, and one squirt every 4-6 hours after that. It basically creates an irrigation system out of your own mucuous, and the result is astounding. I 'm experiencing allergy relief for the first time in my life. My problems had more to do with rhinitis than sinusitis.######I HAVE ALSO TRIED THIS PRODUCT WHEN I CAME BACK FROM THE ENT YESTERDAY AND GOT NOTHING BUT A SCHEDULE FOR A CT SCAN A WEEK AWAY AND FOLLOW UP WITH HIM 2 WEEKS AWAY... I HAD RUN ACROSS THIS FORUM MENTIONING THIS SPRAY AND FIGURED I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY... KNOWING I COULD NOT WAIT A WEEK TILL I FOUND OUT IF I HAD A SINUS INFECTION, I HAD TO AT LEAST TRY IT... I FEEL LIKE I WILL BE HEADING TOWARD NASAL SURGERY FOR DEVIATED SEPTUM... HOWEVER, THIS SPRAY HAS CLEARED UP MY BIGGEST SPOT OF BLOCKAGE, UP NEAR WHERE THE DEVIATION IS... ALSO, IT ALLOWED ME TO BE IN THE AC WITHOUT GETTING IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED... I WANT TO CONTINUE THE PRODUCT TILL I CAN SORT OUT THE ISSUE OF SURGERY... HOWEVER, I AM JUST WONDERING IF THE CONTENTS OF THIS SPRAY WILL DO LONG TERM DAMAGE TO SENSITIVE TISSUE? HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS RESULT WITH SINUS BUSTER? AND WHAT ABOUT LONG TERM USE?######I just ordered some today so i 'll let you know what the results are when i try it.######Well i 've been using it for several days and thh results are mixed. It does seem to offer some relief when i use it but it 'd made no difference to the sinusitis overall; that still gets worse on a daily basis. For what it cost plus shipping i would n't buy it again but might try sinol instead if anything. I 'm waiting for something called a saltpipe at the moment which is supposed to be amazing for all sorts of respiratory conditions so i 'll see if that has any impact on my symptoms. Watch this space.######I 've had sinus problems since I was a kid do, mostly, to allergies. Over the years I 've tried a number of different products with the last being cortisone-based sprays. After a year or so even they stopped working. About 5 years ago I began using Sinus Buster. At first the `burn ' was pretty rough. After I got used to it I found the results were excellent. Best of all, the product continues to work. It has n't lost its effectiveness over the years. My only gripe is that the product no longer comes in the original spray bottle- only the metered dose.######How long does the metered dose last? The spray i got is nearly gone in two weeks and that 's not eve nusing it all the time. I would be spending Â# 35 a month for saome mild relief and it 's just not worth it. I wonder if the metered dose would last longer. Of course the causes and what works are different for most people and if i 'd have had better results i would n't be complaining. Anyway the saltpipe has helped with the fatigue and breathing but had no effect on the sinusitis so far but i 've only been using it two days. I felt the benefit straight away with the fatigue and my breathing is gradually improving. One thing worth mentioning is that you can use saltpipes nasally as well for sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. At the very least it 's going to clean my lungs out and counteract the effects of pollution where i live (apparently it 's the second worst in the uk) and for that alone it was worth it.######departed, I too experience fatigue, could you describe yours? and how do you use a saltpipe? where is it found? thanks... dr's say fatigue is not a symptom of sinus issues... which makes it even harder to get treatment here############Use Sinol Nasal Spray, available at Rite Aid. It also ultizes capsaicin but is much easier to use. Website is very impressive and have many doctors and clinical trials behind them. I have been using it for 16 months and I am a new woman, love it !!######Capsaicin is the same stuff that is used in Pepper Spray, carried by Police and Military.######Steer clear of this product !!! Honestly, it is one of the most painful experiences to spray this in your nose. IT SEVERLY BURNS YOUR NASAL CAVITY !!! . Any benefit it provides (which is little in my opinion) is FAR outweighed by the extreme pain. No joke, it 's pepper spray up your nose. Dumb idea for a product.######I have n't used this stuff in years. The first time I took it, it was one of the most painful 5 seconds in my life. But then I got used to it. I had headaches all the time and this only provided temporary relief and it was getting expensive to use it everyday. I went through two bottles very quickly. I went to a chiropractor and he discovered that my neck and back was out of alignment and causing my headaches. After some treatment from the chiropractor, I never had to use sinus buster again! I would n't recommend sinus buster as a permanent, long-term solution to your sinus/headache problems. I would only recommend it for the occasional sinus/headache sufferer. There are more practical solutions out there and you ca n't be dependent on sinus buster for the rest of your life.######Sinus Buster just issued results from a rigorous clinical study run at a leading medical research facility. It apparently worked incredibly well agaist congestion and sinus pain. And completely safe. No rebound. Do not accept any knock off capcaicin products with similar sounding names like the one mentioed above. It is definitely not the same !!!######Thanks to everyone. I jotted down all your suggestions. My ent will not give me anything else. He said there is nothing else out there. He has written me a prescription for everything possible. Pills, sprays, etc.. Nothing works. I get 2 allergy shots each week, allergy pillow cases, cleaned my ductwork, got new carpet, nettie pot, all OTC medicines, saline sprays. I sleep in an upright position. I am excited to have maybe have found a solution.######JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN AS A LONG SUFFERING SINUSITIS CASE. I TRIED SINUS BUSTER... PAINFUL AND REALLY NO HELP. I EAT CAPSICAIN, DRINK IT BUT NOT OF ANY BIG HELP. I SEE OTHER CAPSICAIN SINUS FORMULAS SUCH AS DR. SCHULZE'S BUT HAVE N'T TRIED. I 'M SCHEDULED FOR FESS SURGERY AND HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING SO SEVERE. WISH THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE. SO MANY OTHER PRODUCTS OUT THERE. I KEEP TRYING THEM AND RESEARCHING. GOOD LUCK######I have just started using the Sinus Buster which I bought at Rite Aid for about$ 15. I have had chronic sinusitis for about 25 years and had surgery which was of no benefit. I dont know about long range effects but the sinus buster has helped me tremendously already. I breathe easier with little sinus congestion. I was having a lot of bloody mucous and no more of that so far either. I plan to continue using this. I can tolerate the short burning sensation in my nasal passages when I first use it because it doesnt last long and is so worth it!######Sinus buster did not help me. I even bought casicain oil and made my own spray... ouch! But still no relief. good luck. I 'm scheduled for surgery... uuugh######I ca n't believe this would be a good thing to put in your nose! I have chronic sinusitis-- the drainage feels like a lump in my throast. Most of my life. No allergies. Two yrs ago I had surgery to remove a cyst filling most of the maxilarry sinus, causing blockage and infection because things could n't drain. (Though I always felt I had signs of irritating drainage). Things are better but I feel like the more I use the sinus rinse the more I NEED to use it! What 's that all about?

I have a chronic tension headache that is migraine like in some ways and some days (like today) i can feel really ill, generally i am weak and tired and light headed and a bit nauseous. My memory and concentration is poor and it all seems to be related to however bad the tension in my head is; as it gets worse so do the other symptoms. It can be overwhelming.

My problems started back when I was about 12? or so. That is when I had my first sinus infection. Since than I get terrible colds a few times a year and have problems breathing. Over the last year or so my suffering has increased, about 11 months ago I began to get a terrible sore throat on one side. Went to a doctor and she told me it was n't strep (got tested) and just a normal sore throat and to get rest. Anyway the sore throat lasted about 2 weeks and was almost unbearable. Than in June I started to get terrible headaches, and felt more stuffy than normal and another doctor told me I had chronic sinusitis, and that I had a sinus infection and told me to use a neti rinse and gave me 2 weeks worth of antibiotics. Than in August the sore throat came back on the same one side, terrible headaches on and off than the sore throat went away. Now starting a few days ago the sore throat has come back on the one side, along with terrible heads and a bit of ear pain all on the one side. Does anyone think this is another sinus infection? I feel like I 'm in and out of doctors constantly the past year. I went back to the doctor last month and was told I had a cold, but this time it feels different. Please tell me there 's something out there that will help me more and I hope this is just another infection. Thank you so much for your time######>> Hi you say you have a diviated septum which could be the cause of your problem! I understand they could fix the septum through surgery! What did your Dr say! Have you asked him before about the posibillity?######Hi, I also have a deviated septum and am often blocked up on one side or the other. I have had only one bad Sinus infection and was recomended (Sudafed) by an ENT specialist. He prescribed it in tabs form but some months later I found it in liquid form. I must say of all the things I have tried I found this to be the best. It goes without saying that if you have an infection you will require Antibiotics but for normal use this is good.

If they do not know what your problem is, they say you have fibromyalgia and you may have it or not. Some do have true fibromyalgia but with the diagnosis being used for a dumping ground we never know if we really have fibro or just have something else they have no clue about.

I went to the diabetes center yesterday to get a monitor and have them show me how to use it. I 'm supposed to check my blood sugar levels 4 times a day: before breakfast and 2 hours after each meal. When I went in, it was three hours after I had eaten, but we took it anyway and recorded it like it had been 2. It was 109. Now, the guidelines she gave me says I do n't want it to be above 120 at the 2-hours-after mark. So 109 is pretty significantly lower (i think), but I did n't think much about it because it had been an extra hour. I took it again two hours after dinner, and it was 92. This morning it was 70. I do n't know what the morning number is supposed to be, but that still seems low to me. My fasting number, which is pretty much the same thing, when I took the glucose test was 96, and the nurse commented on how ``great '' that was because it was so low. But 70? Maybe I do n't know anything, but those numbers seem really low to me. I do n't want to call and be freaking out or anything until I have a full day of testing under my belt, but I was wondering if anybody here knew anything about it. How low is too low? Should I be concerned?######I just took my three hour long glucose test yesterday and im worried that it will come back bad. Pretty sure it will. I dont know if I can freaking prick my fingers like that... Ahhhh makes me queasy thinking about it. The dr said it can get so worse as to inject insulin too ??? I hope you find out your answers = 0 \############I dont know a week ago I took the hour long test, they took my blood I drank the nasty sprite stuff. . Waited an hour and they took my blood the test came back bad so I had to do the same thing but for three hours and they took my blood 4 times, once before and once every hour into the test up till the fourth hour. They didnt do that with you?######Yes, they did. But what i 'm saying is that when they prick your finger, they know within seconds what your sugar levels are. They should n't be making you wait to get the results; they knew the results when you were sitting right there. It 's not like they have to send bloodwork to a lab or something. Heck, I knew before the last prick on my three-hour test that I had failed it because I was already high on two of the numbers.######Oh I havent pricked my finger yet I just took the four hour test yesterday and they said if any two of them come back high I have gestational diabities which im pretty sure they will. I used to have highinsulin a few years ago when I was overweight so thats why the dr wanted to do this test early. Also every single time I eat I get tired and when I stand everything goes black. Something tells me its all connected. I should find out in a few days how the test came out and when I do she said that I have to come in and learn about all that pricking and stuff, see a dietition and some kind of group thing.######Yes, they have pricked your finger. If you did the glucose tolerance test, that 's what they do... Besides, you said they pricked your finger. Each time they prick your finger during that test, they are checking to see if your blood sugar levels are within a certain range. If it 's too high, then that 's bad. They would have known when they did the test if your levels were too high, there is nothing to ``wait '' on. Anyway... Someone * please * answer my question ?????######They took a tube of blood each time from my arm, the never pricked my finder. Hope you get your answer######That 's weird. Anyway, good luck to you. I 'm sure everything will be ok either way.######When I had my 1hr they pricked my finger... But when I had my three hour they drew 4 tubes of blood. I still go my results the next day. Didnt' need to worry abut it. When I had fainting spells they checked my blood and told me that I needed to make sure I ate something like an apple and drink a clear soda... It always made me feel better right away. They gave me the moniter too and as long as it was above 60 I was ok. But now I don; t have the spells anymore and I do n't have to prick my finger anymore.############My grandmother is diabetic and its disgusting now I know pregnancy induced diabetes is different and does go away 95% if you take care of urself this is what I do know some of it is from hubby... Carbs are really bad (basically they are spoons of sugar but come out later) taters, anything bread, carrots pretzels, chip etc naturals sugars you eat in halves so have half an apple in the morning the other in the afternoon just as an example. Make sure ur meals are complete 1/4 of ur plate should have stuff from every food group besides that ur about average for blood sugar 109 is quite high and 70 is kinda playing it on the average-normal side. Best of luck lalee just as an fyi for anyone if you have gestational diabete and do not take care of urself/eat healthy/moderation/diet it is very possible your diabetes may carry over past the pregnancy so take care of urself now! Hubby said its really gross when people come in with diabetes, it slowly kills you and your skin dies he said the smell can be somewhat bad now majority of people who have it did do it to theselves for not taking care of themseles unfortunatly there is people who never asked for it!############I had to sign up in order to respond to this post. I am a certified diabetes educator. The information that diamondsz provided is not only dangerous, but can be construed as prejudice advice to all with diabetes. Everything that diamondz said is wrong. 1) having diabetes is ``not disgusting. '' people who think it is do not even know what diabetes means. 2) gestational diabetes usually goes away, but a person with gestational diabetes is at risk for developing it again in future pregnancies, or type 1 diabetes (we 'll get to that). 3) carbs are not bad at all. Everything you eat consists of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You can not avoid carbohydrates, and in fact, probably consume 60% of them. There are many, many kinds of carbohydrates. I would get into that, but it would take weeks of writing to tell you about it. 4) spoon fulls of sugar is bad, like she said, but it is bad for everyone. Being diabetic does n't mean it 's bad. If you ever, ever say, ``oh my god, that person is diabetic, they ca n't be eating that (insert desert item here)! '' , you need to stick your foot in your mouth. Especially if you ca n't even tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All of the ``meal plan '' advice that has been provided by diamondz are just platitudes. It is impossible to do an armchair diagnosis of a person. Use this boards as support, not as medical advice. The fyi by diamondz is even more misleading. She claims that if you do n't take care of yourself now, then you 'll have diabetes later in life. This is not true. (we 'll get to that, too.) her ``hubby '' is wrong about diabetes, and it 's shameful that he be claimed to be an authority in this field. It 's all wrong, wrong, and wrong. Yes, uncontrolled diabetes leads to complications. Please note... Uncontrolled. This means different things to different types of diabetes. I wish diamondz did n't spread the common ``media belief '' of diabetes on this board. The following information is true: there are two major classifications of diabetes; type 1, and type 2. Of all the cases of diabetes in the world, between 5-10% of people in the world have type 1 diabetes; the remainder have type 2 diabetes. Of all the people who have type 2 in the world, there are over 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes. Four of the 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes are caused by lack of exercise, poor diet, and insulin resistance. This can sometimes be blamed on the person for not exercising or eating poorly-- in fact, most of the time, it is based on food. But some forms of type 2 diabetes are not the fault of the person. Hence, diamondz calling it ``gross '' is totally abusive in her ``authority. '' some people who have type 2 have gotten it because of cancer drugs (chemotherapy). So the next time you call a type 2 diabetic ``gross '', you 'd better have your facts straight-- they could be a five-time cancer survivor, and you 've just hurt their feelings for living. Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by diet, exercise, and sometimes oral medications called insulin sensitizers or incretin mimetics. Now, to the important type of diabetes-- type 1. Type 1 diabetes does not occur based on anyone's choice. It hits randomly. I said randomly. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction. Do you know anyone with ms? Lupus? Celiac disease? These are all autoimmune conditions. Type 1 diabetes can hit anyone-- at any time. It 's commonly called ``juvenile diabetes '' because it frequently occurs in younger people, but it can happen at any age. For every one-hundred diabetics that reads this message, five to ten of them have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 means their pancreas does not produce insulin, so it must be supplied through an insulin injection. So long as the person tests their blood glucose frequently, and adjusts for carbohydrate/fat/protein intake at meals, they can ``think like a pancreas '' and keep glucose values in normal ranges. This is not an easy job-- it is a full time job. This is a very complex subject, so i 've only touched the surface. There are basal insulins, bolus insulins, and a very complex world of diabetes management. If a person does not manage their blood glucose levels, they are more prone to diseases that affect small blood vessels (like retinopathy, kidney problems, neuropathy, and the list goes on). Please-- do not look at kids with type 1 and say they 're doomed. If they are in control of their diabetes, they live just as long. And with modern technology (e.G. Home blood glucose testing), complications of diabetes are reduced. Type 2 diabetes complications are of the same manner. These are the target populations that give type 1 diabetes a bad, bad name-- diamondz comments are evidence of this. I will respond to lalee's question in the following message.######Lalee, now to answer your question. Gestational diabetes is an interesting topic to me. It 's believed that in some women, insulin resistance causes the diabetic symptoms (it can be seen like type 2 diabetes), where in other cases, it models type 1 diabetes (where the mother's beta cells stop producing insulin in sufficient quantities). Home blood glucose meter kits have a +/ -20% error. This means that if you see 100mg/dl on the screen, it could be anywhere between 80 and 120 mg/dl. The purpose of the meter is tell a story of your trends. If you were showing 200 mg/dl on many occassions, this trend would be a flag about a problem. Showing 121 mg/dl does not mean you have diabetes... Even showing 140 mg/dl does not prove anything, because of the margin of error on the test kits. This fact should help to relax you a bit. Each of those tests costs$ 1.00, so it 's hard to experiment with the meter without costing a fortune. The average blood glucose level of humans, according to quest diagnostics statistics, is 85 mg/dl. This is a plasma level. This means that including post-meal, pre-meal, and fasting conditions, a person without diabetes averages, in their lifetime, 85 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose levels fall below 60 mg/dl. Some people may experience it, and simply eating a meal (or candy) can raise blood glucose back up. You might feel shakey, confused, tired, annoyed, scared, and even sweaty during hypoglycemia. This is because stress hormones turn on in the body in an attempt to raise blood glucose-- this hormone is called glucagon. When a type 1 diabetic takes too much insulin, or does too much exercise, their blood glucose can drop-- hence their need to chomp on fast acting carbohydrates (such as dextrose). Hyperglycemia is defined as the condtion when glucose is higher than 180 mg/dl. If you give even the healthiest person in the world a bunch of candy, they will rise above 120 mg/dl. The person training you probably was reading the brochure and standard training literature. And they probably do n't know that a meter has a +/ -20% error rate. (i actually see the one-touch ultra, and if you read the small print documentation, you 'll see this is the fact). Make sure your meter code is set for the test strips you 're using-- this can skew your results a bit when it does n't match the test strip vial. 70 mg/dl is normal for waking up. The values you have presented show no signs of hyperglycemia (diabetes). If you are ever worried about having low blood glucose, just eat. Typically, you will find yourself at a low glucose level in the mornings, since you have n't eaten much. If you get up and wait 30 minutes before testing, you 'll discover that your body (specifically, your liver) releases glucose to raise you in order to help you ``hunt for food. '' you have nothing to be concerned about. I 'm going to give one more lesson for any other readers out there. Why are we concerned with gestational diabetes? Well, here's why. Insulin is a hormone that turns glucose (sugar) into fat. That 's it. Yes, very simple. People who lack insulin can not turn glucose into fat, so their bodies ``starve to death ''-- people with type 1 diabetes before 1921 (the invention year of insulin) would die, despite whatever they ate. Type 2 diabetes is defined as insulin resistance-- meaing that their body has plenty of insulin, but for some reason, is not able to use it (i could speak for hours on this topic.) you have beta cells in your pancreas that release insulin in response to high glucose values. (this is why a type 1 takes insulin when they eat, or when they need to lower their hyperglycemia into normal glycemia, which is in the range of 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl). I 'm leaving out a lot of details here... But basically, here 's the problem. If your blood glucose goes really high, the baby will produce insulin in order to lower the blood glucose in its body. You see, you share what is in your body with the baby's body. If your blood glucose is high, the baby's blood glucose will be high, too. So what does the baby do? The baby's pancreas produces insulin to compensate. This insulin, though, does not travel out to the mother's body. Instead, it works to lower glucose in the baby. Read back to what I said that insulin does. It builds fat. Here's why gestational diabetes is a bad thing: 1) the baby will come out weighing 10 + pounds... Not exactly a thing you want going through you, right? 2) high blood glucose increases the chance of bacteria to set up shop, because glucose is the essential food for all life, including bacteria; 3) having high glucose in the mom can cause oxidative stress, meaning, the mom will feel yucky; 4) having high glucose in mom can result in mom's beta cells working too hard-- if they work too hard, they will become damaged, and the mom could potentially be left with type 1 diabetes, which can occur anywhere from one day after birth to... You guessted it... A risk lasting the rest of her life. Some women have 3 kids, and end up with type 1 diabetes. Sorry for all the lessons, but I really saw a lot of information that was way out of line in this thread. Diabetes should not and does not have a negative image associated with it, as diamondz was presenting. You should never define a person with diabetes as beign a ``diabetic '' in a social situation; would you call a person with cancer something like a ``that peson with cancer '' or a person confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis (ms) a ``multiple schleratic ''? I do n't think so. If you or anyone else has questions about diabetes, please feel free to contact me. Typos are the mistake of me writing this at 2 am. I hope this helps to lower your concerns. Also, I could go into the whole world of the glucose tollerance tests (gtt) that some of you have experienced, but I think this is more than enough information to digest for now. Btw, there are people who have ``hypoglycemia ''-- where they produce too much insulin, or become hypoglycemia after eating a high carbohydrate meal. (their body responds with insulin for the meal, but the insulin hangs around too long, causing cells to turn too much of that glucose into fat). Did you know that an average person has 6 grams of glucose in their blood? That 's why diabetes is so hard to manage... If you just add one extra gram of sugar in the body, it can raise glucose values by 40 mg/dl or even more (depending on weight). Okay, i 've said enough on this. I really hope diamondz takes back what she 's said about diabetes, and that she needs to have her husband, if he 's in the medical establishment, to stop telling her what he 's ``heard. '' by the way, a person's glucose can change by 300 mg/dlin as little as one hour. So do n't sweat the small changes. If you 're between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl while fasting, you 're doing great. Two hour post-meal (also called post-prandial) should be under 120 mg/dl, though some scientists believe 140 mg/dl is just as fine, so long as fasting levels return to below 100 mg/dl. These values are played with all the time, but since your home test kit is only correct within 40% of the actual value (+20% to -20%), you ca n't freak out. Now if you keep getting results that are high, or after eating, then you can be concerned a bit more. If you have more diabetes questions, I highly recommend going to the american diabetes association website (www.Diabetes.Org) and go to the message board, and post questions in the appropriate forum. You will have very well grounded and experienced people there that can assist you with your questions.######Weird, my capitalizations on certain words has been modified... For example, quest diagnostics is the name of a business, and should be with a capital ``q '' and a capital ``d '', but when I saved the message, it was placed in lower-case format. Needless to say, the above messages I posted are not how I wrote them. This forum must modify cases to their own non-english standard. -- oh, and one more thing... Labs do n't necessarily test with a glucose meter. For the person who had blood drawn into a tube at each hour, this is because they are sending the blood in for accurate tests. Their glucose meters are the same as the ones you can buy off the shelf. That means they still have that +/ -20% error. The blood they put in a tube, however, will be sent to a lab, spun on a centrafuge, and testsed. The margin of error for lab-tested blood is typically less than 2% (that means a 4 mg/dl error range), which is much, much, much, much more accurate than a home glucose meter.######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy

Diabetes is a disease wherein the body fails to manufacture or properly use insulin.Insulin is an agent of the blood sugars that is used as a source of energy throughout the body.Although the liver uses insulin for the storage of glycogen, a processed form of glucose. In a person with Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin that is produced does not work properly, and the sugars are not able to get into some of the cells.######There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is sometimes called insulin-dependent, immune-mediated or juvenile-onset diabetes. It is caused by an auto-immune reaction where the bodyâ$ s defence system attacks the insulin-producing cells. The reason why this occurs is not fully understood. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually occurs in children or young adults. People with this form of diabetes need injections of insulin every day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood. If people with type 1 diabetes do not have access to insulin, they die. Type 2 diabetes is sometimes called non-insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes do not usually require injections of insulin. Usually, they can control the glucose in their blood by watching their diet, taking regular exercise, oral medication, and possibly insulin. Type 2 diabetes is most common in people older than 45 who are overweight. However, as a consequence of increased obesity among the young, it is becoming more common in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes. If people with type 2 diabetes are not diagnosed and treated, they can develop serious complications, which can result in an early death. Worldwide, many millions of people have type 2 diabetes without even knowing it. Others do not have access to adequate medical care. The onset of type 2 diabetes is also linked to genetic factors but obesity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet increase the risks. Some women develop a third, usually temporary, type of diabetes called â$ gestational diabetesâ$ when they are pregnant. Gestational diabetes develops in 2-5% of all pregnancies, but usually disappears when the pregnancy is over. Women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on.

Every morning I get up and take insulin, I take more before I go to bed at night. Yesterday my sugar levels kept bottoming out all day long. I was steadily having to drink juice, cokes, and other drinks with sugar, and I was having to eat constantly. After dinner, my blood sugar read 183. I was scared to take insulin before bedtime because of the events in the previous day, so I didnt. I woke up and my b.s. was 89. I still have n't taken any insulin and my sugar now reads 75. I have no idea what is going on with my body. I have n't taken insulin in over 24 hours, but my blood sugar remains normal. Could anyone help, please?######You have an interesting situation. If you had described this situation maybe 20 years ago. My response would have been that you likely had antibodies in your blood stream that were binding insulin and releasing it at unpredictable times. This was a common situation when animal-derived insulins were used. It is quite rare nowadays with recombinant human insulin to see this situation. Situations that could explain your situation besides insulin binding antibodies would include delayed emptying of food from the stomach, celiac disease, addison's disease, or perhaps a new oral medication that you did not mention in your history. Nevertheless, I am concerned that you are at risk for DKA as a type 1 diabetic without any type of insulin coverage. I strongly recommend speaking with your diabetes doctor or your doctor's CDE about your symptoms.######You 're lucky. I wish I had hypoglycemia instead of type one diabetes. the only times I do n't have to take insulin with food is after exercise. Sometimes miracles happen. Maybe your prayers have been answered..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

Thanks######If your brother has Type 1 diabetes, the only treatment is to use insulin, either with syringes (shots) or through an insulin pump. There currently is no permanent cure except a pancreas transplant, and they usually do n't do those unless the kidneys are also failing. If your brother has Type 2 diabetes, then it would be treated initially with diet, exercise and possibly oral medication. If he 's overweight and loses most of the excess weight, he then might not need any medication at all. But if he IS Type 2, it 's important that he not delay in treating it, as the blood sugar must be stabilized as soon as possible while he is attempting to lose the excess weight. I 'm assuming that it 's more likely that he 's a Type 1. A regimen of a shot of long-acting insulin taken once a day, coupled with rapid-acting insulin taken before eating and geared to the amount of carbs he will be eating, is the best way to control Type 1.

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes.######What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes.

The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Points to Remember What is diabetes? a disorder of metabolism-- the way the body digests food for energy and growth What are the main types of diabetes? type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes gestational diabetes What is the impact of diabetes? affects 17 million people is a leading cause of death and disability costs$ 132 billion per year Who gets diabetes? people of any age people with a family history of diabetes most common in older people, overweight and sedentary people, African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Where Is More Information Available?

Ever since my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer a few years ago I 've been incredibly careful with my diet. I 'm thin, I exercise religiously and I eat very few carbs. I do n't eat pasta, rice, candy, refined sugar of any kind and I do n't drink soda or alcohol. The only bread I eat is a single slice of sprouted grain bread in the morning. Other than that it 's veggies, lean proteins, nuts, dairy and the occassional piece of fruit. I promise you- I 'm not exagerrating. So as I said, I was surprised when my blood sugar came back high on the test. I bought a monitor and test strips and started testing my blood sugar levels and what 's weird is I find that when I do n't eat for a few hours (especially if I work out really vigorously) I feel shaky and anxious- but I test my blood and the sugar levels are high. I 'm so confused. After I eat, they go back down a bit. My fasting levels are in the normal range... I 'm concerned because I had an uncle who had Type 1 diabetes that was n't diagnosed til he was almost 50... I 'd really appreciate any insights. Thank you so much.######First off, what do you mean by ``high ''? Different folks have different standards. If it is actually high, then it could be your liver dumping glucose in response to your body's requirement for energy. It 's not that selective though and tends to over do it.######Hi Cdmom, I would ask my doctor to give me an A1c test. That will let you and your doctor know what your average blood sugars have been running for the past three months. You need to find out if you are a diabetic.######I agree with Cora that your liver could be dumping glucose because of a need for it due to exercise (perhaps). Your comments about your weight (not heavy) and what you eat (or do n't eat) can only suggest to us that you are probably not developing type 2 diabetes. My own familiarity is with type 1 diabetes, not type 2. My son has type 1 and celiac disease and I can tell you sometimes his blood sugar rises without food: that just means he needs at that moment a higher dose of the basal insulin (he takes Levemir for that). I 'm wondering what happens when you eat a high carb food (if you ever do). Since you have BG testing equipment at home, you could actually give yourself a glucose challenge. The procedure is to test in the morning on an empty stomach, then drink two cans of soda (or juice with equivalent carb content), then test an hour and two hours later (or more if you like). Two hours later I believe you are expected to be below some number (I think it is 140 but maybe others here can confirm that). We have never done the glucose test at home, but an endo at one point told me how one does it, and commented it is easily done at home if you have the meter for measuring blood sugar. I 'm a little concerned you could be developing type 1 (although I am not a doctor so do n't get too upset by just me suggesting it). If you ate a high carb diet one would expect the main issue to be your body's inability to deal with consumed sugars (or carbs). If you are really eating such a very low carb diet as it seems you might be, then perhaps your body is struggling to produce the maintenance dose of insulin needed (which normally does not happen with t1d until a little later I think). My son for example, for some months after his t1d still produced enough insulin that he needed no basal dose, just doses for meals (but his meals were typical meals with some carb content). Our bodies do need a little insulin all the time, not just to deal with the food we eat. Still it seems a little far fetched that you could be short on this low level of needed basal insulin (by your body not producing enough), and I think the liver dumping sugar explanation might make more sense. In any case, you could do your own home glucose challenge and find out the answer if you wanted, or you could go to an endo who specializes in diabetes (hopefully not just type 2) and you could also get an answer there. Good luck.######Thank you so much!######Thanks for your suggestion. My insurance covers basically nothing so I 've been hesitant to ask for more testing, but I think you 're right- I need to find out for sure if I 'm diabetic. I really appreciate how quickly the kind folks on this board reply!######Thank you so much- I will definitely try that. It 's interesting you mentioned celiac disease: my family history has several autoimmune diseases in it, celiac disease being one of them. I hope your son is well. My sister's son has celiac and it 's meant an enormous amount of adjustment and learning. I 'm always amazed by the power of mothers to basically give themselves medical educations on behalf of their kids. Thanks again.######Hi! Perhaps you have a stress syndrome expressing glycemic surges from stress hormone elevations, e.g. ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine, responsive to the situation concerning your husband. Have you had the the appropriate blood chemistry profiles to determine whether that might be the case? If were found to be the case, or if it were suspected, on competent examination, perhaps you 'd consider therapy, talk or chemical. Best of luck. CT######Wow- thank you so much. I had n't considered that. I think I 'm going to have to ask for more info & testing from the doctor. Best to you, cdmom.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Your body is trying to get rid of the sugar so you are thirsty & have to go to the bathroom... there are many other symptoms but many times when blood glucose levels first begin to rise higher than normal, you dont have extreme symptoms and it can be overlooked for years! 2hrs after meals is usually the first place high blood sugars are seen. Although they say Type I diabetes (those that require insulin because their body doenst make any) does not have a ``genetic '' link many think it does. Type II diabetes (insulin resistance & lack of insulin response which can result in needing outside insulin) is hereditary. Its not that you can get it by eating too much sugar per se... But here 's the situation... you eat too much sugar and you gain weight-you have extra fat in your body. The fat INTERFERES with the insulin you produce... hence your pancreas produces extra insulin and usually down the road cant keep up... the best way to prevent diabetes is keep extra weight OFF and do some type of exercise. Keep in mind, diabetes is having high blood sugar. Lower your blood sugar by loosing weight, making smart food choices most of the time, and exercising and you cant go wrong.######Easier said than done sometimes... but I ``m trying !! I 'm a newly diagnosed diabetic. I 'm trying my best to eat the right things and trying to lose weight.######I have type 11 Diabetes & I did n't have any family that has it. Mine was n't caught earily, so I have Neuropathy. That is nerve damage. i have numbness in my feet and without treatment I jerk bad. I take medicine for it and it helps. It is had to stay on a diet, but it is best. I did drink a lot & still do. The doctors office can take a sample of you blood and see if you have it, Just do n't eat for a couple hrs. Nope this helps. Good Luck Fancylady.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

He had had a few episoded of vomiting and the ER verified him to be ketotic at the time with elevated blood sugar. He had a spontaneous resolution of the crazy labs and was released. He has some bedwetting episodes as well. Take a look at the labs below and let me know what you think. They said he is extremely borderline but gave no care routine for us at home.######hi You need to find out whether they think his blood sugars are high due to diet related intake. This will to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes if they suspect it. Also is he having any follow up tests done?######It looks like he has diabetes to me, though he may be in the honeymoon phase. His age and the positive GAD 65 indicates it 's type 1.######I know they suspected Type 1 and he went for a trial and they checked his autoantibodies (?) and found nothing, but still have no explanation for the labs. They want to follow up once a year. Can someone give me more info on the ``honeymoon phase ''. Thanks so much for all your help, any info is appreciated. I have read so much lately that I am spinning in circles!######In a person who has type 1 diabetes, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by immune cells. However, during the period immediately following diagnosis, most people go through a ``honeymoon phase '' in which their existing beta cells still function, producing some insulin so maybe that may be why the doctors do n't want to offer any medication yet.######Hey... just wanted to add my 2 cents, I went into the hospital when I was 12 with the same symptoms. My BG was 160 mg/dl (high, but not diabeties high). THey shrugged it off and sent me home... when I turned 15, I got full on type 1, was omiting non stop, drinking massive amounts of water, peeing every 5 minutes, and I looked like Skeletor from He-man... I was in the hospital with a glucose reading of 930 mg/dl... so it took about 3 years for me to fully get the disease and who KNOWS how long I 'd had slightly elevated BG's even before the age of 12. I hit a honey-moon phase shortly after admittance at 15, and it took another 3 years for that phase to completely end (I hated the honeymoon period because I NEVER know when my pancreas was ging to kick in or not along with my external insulin injections... i.e.. . lotsa lows and highs!) If I had 1 suggestion for you, at this stage, I 'd say, measure your sons BG levels using a blood glucose meter you can buy at any Rite-Aid or drugstore in the mornings and at night before bed. If his Bg's are over 130 consistently, keep monitoring them a lot. If you start seeing BG's up over 150 consistently... it 's doctor prescribed injection based insulin time (do n't worry... it 's not that scary... the needles they use are TINY). Trust me, having type 1 diabetes these days, if caught early enough is a CINCH if you 're responsible with it. The last thing you want though, is to have him running unkown high BG's in the 250-350 range for years before he finally gets sick enough to pay a visit to the ER. (like my case)... because long-term elevated BG's can cause nerve, eye, kidney and liver damage. My final suggestion is this... if he does end up becomming full-blown type 1... read ``The Diabetes Solution '' by Bernstien. It 's an amazing, revolutionary approach to the disease for type 1 (NOT type 2's) that shows how a person with type 1 can eat and live and have to take VERY minute amounts of insulin. His method allows type 1's to live with EXCLLENT post-meal blood sugars that, like normal non-diabetics... never go above 160 mg/dl (an almost impossibel feat for type 1's... and the primary reason type 1's end up with long-term complications). The fractional insulin amounts he prescribes with his diet also make living with the disease REALLY safe and foolproof... no dangerous lows, no extrmeme highs... and very little dependence on medication. If you started him on this young (after his honey moon period) he could easily live to be 105! Hope this helps. . though I know I got pretty far ahead of your situation. These are just things I wish MY parents had known 13 years ago..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes
659	59	5cc38c1ec061d64ea4994c8d	http://www.healthboards.com/boards/diabetes/585743-does-my-hubby-have-diabetes-please-help.html	0	Does my hubby have diabetes? Please help!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes######For the past few months my hubby has not been himself. He is tired all the time, and since mid December has been constantly thirsty. He ca n't get enough to drink. Several trips throughout the day to the bathroom, (but would n't that be from all the liquids he drinks?) His vision goes blurry, he gets very shakey, and sometimes he says he feels like he is going to pass out. No energy. While shopping last night I picked up a blood glucose test meter. We waited until this morning to do the test. He did n't have anything to eat or drink for 9 hours so we could get the proper results. The meter came up with ``510 ''. The test said if it is below 20 or higher then 600 a warning would appear letting him know it was too low or too high. We do n't know what a normal level should be. The test does n't really tell us. We did the test again about an hour after he ate lunch and it was ``471 ''. I did the test also to see what would happen and mine said ``80 '' in the morning and ``105 '' after lunch. He is 54 years old and NEVER been to a family Dr. because of not having any health insurance.Today I called all over to find a Dr. that will accept new patients without insurance. After 3 hrs. I found one who made an appt. but not until March 25. I even explained how worried I am about him. No one seemed to care. If he would of had insurance, they would have glady seen him. Can someone please tell us what a normal reading should be and your opinions on his symptoms? Thank you!######I do n't mean to scare you. But I would STRONGLY suggest you take your husband to a hospital emmergency room IMMEDIATELY. A lot of his other blood chemistries could also be out of whack and life threatening. It is possible that he may just get sent home with a prescription for glyburide, but please, you are better safe than sorry. These numbers are life threatening from what I understand. Please do not wait for the dr's appt. Go to the hospital. His numbers are extremely high. Anything above 126 is abnormal and these are life threatening values, again, from what I understand.######Normal is more in the range you saw on yourself, a bit higher would also be normal. In terms of symptoms, frequent urination is a symptom. I am not a Dr but my understanding is that where your blood sugar is too high, your kidneys try to dump some of the sugar out through urine. So you pee a lot. This dehydrates you and you are thirsty. I do n't know if you measured properly but if so, 510 and 471 would be very high. Can you continue looking for another doctor sooner? Is there not another medical service you can get help with?######I agree with Uma... your husband should go to the nearest emergency room. With blood sugars running that high, he could be in diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. While there, ask if he would qualify for uncompensated care (most hospitals have a fund to help take care of people who do n't have health insurance and are in financial straits but still need urgent medical care.) A non-diabetic's blood sugars would never go that high, even after eating a high-carb meal. Normal range is between 70 and 140, never higher. Your husband is definitely diabetic... question is, whether it 's type 1 or type 2, and the only way to tell is through some blood tests. Ruth######Yes, that would indicate diabetes, probably type 2, given his age, meaning he has resistance to his own insulin. He needs to see a doctor or go to the hospital asap to get his blood glucose in control. Normal blood glucose is between 70 and 120, so 520 is very high. Meters read ``HI '' when over 600, but that warning is just indicating extremely severe highs. Good luck, and do not let this slide so as to prevent any complications.######Finally talked hubby into going to the ER instead of waiting for Dr. appt. He does have type 2 diabetes. He did n't have any ketones which they said was a good thing. His glucose level while we were there was 296. They gave him a prescription for Metaformin. They set him up with a follow-up Dr. for this Thursday. I just want to thank e `one for telling me he should go to the ER. I was really scared for him. He 's been on the med. for 2 days but his numbers are still in the 200's. Anyone have any idea how long this med. takes to start working? Thank you all again!######Everyone is different but met can take weeks to kick in full effect. If I remember well they said as much as 4 to 6 weeks. When I started it was n't doing anything and I read it COULD take several weeks. It will slowly start to make a difference. Was it his morning levels that were so bad or after eating? In the mean time, go easy on the carbs and drink lots of water.######Not really sure if he is overweight, but probably is. . He is 6 ' 1 '' and weighs 255 pounds He 's gained 25 pounds since Sept' 07. Thats when he quit smoking (cold turkey) and took up eating candy. . tons of it! Around Nov./ Dec. is when he started feeling really bad. . (But since not feeling well he 's been losing weight) The ER did n't give us a diet plan or anything to follow before his Dr. appt. on Thursday, so I had to go online and look it up. I know the med. is making him even more sicker to his stomach, cramps, and diarrhea. I guess thats a normal side effect from what I have read about it and just to stick with it because you will feel worse before you get better ??? His reading this morning before breakfast was 189, the lowest it 's been since we started monitoring it a few days ago. Exercise. . yes, my hubby wants the both of us to start going for walks. We will ask the Dr. about it first. He 's a bricklayer and ca n't wait for spring to settle in so he can return to work. But mostly, all he keeps saying is. . ``I hope I get better ''. He 's very worried about not having insurance and not being able to work if he does n't get feeling better. Hopefully things will work out somehow.######If he is in fact Type2, the metformin will start having an effect after about 3 weeks. But if he is Type1, metformin wo n't do him any good and he will steadily get worse. The fact that the onset has been so quick, blood sugars of 500 + have been recorded, and he has lost weight suggest that it could be Type1. So watch it carefully.######He was diagnosed with type 2.######Sheila, From what I have heard and read, the side effects from metformin do go away after a while, but if they become intolerable, the best way to manage is to start from the beginning, with a very small dose, and then increase it gradually over a period of several weeks. Do n't know how much he 's taking, so ca n't tell if he 's on a large dose already or not. This is something you can work out with his doctor. Ruth######Thank you Ruth. He is on 500mg, 3 times a day.######There are people who 's pancreas produces no insulin. They are type 1. There are people who produce insulin but their body does n't use it well. They are type 2. And there are people in between who do n't produce quite enough or who 's body barely make due with what they produce. There are people borderline between the two. The progression of one to another sometimes occurs with age Doctors will try and use metformin and if your husband does n't get good control, they will try other medications and may eventually prescribe the use of insulin. Metformin is usually the first attempt. If it does n't work, there are several other weapons in the arsenal. I guess theoretically the minute you use insulin you are type 1. NIDDM is ``non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus '' (type2). IDDM is ``insulin depenant diabetes mellitus '' (type 1). I does n't really matter if he is type 1 or 2. The important thing is for him to get control, and if to do so, means insulin injections, so be it. They are not the end of the world, just think of them as a different form of medication. But for now, listen to the Dr. Metformin does a couple of things. I allows the insulin your husband has (assuming he is producing some) more efficiently. It also reduces the amount of sugar his liver produces. If he is responding to metformin, the chances are he does have some insulin production left. If it 's enough is to be determined. But remember, if not, insulin injections are not the end of the world. I hope this info helps. If it 's just annoying, let me know######I feel the need to correct a misconception here. Type1 Diabetes and Type2 Diabetes are clinically diseases and need to be treated in different ways. Type1 is an autoimmune disorder, whereas Type2 is the result of insulin resistance. While you ca n't progress from the one to the other, it is possible to have both Type1 and Type2 at the same time. The problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between them in the early stages, and Type 1 is often mis-diagnosed as Type 2. If the diagnosis was not based on insulin level and antibody test results, it could be wrong. As I mentioned in the previous post, normal weight, weight loss and very high blood glucose readings suggest that this could be the case. The fact there were no ketones could just mean that the pancreas is still producing enough insulin to stop this from happening. But things change fast in the onset of T1. And treating Type1 with type2 oral medications accelerates onset of the disease. Most importantly, these medications wo n't stop the development of ketoacidosis, which is dangerous condition. This is why it needs to be watched carefully at this stage.######Could n't have said it better myself, Mark! Also, even if T2 progresses to the point where one is insulin-dependent (as I am), it is STILL T2, not T1. It 's just T2 with a completely worn-out pancreas. Ruth######Unfortunately not all doctors and litterature use the terms the way you do. Some refer to type 1 as insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 as non insulin dependent (NIDDM). They seem to classify the result, i.e ``do I need insulin ''. You have classified them, as some doctors and litterature by the underlying issue, ie deterioration of the beta cells in the pancreas vs deterioration of the bodies ability to use insulin, that may lean to a burn out of insulin production. In your language, is IDDM type 1 and NIDDM type 2 or are those terms meaningless?######No, Type1 is not equal to IDDM and Type2 is not equal to NIDDM. And yes, it is unfortunate that the terminology has become so confusing. I think it highlights the shortcomings of defining a disease by its symptomatic characteristics. It makes much more sense to define a disease in terms of what causes it. But up until the 1970's, the distinction between the respective causes of what we now know as Type1 and Type2 diabetes were not well understood. So it was easier to call them IDDM and NIDDM. The terms Juvenile Onset Diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes were used for similar reasons. Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years. It is not uncommon for young people to become insulin resistant and for older people to have an autoimmune attack on their beta cells. It is also common for someone with insulin resistance to lose all beta cell function and become totally dependent on injected insulin (like Ruth). Also consider that an insulin dependent T2 is not the same as a T1 (who is also insulin dependent). The presence of insulin resistance means that additional treatment options may have to be considered. The net effect is that those old terms have lost their descriptive exclusivity. This is why usage of the IDDM/NIDDM and Juvenile/Maturity Onset Diabetes terminology has been superseded by ``Type1 '' and ``Type2 '' diabetes. These terms are both well understood in terms of the respective etiology, and the risk of mis-diagnosis has been brought into focus. This is what I was commenting on in the earlier post. It is easy to misdiagnose a T1 as T2 in the early stages. Doctors still use age and size as diagnostic guidelines and do n't do the required tests. Use of the old terms, IMO, is not helpful and just causes a lot of confusion. Mark######To highlight the lack of clarity, this from the definition page of the canadian diabetes association. (url) http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/dictionary.asp[/url] TYPE 1 DIABETES (or insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas no longer produces any or very little insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar as an energy source. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and affects 10% of people with diabetes. TYPE 2 DIABETES (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs or the insulin is not metabolized effectively. Type 2 usually occurs later in life and affects 90% of people with diabetes..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I did really well. The numbness and pain is completely gone. I still have a twinge or two from wrist incision, but I am confident that will eventually leave. Today I had the surgery done on my L hand. The doctor did something different this time. When I awoke from the anethesia, I noticed my hand was numb. Before I left the hospital he came in to see me and I asked him about the numbness. He said that he used a pain block, and that my hand would be numb for a couple of days because of this. I didnot have this with my R hand surgery and I did fine, other than normal pain from surgery. Can anyone relate to this? Appreciate any answers! Thanks!######Hi Melani: Thanks for your reply and thanks for asking how I am doing? Praise the Lord, I am much better today. The numbness from the pain block left at about 1:00 a.m. this morning and I have only taken 1 pain tab today. I 'm glad that you got to see your doctor yesterday. I pray that you will get to feeling better soon.Do you have CTS in both hands and are you planning on doing the other hand? Please keep in touch and let me know how you are doing. Take care now.

Dr said to wear the wrist splints at night, so the first night was too bad... felt a bit stiff but never woke up with any numbness. Tried again last night and within about 45 min to an hour my right hand ached so much I had to take the splint off. It was so bad I needed to put a frozen magic bag on it just to sleep. It 's still aching now in the morning, not like last night but a mild sort of ache... is this normal? Are the splints supposed to give relief right away or do they take some getting used too? Should I call the dr back or keep trying for a few nights?######Did you have the splints fitted to your hand, or did you just buy some off the shelf? It sounds like they may be too tight if they are causing you pain. You should feel relief if they fit properly.######They are off the shelf but they are not tight, it seems to be from having my wrists straight?######So frustrated. If I wear the wrist guards I get no numbness but my hands get cramped from being straight. If I dont wear them I wake up with numb tingly hands. And this is just at night. My hands go numb on and off all day. I find it frustrating, my husband has the same thing caused from his job, but does n't get it all the time, he is having surgery because it affects his job. But I am not because I do n't have a job that is affected ??? I am wondering if I should see a chiropractor? Anyone know what else can help?

It was a difficult diagnosis because I had a negative Tingel's and Phalen's Sign, and never had the tell-tale signs of CTS of numbness-- just a constant dull ache in my hand and forearm, wich occaisional tingling. I was referred to a neurologist who conducted a nerve conduction study as well as an EMG and both showed that I had severe compression in both wrists. I was referred to a very reputable hand surgeon who performed open carpal tunnel release 13 weeks ago today. Initially, I had complete relief from my symptoms for about 6 weeks, but then the base of my hands grew very sensitive, and my hands and fingers are constantly aching. It will get better with rest but can be aggravated very easily (I 'm a very active 38yo male so it 's hard for me to just let the hands rest for such a long period). I was hoping that at three months after the surgery I would be feeling much better, but I 'm beginning to feel like the surgery was a failure. Has anyone else has a simliar experience after the surgery? How long can I expect the recovery to take?######I had my right done 3/23/11 and left 4/20/11. I still have some numbness and cramping so I 'm seeing my hand surgeon again next week and doing scar massage twice a day.######Boy do I wish I could help. I am in the same situation. After about three months, my wrist began to feel tight, like a rubber band. And presently it can get worse with the least little bit of work. I opened up five envelopes the other day, just to have my wrist full of pain and my fingers burning. I have to wonder if the carpal tunnel grows together with scar tissue, making it even smaller than it was originally. And then what? The surgeons do n't seem to care. If you find out anything, please let me know too. Thanks, csp1.######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

The carpal tunnel area has been doing well. The scar area is sore- Scar has healed, and then the skin peeled away.When I lean on it (like when using the mouse) it gets really sore). Also getting some other random pains. There is some other minor swelling right above the incision. It is stiff in the morning when I wake up. I see the doctor again on the 30th. Does this sound about where I should be? The elbow is a different story- it is sore, the scar puffs up when I do to much, he said no lifting over 10 pounds and I am trying to be careful, but it is hard.######Hi Maggietaz, I had carpal endoscopic release done on the 7th march and yes what you are describing has been the same for me. The stiff hand has ceased for me now when I wake up in the morning, but the hardness in the pain still remains but gets better with massage. Up until a week ago the over using etc causes pain you still have to be careful for some time after the release my surgeon says up to 12 months it can take some people I week ago I also hand ulna shortening done on the same arm so carpal tunnel release controlled by split. Are you having therapy still for your hand? As they say that makes a better recovery.######Hi Burt Thanks for the response. Have now been going to hand therapy and that is helping some, but was out of town all last week and the scar built up some tissue around it and got sort of hard, so she had to loose that up today, the whole hand was really sore, but it wa a really long week! How is your arm doing?######I had carpal tunnel release a few years ago and what you are describing seems perfectly normal. The scar tissue area will be tender for quite sometime. I do n't have any idea on the elbow thing though, sorry. Its been almost 5 years since mine and although I do n't have the pain in the middle of the night or the numbness anymore, my wrists still tend to get sore for over use and I find that they are not as strong as they once were. I hope that this is not the same for you once you are fully recovered. I did n't have any therapy afterwards either though. Best of luck to you! < 3######Hi Maggietaz, it has now been three weeks from having ulna shortening and wearing a splint and finding my hand were carpal release was done has got harder and because I can not move my wrist I think it is making it worse. But I know this will get better once the splint comes off in 4 to 6 weeks. When I am just sitting at night I take my splint off and use my heat bag which helps ease the hand. How is your elbow area healing? Did they cut through your palm or just on the wrist? Mine was just on the wrist. I have just had the Emg test conducted on my left wrist for carpal tunnel and also for ulna impact syndrome and find out next week if I get both surgery's done hoping only one. So looking forward to getting back to normal with my arms and start doing the things I enjoy in life. Kind regards BurtG######You do n't want to get scar tissue. I did n't know how much time to go in between having both of my hands done and so decided on 3 months back in 2005. By 2009 I needed to have my right hand done again. I had full blown CTS with numbness and pain. This time I was more careful, had a better surgeon and massaged the area not long after surgery and (knock on wood) so much better. One thing my PT told me that really helps with some everyday things- wear weight lifting gloves. I do this when I drive. IT may help when you use the mouse. It cushions the area so it does n't put pressure on it. Or put a rolled up towel under your hand when you use the mouse.######I have been sending the PT person twice a week. The scar tissue was bad last week as I had been out of town for a week, but after two visits this week it is much better. I just had the small incision by my wrist. If I am not careful my whole lower arm gets tight, but could be from the combination of both surgeries. Burt, the elbow area is doing okay- the therapist has been taping (with Keniseo tape) both areas and this does seem to help. I see the doctor on Tuesday. I still do n't have great grip strength and the pain in the forearm is finally feeling like it might be better, but I have not worked on any strengthening exercises yet- so for me the jury is still out!######I saw the hand surgeon yesterday and he thought things were looking good. I asked him about the pain in the forearm still and the lack of strength overall and he said that this was about the time that we could start to work on the strengthening. Guess I just am inpatient to see some change. He said the pain in the forearm is still normal at this point and should start to go away. He said that will have to be careful when strengthening in therapy as if we go to fast it will set me back. I am set to see him again in four weeks..######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

However I am to the point that I would do anything to get some relief.Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions.######Honestly, I do n't know what to tell you, other then I sympathize with you You have to do what you feel is best for you! ... Try the physical therapy... Surgery does help in some cases... Hopefully if you need surgery, you 'll be one of the lucky ones.######Change doctors. Ge an MRI & EMG done. If the results shoe CTS- Get surgery while it 's in it 's `early stages'. Wear wrist strengtheners at night & take a couple of pain killers, (with codeine if poss), about an hour before going to bed.######Me again. I 'm in England- and have just had CTS surgery in my left wrist, (last Friday). So far so good. I only got diagnosed CTS within the last few weeks, after MRI & EMG tests, after waking up one Sunday morning in excruciating pain in both arms/wrists. I have a six week recovery on this wrist, then the op on the next one. After only a few weeks on painkillers and great discomfort.... . the op has come as a blessing. Do n't be disheartened too much by the `failure stories' you read on this BB- there are far more successes than you 'll ever know about If you 're unsure about your treatment, tell your doctor. I 'll let you know how it goes for me here... at the moment on Day 3- i 'm waggling my fingers, stretching my wrist- experiencing similar pains as prior to the op, but not as brutal.

One of the medications that they have me on is prednisone. I was wondering what the side effects are. I have heard that it might cause a puffy appearance to the face and mayeb some acne. I am really worried about having a ``puffy '' face, so if anyone here takes prednisone, has taken it in the past, or knows someone who is one it, please please please tell me what you know. . I dont want to look nasty with a puffy face. By the way I 'm 14. - Madeline######Hi Madeline! I 'm sorry to hear that you have Crohn's Disease. That 's NO fun. I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis (also a form of IBD). I 'm 14 too. I was put on prednisone, a total of... 6 times in the past year. Whenever I was put on a really high dosage to control my `flare-ups ', I would get some acne on my face. It was n't that bad though. I also would get mood swings. I could really be a real witch at times, but people excused it because they knew it was the medicine. I also got the `jitters' a lot, and had trouble sleeping. Right now I 'm `weaning ' off prednisone. I 'm on 20 mg and going down, yeh! I 'm having to take it in the morning since I could n't sleep at nights from the `jitters'. When I first started taking it I got really worried about the puffy face too. However, it 's really easy to manage. Just watch your salt intake. Try to cut down on the amount of salt you eat in foods, like potato chips and pretzels. When ever I would get the puffiness (which really is n't that bad), I 'd just drink a lot of water. It goes away once you drink the water. I never found prednisone to actually help with my IBD, but apparently it has, because now (I just had my 3rd colonoscopy/enodoscopy done) and it turns out I 'm doing REALLY well. So there is hope. Good luck! And really do n't be scared about taking prednisone, the side effects (at least for me) were n't bad at all and about 2 weeks after you 're done taking the steriod, the side effects go away, no puffy face, no acne. It 's all gone once you 're done. So, hang in there !!! - Carlie######Carlie- Thank you SOOOOO much! That was the most encouraging reply that I have gotten. I went to a website today about teens with crohn's and everyone was so dicouraging, but you gave me hope! The only thing that really sucks is that I hated having the colonoscopy, and endoscopy (sp?) The prep for it was HORRIFIC, not being able to eat for 3 days and drinking that stuff that makes you throw up... and the cramps. . OH THE CRAMPS! I was hoping that I would only have to have it done once. I remember them putting me out (of course not ``all th way '' for whatever reasons they had) and I remember it really hurting too. . I guess I 'll just have to suck it up if I end up having ot get it done again. . but THANK you SO much for your reply! - Madeline######Madeline, I 'm sorry to hear that you got some discouraging stuff. Sometimes people get really down when they find out the have IBD. It 's not a fun disease to have, and people can get embarrassed. Expecially at our age. Anyways, OMG, I 'm right there with you. My first scope was horrible. Not only was I craving food so bad, but then you had to drink that stuff that made you sick as a dog. I figured ``Just get the test over with and you 'll be fine '', but then after the test I was even sicker. I was throwing up blood from the biopsies, hurting like you would n't beleive, etc.. But then the second scope I had went... better. This last one was n't too great. The day that I was n't allowed to eat was Halloween. Yeap! Of all days right? SO the whole time I was craving candy, but I pulled through and got wonderful news !!! It turns out that I 'm doing really really well !!! I 'm not in a flare-up and I feel pretty good !! So just goes to show that you can have good times too. And that 's what we have to remember. Living with IBD is tough, but it IS liveable. STAY STRONG HUN! You 're doin ' great. Oh! And do n't worry about getting another scope. I had to have so many because of other reasons (lot of weight loss) but usually you just have to have a scope once every 2-5 years unless you 're having a lot of flare-ups. - Carlie######Unfortunately, Prednisolone is a steroid and although steroids reduce inflammation, they have lots of side effects, such as steroid induced acne and long-term use can create steroid induced diabetes. That is the same reason that you are experiencing a puffy face. This I am afraid is typical of steroids and is called a `Moon Face'. You can also get an increase in appetite and can gain weight easily. Sorry not to bring more good news, but try to get off them asap as soon as your tummy is a bit better. There are more natural ways of reducing inflammation rather than steroids, but you would have to go and see an ND rather than an MD..######U guys have crohns? What kind of symptoms did you have that brought it about? let me know. Thanks######Plutoren12, One of the main things that made my family concerened about my health was that I have been underweight pretty much my entire life. Other symptoms were chronic diarea (I had it for like 4 or 5 months stragiht before the figured out what it was) Some rectal bleeding, a low grade fever usually at night, abdominal pain (usually after eating, but can be other times) and a pretty small appetite. MY family has also had a history of Crohn's (My uncle had it) I response to everyone else, I guess I 'm having good luck so far with prednisone! I havent experianced and side effects yet except I 'm a little emotional, and my face gets flushed a lot. But I only started at 40mg a day and every 2 weeks my Doctor is taking me down 10 mg, until I get down to 5mg a day, then I 'll stay at that. So it 's good i wont have to be on it for a long time! - Madeline######My younger brother has had Crohn's since he was 6 years old and is almost 16 now. He has been on Prednisone basically at least once a year except for a couple of years in middle school when he did n't get sick. But he has gotten a flare up every single winter since he was in 1st grade and diagnosed with it. Prednisone was what he was on a lot to control it. I guess I do have some words of encouragement. As for the puffiness, when Mike was a little kid, like between the ages of 6 and 9, his face blew up to the point where it did n't even look like him anymore. Living with him day in and day out, we did n't notice it as much... But looking back at pictures from when he was younger and on the steroid, he did n't even look like the same person. But he was on this medication last year again, when he was 14/15 years old, and it did not cause him that moon face that he had as a little kid. He also was not on as high of a dose, however, I think it is because he was older and his body took it better. When he 's not on Prednisone, and especially during a flare, his appetite is essentially non-existent. He does n't enjoy eating at all. On prednisone though, he used to wake my mom up at 6AM full of energy, starving for breakfast. It alters his personality a little bit, in that his appetite basically triples and his energy is through the roof. Yes, acne can be a side effect, and there may be others, just like any drug. But just remember that this helps you It always got rid of his flares and helped him heal, and that 's what we all wanted for him. Do n't worry girl, you 'll be aight######Hi Madeline, I am 40 years of age and have had Crohn's since I was 17 but only diagnosed 9 years ago. It took a long time to find out what was wrong. It is very hereditary as my 4 other brothers and sisters all have either Colitis or Crohn's or both. We all have different symptoms, mine was the most severe as I was the only one with pain. I have been on Prednisone and a relatively new drug called Entocort (mild to moderate) and is a steroid. It did not help. The prednisone did help, I am overweight but did not get the moonface, everyone reacts different to meds. I felt great on the prednisone but then I was on it too long and I have weak muscles and nerves and hopefully should go away. Dont stay on Prednisone too long. As for the diahrea, get your doctor to prescribe Cholestyramine, it works, I take one pack a day, it takes like crap but it stops you (within 2 hours) from going contstantly and takes the cramps away. Dont ever pick up smoking and alcohol, they irritate the bowels more, avoid caffein as well. Chew your food well and small quantities 5-6 times a day. I have had surgery 8 years ago and was perfect up to about 2 years ago and now I need to have it done again. I hope this helps, there will be a cure, think positive and good luck in the future. Penny######I have Crohn's and I am on prednisone. I did n't get acne but I do have a puffy face ``chipmunk cheeks '' and my stomach is also bigger and puffy. I was taking up to 120mg a day but I 'm only on 10mg a day and next week I 'll be down to 5mg. The prednisone has also made me pretty cranky and very irritable.

All cramps and diarea have stopped... I am going on my 3rd treatment... but I still have to be careful what I eat or else... I went from 128 lbs. to 102 lbs. in 6 weeks... I am still at 102... but I stopped losing... the meds I am on cause loss of appetite... so some times I force my self to eat... I am still looking for answers to what causes Crohn's... no one is quiet sure... my doctor told me I have an over-active immune system that caused it... some research blames stress... but I do n't think stress causes Crohn's... I think Crohn's causes stress... My prayers go out for all of you. ------------------ Anastasie######I know it 's a few years later than when you posted this... but I am 24 and was just diagnosed with Crohn's a few months ago. None of the treatments have worked for me so far so they are trying the Remacaid Infusion Treatments. I was wondering how they worked for you. If they seemed to help at all. If you felt a little more like yourself. I have a beautiful daughter to take care of and I 'm finding myself in the bathroom almost all day and very fatigued (falling asleep while playing with her) and very tense. I 'm hoping to hear some good stuff about this new treatment they are presenting to me. I think I 'm starting next week. Hope all is going well with the control and treatment of your disease! Thank you for your time.######Remicade was great I felt so much better. HOWEVER... what doctors fail to tell you is that Remicade can cause scarring or strictures to form and the you may need surgery to relieve the area. I was just released from the hospital because of my stricture that caused and obstruction. I choose not to have the surgery for now and pted to have a balloon procedure. Talk to your Doctor about thsi. There really is very little info on the downside of remicade (which is why I decided to take it...) Good luck!######hi this is a good post im 15 years old and the doctors think i have some kind of IBD, i had a colonscopy done in may and they lost my biopsie results so now i have to go threw the colonscopy and a endoscopy again and it hurt so much last time im absolute dreading it! if anyone can give me some information about IBD i would appreciate it thanks.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Ever since I 've been diagnosed, I have a hard time staying healthy. It seems like I always have some sort of cold or flu. I lack energy most of the time too. When i was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis my GI put me on 9 pills of Sulfasalazin a day. Than last November i was put on a prednisone taper. In December i was given a colonoscopy and the GI could not find any sign of Ulcerative Colitis. So he took me off all medication because he said the medication (Sulfasalazin) could cause symptoms like UC flare ups. I was doing well for about a month with no medication, then I started having extreme pain, and I was going to the bathroom 8 to 10 times a day. I was throwing up all the time and could barely keep any kind of food or drink in my stomach. 2 weeks ago I went back in and saw my GI and he put me back on the Sulfasalazin (6 pills a day) and I 'm on the predinisone taper again. About a week after I started the medicine, I noticed blood in my stool. Now my GI wants to do a Sigmoidosopy. Please give me some feedback about your experiences, advice, or encourgament.######Hey there... you are going through the same things I started with. I was diagnosed in 2000. The sulfasalizine worked for a while, then I went to mesalomine, then to prednisone taper, to IV prednisone, to more and more meds. I would have probably done well on the oral meds but my UC was so bad that I very rarely went into a full remission for long. The prednisone helped temporarily for a few weeks, then the bleeding would start again. I know what you are going through... My family tried to understand how I was feeling but I believe they never quite grasped the social isolation I felt. I very rarely went places for fear that I could n't find a bathroom in time. The urgency to go was awful. I remember trying to leave my house to go to the library one day while having a bad flare and having to quickly drive back into my driveway to run to the bathroom three times before I could actually get on the road. It was awful. Please feel free to write and ask me any questions you may have. I no longer have UC. I had an colectomy, I have worn an illeotomy pouch, then had take down surgery and now have a j-pouch. I am doing much better but now my daughter has now also been diagnosed with UC. While I am no expert, I believe my past experiences with the sleepless nights sitting on the pot, the butt burn, the food challenge, the social isolation, the dehydration, the muscle cramping and the forever lookout for the next bathroom or porta-potty allows me to know what you are going through and to be able to assure you that are not alone. I will tell you things I went through if you ask and I will try to help you in spirit if in no other way. Be sure to always keep your doctor informed in any new symptoms or changes. Take care and love yourself... Louise56.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

He has the J pouch. He had some stomach issues this week and went to the gasto and he saw an ulcer in or by the pouch and is testing him for crohn's. It can just be pouchitis. Did anyone here ever hear of someone having both diseases? My husband is so nervous he ca n't go to work. Any advice/input would help.######UC and Crohn's are very similar diseases. Both are inflammatory disorders, but UC is only in the colon and Crohn's can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus. I 've always thought them to be the same expect for the location, but I may be interpreting the information I am reading wrong. I hope the paste below helps some. I hope your husband gets well fast. From the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America's web site ``Ulcerative colitis differs from another inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease. Crohn's can affect any area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the small intestine and colon. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, affects only the colon. The inflammation involves the entire rectum and extends up the colon in a continuous manner. There are no areas of normal intestine between the areas of diseased intestine. In contrast, such so-called ``skip '' areas may occur in Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis affects only the innermost lining of the colon, whereas Crohn's disease can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall. ''######thank you zoegirl. I just wanted to know how common it is to have both. I thought it was very rare to get both.######My guess is he probably had Crohn's all along. I just had an appt with a new Gastro and two years ago I was told I had crohn's. . today he said it was more likely to be UC (tests were ordered). UC is in the lining and Crohn's can go all the way through the bowel wall. Good luck to your husband and your quest for answers! Cheri######Please get enterric coated fish oil capsules. Enterric coated omega 3 will sooth and heal the lesions. Heavy doses at first like 300 mg every 4 hours and do this for a number of days. As you feel better you can take a lot less. Finding the product is a bit hard but it is out there. It must be ENTERRIC coated.######my daughteer was diagonised with crohn's this aug she turn 12 in oct her gast. doc did biopsas to see which 1 but when he did the colon scope he pretty much knew it was crohn good luck with your husband my daughter now has to take 11 pills a day good luck######I have known of a couple people on a different forum that have both diseases. It IS possible, but very rare. It could also be Crohn's colitis. ZoeGirl: what tests did they do before to dx you with CD? Just wondering why they did n't think UC before...######I just saw this post. They did a colonoscopy and by my symptoms treated me of Crohn's. I was better a couple of years before problems again. Went to a new gastro who then suspected UC. Turns out it was n't either. My gallbladder was n't functioning so they removed it. I had a rough recovery but I think I am finally getting better. Oh and I also have some gastritis and ``non specific colitis '' but neither seem to bother me.######My mom just had her gallbladder out. She feels much better, too. I do n't have any upper right pain, though.######I did n't have any right sided pain either. All lower abdominal and left side.######I am pretty confused. Hopefully soon I will get it figured out. I am pretty sure I do NOT have UC, so it 's just now the question of: do I have CD? A couple more tests & I should know for sure... hopefully...######I was told that I did n't have crohn's with this new gastro because of a blood test available that did n't show markers? I guess they did n't have it when I went a couple years ago. So right off the bat they told me I did n't have Crohn's. I had a tearing feeling and blood/mucus on my stools at first, but then it progressed to cramping that left me crying most days. . which is when they found the gallbladder. . they ordered a HIDA scan just for the heck of it... he did n't even think that was the problem. I 'm still not 100% and we thought maybe I had something on top of the GB but I 'm riding it out for a while. I have discomfort but not pain, so as far as I am concerned I am feeling pretty well. I hope you feel better soon. Seems like you have many things going on at once!######I think that 's the problem. Too many symptoms, no one knows what is related to what. I am having the blood test, but I was told it was NOT 100 &#37;, so originally they did n't want me to have it, due to cost. But now they are trying to figure it out so I guess I am going to have it. I did have colitis in my first scope, but this one seemed normal with no ulcers this time, so I am just waiting for the biopsies to come back to know for sure. She said I will take the blood test next if biopsies do n't show anything & we will go from there. She said it may just be a bacterial infection that made me really really sick. (for 10 + months!) But I had a small bowel follow through that showed inflammation, so who knows. I do n't know if a bacterial infection would show that as well? But right now I am just guessing... I have to wait & see on this one. Then I have fluid in my ear & mastoid sinus that wo n't go away. Constant muffled sounds & fluid moving sounds, popping & discomfort. I finally am going to an ENT to get rid of this. I also had ovarian cyst issues. Just had laproscopic surgery & hysteroscopy D&C 2 weeks ago. The big cyst was gone by then. All female parts look fine. But no explanation on why I had my period for 6 weeks... I am waiting on this one as well... I have to wait & see how this next period goes & if I have constant bleeding again to see this pans out. If I still bleed, I will be leaning towards a thyroid issue. Then I have a rib that is subluxed where it connects to my spine. I have had this for months as well. I wish my osteo could get it back in. I have been having steroid injections in it & that has helped, but I want it to go away... Now I am having this horrible pelvis, hip, SI, & low back pain. I am going to pick my osteo's brain about this in 2 weeks. So maybe the biopsies will tell me more. Maybe I do n't have IBD like my GI thought !!!.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

It 's Crohn's Colitis. It means Crohn's disease in the colon. (not Crohn's/ Colitis which would mean both or either) I 'm concerned with one statement you said. . ``I believe that he can overcome this problem ''. It 's not a problem. It 's a disease he will have for the rest of his life. The disease attacks the entire wall of the intestine, from the inside to the outside. ALL of it. It can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus. It can be in one place as well as another. Surgery will not cure the disease. A person who has Crohn's will also have other physical manifestations. It can affect the eyes, joints, muscles, liver, kidneys. A person with Crohn's disease can have severe intestinal blockages where emergency surgery is necessary. The possibility that your friend may have to have his colon removed is a distinct possibility. Crohn's disease can cause abscesses and then eventually fistulas. Those are basically tunnels from organ to organ. So, imagine a disease that just burrows holes in the body. Medications for a person with Crohn's disease can also have serious side effects. Some cause allergic reactions. Some medications may work, others may not. It takes many years for a person with Crohn's disease to get to know the reality of it-- a hell disease, and I truly feel for him. So, it 's not a problem. Overcoming it is n't a priority in one's life as is learning to accept and live WITH it. And, that can take a while. OK, soapbox put away. You 're a wonderful friend who has extended your heart to someone who has something potentially debilitating. If you want to know what to do, educate yourself about Crohn's disease. Your friend may misunderstand your intent on being there for him. Sometimes, it 's just difficult to have friends, because dealing with oneself takes up a lot of time-- and it 's just easier at times to not have to explain what 's wrong. There are many fears, there is much pain, and talking about bowel movements, pain, gas, diarrhea, constipation... is n't something that everyone wants to hear. Some people CA N't talk about their disease. He may not be able to relay his feelings about the whole thing, or he just does n't care to talk about it and it 's not important to him. Bathrooms are almost always on the mind of one with CD. He will possibly be fussy with foods-- not eating many. Your friend will have to find the balance. That means to have friends who understand, friends who just listen, friends who can just be normal... etc.. Words of encouragement can definitely be taken the wrong way. Ask how he 's doing, ask what meds the docs have him on, ask him how he 's feeling... etc.. You could also openly ask him what he would like from you as a friend. Just be you, and be understanding, and know that if he says he 's not feeling well, he probably is n't. If you are true in your intent, it will work as any relationship. It grows, has ups and downs, continues or does n't. Try not to have too many expectations. Your friend will be going through tough times, and you as his friend sometimes takes the brunt of emotional relief. You are a person with feelings as well. Just because dealing with chronic disease is difficult, it does n't allow one to be rude or disrespectful. But, there will definitely be moments. It 's tough having a relationship with no health problems involved. It 's tougher when that can sometimes when health is a primary focus. I wish you both the best, and that your friend is able to get his CD stablised and out of the hospital soon. quincy######Yeah I know that he ca n't just get rid of it. . I was kind of meaning get over it mentally and live life like a normal 17 yr old, just with a few minor adjustments. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I 'm trying to learn as much as i can about this diease, but there is so much info to take in. I will keep researching. Hopefully I can talk with him about this and he 'll probably notice that I 'm trying my best, but at times it 's hard to comprehend EVERYTHING! (I think that my friend has a calstomy (spelling?) bag, so i do n't think that he has to worry about the bathroom as much) Thanks Quincy !! You helped me a bunch !!!######Hey Quincy and supermichelle! Quincy, first of all, I 'd like to say that was a wonderful post, but wow, you really made Crohn's seem horrible. Do you have a really bad case of it? I mean, it CAN be horrible, but most cases do n't have to be. Many cases of Crohn's, in fact, can be bad for a few weeks, but then go in to remission for many months to years. You are right though, many people learn to live with it and deal with the relapses. A couple of things I wanted to add (I hope you do n't mind quincy). I am not a fan of calling the disease ``Crohn's colitis '' because you get mixed up with the names. Crohn's disease along with ulcerative colitis, are two separate (and totally different) diseases which make up the entity known as inflammatory bowel disease (NOT to be confused with irritable bowel syndrome). Crohn's as quincy said can involve any part of the GI tract from the gum to the bum. Though most cases involve the small bowel in some way (usually the terminal ileum). Crohn's has a patchy look to it when you look at it through a colonoscope, and it involves inflammation through the entire thickness of the bowel wall (again, like quincy said). Ulcerative colitis is a little bit different. It usually ONLY involves the large bowel. It always involves the rectum and in different patients, continues upstream to various degrees. Ulcerative colitis only involves the most superficial layers of the bowel wall.######Hi butterflytrans, No, I have ulcerative colitis... limited to the distal part (rectum/sigmoid). A mild case controlled by 5ASA meds. I have a great doctor and have had it for almost 18 years, but diagnosed 15 + years ago. Now, why would I mind clarification... you 're an equal member of this board and I certainly do n't know everything ;--RRB- Clarify away. Crohn's in the colon IS called Crohn's colitis. I understand that term clearly, but many people think it can be Crohn's with ulcerative colitis. But, I do understand why you 'd be averse to the term. One can not have both at the same time (as clarified and confirmed by my doctor)... contrary to what people may believe. The term colitis is loose... but Crohn's colitis is definitely in the bowel. Not all the bowel, but in the bowel. One can also have Ileitis, and Crohn's colitis at the same time... etc.. With ulcerative colitis, one can have backwash ileitis... that 's where it 's just into the ileum from the ``backwash '' from cecum involvement at the opening of the appendix. One with ulcerative colitis can also have severe rectal involvement as well as cecum involvement with all the rest of the colon clear. But, it ALWAYS starts at the anus and is n't patchy throughout the colon as you stated. Crohn's can also have severe anal/rectal involvement and is much times confused with ulcerative colitis. When the fistulas start showing up... it 's definitely crohn's. (I have a friend with this and it 's hell for her... but she 's handling it very well-- I 'm in awe!) I never knew this until her experience. UC and CD are two different diseases for sure... but there are some that believe otherwise (small following). Methinks it 's because the beginning stages of CD in the colon looks like and acts like UC. In any event, the first prescribed meds (usually 5ASA) for both would work in treating the inflammation. Do you have UC or CD? Where is yours and what meds are you on? How are you doing at this time? Thanks for the input... any that is valid always is helpful and NECESSARY it seems. Talk soon, quincy######Please take my bluntness in stride... it 's not meant to be rude, just educational. Minor adjustments ?? I do n't think so... Learning to live with a colostomy (a bag that your stool is stored into) would be difficult especially at first. As a matter of fact it 's my biggest fear (I have UC). As well, there may be future surgeries which would be possible so that the bag is in the body instead of out of it. Both have to be emptied, cleaned meticulously so that infection does n't set in... etc.. It 's a different way of life and would definitely take more than just a minor adjustment. How do you feel when you get our period? Do you have to change pads, tampons, is n't it a pain to have to deal with that once a day? In comparison... imagine having to deal with poop, not blood on something that can just be discarded and another one attached or inserted and away you go. With the bags, they would have to be emptied many times a day. I understand they 're also noisy... something else to be a reminder and possibly something to hide. He 's not a normal 17 year old. His body is changed and functions differently now. There will be many issues that he will have to face, intimacy being one of them. But, this has happened to him when he 's young, and life goes on. You 're still on the right track tho, but find out what surgery he had to have done. Read up about colostomy (removal of the colon and replaced by an external bag), and the various Crohn's surgeries. That can open the door to discussion and questions to him... at least if he uses terminology, you 'll understand it. There are complications at times, but it 's not necessarily the norm. One has to recuperate after surgery and that does take time. Meds will still be required. You can find out about that as well. Remember, you 're not living with it... and YOU 'RE overwhelmed by the info. keep it all in perspective for you wo n't learn it all in a short period of time. It 's understandable for sure. It all takes time, just go along with the process and just deal with each day as it comes. It 's not a straight forward disease. Let your friend set the pace. Intake of info from any avenue varies with everyone. You seem like a great friend and with good friends, the ups and downs of recovery can be smoother. Maybe through this... you 'll pursue a career in the medical field ?? ;--RRB- I wish you the best, quincy######Small note... UC always involves the rectum, not the anus. Anal involvement with UC obviously exists, but as you have said earlier, that is more common with CD. Seeing patients having to deal with fistulas and fissures is quite eye-opening as you come to the realization they have to live with it every day. I 've also seen a few cases of perianal sepsis eventually leading to severe fistula formation... not fun... especially after the infection has cleared up and their fistulae are treated with the cutting setons. Again... not fun. Quincy, do you have any extraintestinal symptoms of UC? Any problems with sclerosing cholangitis?######Hi, What you say is true... but UC does start at the anus (internal). Maybe there 's inflammation there, but not active disease... (have n't done any searching about that part... but it 's stated that it starts at the anus, not at the rectum). Definitely not active disease as in CD which is external anus as well. Maybe talking about anal involvement means external ??? Interesting... maybe just perspective. But, those with a colectomy (UC only)... if the anus has n't been removed, for some there is still disease involvement and eventually an analectomy has to be done. So, it still involves the anus. Interesting you mentioned PSC... it 's been suspect because of my increased liver enzymes 7 or so years ago. That was a ride for sure. I did n't have the internet at that time, and a friend printed about a 2 inch stack of info. As I hilighted it I basically cried for 2 weeks. One piece of info helped alleviate my distress... a doctor was against the ERCP as a test tool, stating the incidence of pancreatitis and triggering PSC in people who only may have had the potential for it to happen maybe many years down the road was way too high, so it should only be done in people where other symptoms where almost positive that PSC was active. So, I nixed the ERCP and my doctors agreed. So far, my enzymes are steady at the elevated level... so unless they start to increase, it 's not a concern. The specialist said that the fact that I 'm female would be a probability that I do n't have it anyway... What are statistics anyway, I 've never been one that fits in with statistics... My sister has 3 ERCPs done for gallbladder disease and now had pancreatitis. I was n't willing to risk the probablility of getting that as well. Other manifestations are body pain, slight eye problems, some mouth cankers that come and go. Nothing severely problematic or OBVIOUS... but I 've had many little things forever... so who knows. My dad had ankylosing spondylitis. . there 's a connection for sure. I also have asthma (inherited from my mom's side of the family)... but there are many who seem to have both UC and asthma. . so who really knows. How about you? Do you have UC or CD, and what other connected manifestations to you have? How long? , what meds, etc? Thanks, quincy######Tell him to discuss intravenous Remacaid (Remacade) w/ his docs. DH had Crohn's for a couple of years, was on prednisone and some other drug, did the dietary restrictions and all, finally had a massive bleed-out and got one treatment of IV Remacaid and his Crohn's is \* GONE \*! It IS curable, no lie.######Hey quincy... I do n't have either... I just know a lot about the subject because of what I do. Skyspinner, remicaide is often a good treatment, but it does n't cure the disease. It just puts it in to remission. The tendency for bowel inflammation is still there, and if you trigger it again, it 'll come right back. Plus, remicaide is very expensive and it can have a lot of side-effects... especially allergic stuff and anaphylactic shock. Remicaide is a good solution for people who have failed other treatments, but it is by no means a panacea.######Ah, how so? You work for a GI? First hand info for sure !! I have the best one in the world ;--RRB-... I hope he never retires. Of course, that 's mighty selfish of me, is n't it... but I 've received such good treatment and his philosophy of treatment definitely suited me, and for that, I 'm grateful! I had one instance where I had to see another doc in the same clinic because my doc had an emergency. That doc told me bluntly that if I were his patient, he would have had me on prednisone immediately. I was shocked and said that I was relieved he was n't my doctor. I shudder to think how I 'd have been if that was the first line of treatment-- not so for where mine is. 5ASA rocks for sure! Your input is definitely invaluable on the boards, thanks for the input. Best to you, quincy######No... it 's a \* treatment \*.######Hi, Had to voice my opinion on Crohn's, my niece 18 years has just been told she has crohns and she needed 5 pints of blood, due to blood lose, she is on meds. now, we thought she was never going to feel better, but she has had many good days where she can function and even spend time with her friends, which she was too sick to do before. It takes time for meds. to start to help, not cure it but help people with it make it thro the day. We pray that with all the testing that they will find a cure, but in the mean time we have to support her, knowing everyday can chage how she functions, but she has bad days, but for every good day we feel blessed. She also takes alot of imodium, I dont know if it is the right thing to do, but if she feels better taking we dont say anything. Also being stressed is very bad for crohns, try to talk to your friend and express your conserns for his health, and how important it is to stick by him and try to keep his stress level as low as possible. He will be our prayers and I like you pray for a cure for crohns in our life time. best of luck Cookie######hi, im dennis i had crohns for 10 years.been to all the doctors, they tell me the same thing but nothing helps.i lose 22lbs, so sick i cant even drive a car.after i did get over it some what, i found a that colonics and enemas was the only thing that would help me.a lot of people thinks its crazy for doing colonics and enemas.i did to at frist, but i tried everything that the doctors said and it wasnt working, so why not.im gald i did, i havnt felt so good in many years.i dont know now bad hes got it, but i had it pretty bad only thing that i know that could help.######Hi Dennis, Just read your post and am wondering if you ever lost blood? My niece loses blood to the point she needs transfusions. She has been doing fairly good the last couple of weeks, but the other day she had blood again. I have read many post about crohns, and do not see anyone write about losing blood, so I am confused, do people with crohns lose blood or is it unusual for that to happen. Any reply would be welcomed. Thanks for any help Cookie######hi cookie51, yes i do lose blood, but not that bad.my blood count is mostly low when its checked.and i see blood when i go to the bathroom, but thats from my rectum because i had crohns in my rectum, and with a flare up its very bad.but it will go away in about 2 or 3 weeks.i use a anal cream to help heal me. i had crohns through out my colon from my rectum up to the middle and top of it.am sure during a flare up when i get really sick i to might bleed on up in my colon.but i havent been that sick in sometime now.the enemas and colonics they work, they did for me.only thing i can say is try it to see if it will work for her.there is a certain way my doctor told me to do the enemas.wish u the best.######Hi Denniss, My niece had alittle blood the other day now it has stopped. Also my sister has hemeriods and they too were bleeding so bad that they gave her 2 pints of blood. They gave her a cream and that seems to help, but my niece, she cant eat many things, she says it is like eating glass.She will not touch anything with mayonase in it, she gets really sick from that. She eats like a bird, so afraid of the pain, that she eats very little. I would appreciate any tips you have that I can relay to her that could help her. Hope You Have A Great Night Cookie######there is foods i cant eat, and am sure there will be foods she cant eat without getting sick.it depends on the person on what foods you can eat and can not eat.she will have to make a list of the ones that make her sick or just remmeber them, not to eat them. and what well help her, like i said before i use enemas to keep my colon clean.and it works for me, or colonics i use them to. i would try enemas first they worked good for me.am in kentucky what state are u in? hope i helped######Hi Denniss, I am from Il., and my niece is starting to realize what foods make her sick, I know rice and mayo, make her sick, she stopped eating any chinese food. We have a friend who is in his 40's and he has had crohns since he was 18, he said his flares up from time to time, but he said he never had any bleeding. That makes me scared, because my niece still has bouts where she bleeds. I know they said she has 3 feet of her bowel is effected, did they ever tell you how much colon is effected? Well I guess the best thing she can do right now is watch her diet, and stay away from foods that triger it. Thank you for your reply Hope You have a great day cookie######before i started enemas and colonics i had flare ups and my rectum would bleed all the time with a very low blood count.now that i keep my colon clean i havnt been sick at all or felt bad, i have had a couple of rectum flare ups.but the cream i use heals that. you never said anything about getting her to start with enemas.i started with 2 enemas a week, or a colonic and 1 enema a week.get her to try it, just make sure shes not doing any rectum bleeding.######Hi Denniss, I told my sister today about you and she said my niece has diarria all the time, so did you? She take imodiom all the time, if not she has to run to the bathroom all the time.I am curious if you had that problem, or was it the opposite, where you not able to go? I thank you for your input, we are just now learning about crohns, so any input is great. Thanks again cookie######hi cookie, yes i did have diarria all the time, i could even drink water and it would run through me.a lot of over the counter meds like that imodiom she wont be able to take it could cause flare ups and make her sick.thats what i was telling u about the enemas.the enemas stopped my diarria after about 2 weeks..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

After years of Prednisone in the late 80's I required surgery and opted for a restorative J-Pouch. Unfortunately, it really is not curative. Most `Pouchers' have a new form of inflammation of the Anastomosis, Rectal Cuff, and Small Bowel called Pouchitis. Pain is very similar to UC and Crohn's. Cramps, Gas, Sweating, Fever, Urge, and local bottom pain. What meds work for your pain?######I guess I will answer my own question... I 've had GI pain for 25 years. Ulcerative Colitis, Surgery, and now Crohn's. Finally, a couple of years ago I decided to do something about pain since it was driving me nuts. Since posting this I have tried OxyContin after using Norco for a couple of years. OxyContin works really well for GI distress; slows the gut, kills pain and cramps, and generally restored my function. Only problem with OxyContin was anxiety, it was high so I switched to which is a powerful Opiate that lasts a solid 8-10 hours. It is a pretty amazing medication. For Crohn's and UC sufferers, try to stay away from Short-Acting Narcotics like Vicodin, Percocet, and Norco. You will end up chasing the relief, counting pills, and becoming mental about it. Best to use a Long-Acting (LA) med, and have a supply of Short-Acting meds for (BT) breakthrough pain. This approach is a fairly standard practice in the pain management world. Bottom line: Pain meds have been a good addition to my other GI meds. Currently I 'm taking Prednsione, EntoCort, Xifaxan, Cipro, Lomotil, Hyoscyamine and Cortisone Enemas. ~######Hello... I also have UC for a year now and im only 24... My pain doctor gave me vicodin... yes it doesnt workvery well buti dont want to make myself look bad for stronger dose... can you help me what to say? for my next appointment on August 27... i always be prepared until i see doctor i become egg jello... He would ask me if i take 3 times a day... i lied to make myself lookgood... but i ran out fewweeksearlier going through withdrawing is the worse for my pain as UC patient... Please hellp and ill write it down what to say from you next time to see doctor so i dont change my mind... thank you!

He had a bout of pouchitis and while back, and still feeling some pain in stomach for past couple weeks- doctor did a capsule endo and said he had inflammation in ilieum. He also took a blood test which came back with a diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis again ????? How can that be? Or did he mean crohn's? Anyone hear of that?######As far as I know, once your colon is removed completely, your UC will be cured. If your husband has inflammation of his small intestine, it would seem much more likely that he has Crohn's. It is possible, however, to have both crohn's and colitis, so perhaps he had both to begin with. There is a blood test that shows definitively whether you have UC or crohn's and biopsies should also reveal this. My best advice would be to speak to his GI about the possible causes, and make sure you get the answers you need before you leave..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

Fifth and 47######The weird thing about certain viruses is that they can initially incite inflammation in certain joints, they can also result in something called a post-infectious arthritis where the virus is actually gone from the body, but for some reason or another the immune system stays revved up and attacks the joints resulting in inflammation. It 's interesting you say you have Crohn's disease which, as you know, can have extraintestinal manifestations the most common being what is called an enteropathic arthritis. Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus, and it 's one of the most common viral infections passed from children to adults (the other being varicella or chickenpox to non-immune adults). It can result in arthritis of large joints like the knee or ankle, but it can also result in semi-mobile joint arthritis i.e. between the ribs and the sternum. This inflammation can go on for months and really cause a lot of problem for the person who has it. Question for you: have you recently been on any prednisone for your Crohn disease, and if so, did the prednisone help with the chest pain? If your doctor thinks the pain is coming from the heart (which is obviously possible) have you had a stress test done? Have you tried any non-steroidal antiinflammatories such as naproxen? (be careful, though if you try this group of drugs as they can cause stomach problems if taken for too long)..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

First-line is 5ASA meds, oral and rectal. Is it you who has it or someone else? q######my bf. nothing has helped him. the doc just gives him levsin and bentyl but they do n't work.######I 've found that the steroid enemas (hydrocortizone) work the best! Right now I 'm also on pregnizone, but I think it 's really the enemas that are making a BIG difference. If you have n't tried them, I would def. ask you doc.######Did the doc say your boyfriend has colitis or ulcerative colitis? Is he seeing a gastrointestinal doctor? or is it just the GP? How long has he had it? What symptoms is he having? Bentyl and levsin are both antispasmodics... if he indeed has ulcerative colitis, he should be on medications to stop the inflammation by treatment, and then meds for maintenance. What meds before has he been on? I would n't suggest prednisone before he 's had any of the 5ASA meds... both oral and rectal. Where in the colon is his UC... limited or throughout?

He has the J pouch. He had some stomach issues this week and went to the gasto and he saw an ulcer in or by the pouch and is testing him for crohn's. It can just be pouchitis. Did anyone here ever hear of someone having both diseases? My husband is so nervous he ca n't go to work. Any advice/input would help.######UC and Crohn's are very similar diseases. Both are inflammatory disorders, but UC is only in the colon and Crohn's can be anywhere from the mouth to the anus. I 've always thought them to be the same expect for the location, but I may be interpreting the information I am reading wrong. I hope the paste below helps some. I hope your husband gets well fast. From the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America's web site ``Ulcerative colitis differs from another inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease. Crohn's can affect any area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the small intestine and colon. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, affects only the colon. The inflammation involves the entire rectum and extends up the colon in a continuous manner. There are no areas of normal intestine between the areas of diseased intestine. In contrast, such so-called ``skip '' areas may occur in Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis affects only the innermost lining of the colon, whereas Crohn's disease can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall. ''######thank you zoegirl. I just wanted to know how common it is to have both. I thought it was very rare to get both.######My guess is he probably had Crohn's all along. I just had an appt with a new Gastro and two years ago I was told I had crohn's. . today he said it was more likely to be UC (tests were ordered). UC is in the lining and Crohn's can go all the way through the bowel wall. Good luck to your husband and your quest for answers! Cheri######Please get enterric coated fish oil capsules. Enterric coated omega 3 will sooth and heal the lesions. Heavy doses at first like 300 mg every 4 hours and do this for a number of days. As you feel better you can take a lot less. Finding the product is a bit hard but it is out there. It must be ENTERRIC coated.######my daughteer was diagonised with crohn's this aug she turn 12 in oct her gast. doc did biopsas to see which 1 but when he did the colon scope he pretty much knew it was crohn good luck with your husband my daughter now has to take 11 pills a day good luck######I have known of a couple people on a different forum that have both diseases. It IS possible, but very rare. It could also be Crohn's colitis. ZoeGirl: what tests did they do before to dx you with CD? Just wondering why they did n't think UC before...######I just saw this post. They did a colonoscopy and by my symptoms treated me of Crohn's. I was better a couple of years before problems again. Went to a new gastro who then suspected UC. Turns out it was n't either. My gallbladder was n't functioning so they removed it. I had a rough recovery but I think I am finally getting better. Oh and I also have some gastritis and ``non specific colitis '' but neither seem to bother me.######My mom just had her gallbladder out. She feels much better, too. I do n't have any upper right pain, though.######I did n't have any right sided pain either. All lower abdominal and left side.######I am pretty confused. Hopefully soon I will get it figured out. I am pretty sure I do NOT have UC, so it 's just now the question of: do I have CD? A couple more tests & I should know for sure... hopefully...######I was told that I did n't have crohn's with this new gastro because of a blood test available that did n't show markers? I guess they did n't have it when I went a couple years ago. So right off the bat they told me I did n't have Crohn's. I had a tearing feeling and blood/mucus on my stools at first, but then it progressed to cramping that left me crying most days. . which is when they found the gallbladder. . they ordered a HIDA scan just for the heck of it... he did n't even think that was the problem. I 'm still not 100% and we thought maybe I had something on top of the GB but I 'm riding it out for a while. I have discomfort but not pain, so as far as I am concerned I am feeling pretty well. I hope you feel better soon. Seems like you have many things going on at once!######I think that 's the problem. Too many symptoms, no one knows what is related to what. I am having the blood test, but I was told it was NOT 100 &#37;, so originally they did n't want me to have it, due to cost. But now they are trying to figure it out so I guess I am going to have it. I did have colitis in my first scope, but this one seemed normal with no ulcers this time, so I am just waiting for the biopsies to come back to know for sure. She said I will take the blood test next if biopsies do n't show anything & we will go from there. She said it may just be a bacterial infection that made me really really sick. (for 10 + months!) But I had a small bowel follow through that showed inflammation, so who knows. I do n't know if a bacterial infection would show that as well? But right now I am just guessing... I have to wait & see on this one. Then I have fluid in my ear & mastoid sinus that wo n't go away. Constant muffled sounds & fluid moving sounds, popping & discomfort. I finally am going to an ENT to get rid of this. I also had ovarian cyst issues. Just had laproscopic surgery & hysteroscopy D&C 2 weeks ago. The big cyst was gone by then. All female parts look fine. But no explanation on why I had my period for 6 weeks... I am waiting on this one as well... I have to wait & see how this next period goes & if I have constant bleeding again to see this pans out. If I still bleed, I will be leaning towards a thyroid issue. Then I have a rib that is subluxed where it connects to my spine. I have had this for months as well. I wish my osteo could get it back in. I have been having steroid injections in it & that has helped, but I want it to go away... Now I am having this horrible pelvis, hip, SI, & low back pain. I am going to pick my osteo's brain about this in 2 weeks. So maybe the biopsies will tell me more. Maybe I do n't have IBD like my GI thought !!!.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Crohn's Disease/ Ulcerative Colitis

However, I found out later that the colonoscopy charge at the facility will be nearly$ 900- that does n't include the doctor's fee, the anethesiologist, or biopsy fee if necessary. My question is this: is there a benefit to having a diagnosis of crohn's vs not? A little background: my flare-ups are mild- I have mild to moderate lower right abdominal pain (the worst pain is actually in my back in the same location). I have constipation rather than D, but when I was younger would have short flare-ups of D that would wake me at night. I have n't lost weight, but my appetite is much less with the most recent pain. I 'm not keen on going on long-term medications if I can avoid it, especially with mild symptoms. Any advice would be greatly appreciated- I 've got this colonoscopy scheduled for Monday !!######It only makes sense to have a scope if it 's suspected you have CD and to be on meds if you need to. Crohn's can affect the entire wall of the digestive tract (wherever its location). Sometimes strictures can happen from continued inflammation. I know it costs to have it done, but you should make sure. One possibility is that your small intestine may have an area, and you may need another scope for that.

One person's inflammation may be triggered by wheat while another person may be triggered by some other food or combination of foods. We wo n't know for sure unless we can get a lot of people- on this board- who are willing to try eating the recommended foods for their blood type. They would have to follow all the rules for at least two weeks. What are the chances of that happening?######I just started looking into his theories of blood type and what you should and should not eat. I also have symptoms of IBS. I have switched to eating a lot of rice and I feel better and my almost chronic diarrhea has stopped. Can you tell me which of the books on the blood type diet are the best and most informative? They been out for quite a while so there are lots of them. But when I googled the lists of foods, I noticed that the foods listed for AB + blood (my daughter inherited it from me) are the ones I have naturally gone to as they make me feel the best. Thanks......... Jenny######The first book I read, about four years ago, was from the library and I do n't remember the title. The book I have now is a hard cover that I bought from a local book store (used but like new). I believe the copyright date is 1996. The cover reads as follows: 4 Blood Types 4 Diets ``Eat Right For Your Type '' The Individulized Diet Solution...... Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo with Catherine Whitney After you posted, I searched for a list of his books and was surprised at how many there are.

He have too know that is not true######mariskaneni, Except in a very few cases, the actual CAUSE of carpal tunnel syndrome is not known. It is usually idopathic, which means it just happens. The patients in which it is most common are middle age (around 40-45) and usually female. It it known that certain things exacerbate the symptoms. This includes improper positioning of the wrists, static grasping activities, pregnancy, certain metabolic disorders, and occupations which has a large vibratory component in them. Patients who have had distal radius fractures are known to develop acute traumatic carpal tunnel syndrome. But, again, in the vast majority of cases, the actual cause is not known. To say that a patient is born with the disorder is one way to describe idopathic. Because, in idopathic cases, the person just develops the disorder for an unknown reason. So, to say that the person was born with it, or was born to develop it, is just as good an explaination as any. If you were diagnosed with an on the job injury, then removal of the offending causes should take care of the problem. If a structural abnormality exists, then surgery may help. The American Society for Surgery of the Hand, states that carpal tunnel releases usually last about 25 years (give or take 10 years). So, patients who have releases done at a young age (under 30) will usually have to have the procedure done again in his/her lifetime. And repeat surgeries, do not do as well as the original procedure in alleviating symptoms. So, for the vast majority of patients, the cause of CTS is not known. And even for those who have a discrete problem, the surgical release does not last forever. One note: For some reason, there is perpetuation of the myth that keyboarding or typing CAUSES carpal tunnel syndrome. While improper wrist positioning may exacerbate an underlying CTS, typing and key boarding do NOT cause CTS. This information has been put out by the ASSH (American Society for Surgery of the Hand) and the Mayo Clinic. The Mayo Clinic has even done research on the topic and has shown that typing does not cause CTS. Many countries and states have dropped CTS as a workman's compensation case in employees who type. Again, for some reason, this myth seems to keep going onward. People just keep repeating what they have heard or read, but never really investigated the topic themselves. The American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) has the position of: ``What causes carpal tunnel syndrome? Usually the cause is unknown. Pressure on the nerve can happen several ways: swelling of the lining of the flexor tendons, called tenosynovitis; joint dislocations, fractures, and arthritis can narrow the tunnel; and keeping the wrist bent for long periods of time. Fluid retention during pregnancy can cause swelling in the tunnel and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which often go away after delivery. Thyroid conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes also can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. There may be a combination of causes. '' The Mayo Clinic has also done research on the subject, from their website: ``Workplace Factors: It 's possible that working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires prolonged or repetitive flexing of the wrist may create harmful pressure on the median nerve, or worsen existing nerve damage. But the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors have n't been established as direct causes of carpal tunnel syndrome. There is little evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome. '' This also: by ASTRID COOK Observer-Reporter Online (06/17/01) ``A study released this week offers some surprising and not-so-surprising insight concerning the infamous repetitive stress disorder, carpal tunnel syndrome. For some time now, nearly everyone assumed the problems associated with carpal tunnel syndrome- pain and numbness in the wrist and hand- were caused by the repetitive action of data entry on a computer keyboard. However, while key strokes and mouse clicks may exacerbate carpal tunnel, researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona have found that computer use does not cause the problem. Doctors long have suspected that carpal tunnel and computers were not related, although common wisdom has put blame on new technology. Thus, the Mayo Clinic findings did not come as a surprise to neurology professionals. '' So, yes, the computer keyboard still gets the rap, but there is no research to show it causes CTS, and the research there is, says is DOES NOT cause CTS. Hope you are doing well. Good luck in the future..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

I do n't want to look fake, but I 'm just too white right now. But this is my question, since I 've never been what kind of questions should I ask when I call or go in. I do n't know anything about it & do n't want to look dumb. Thanks! Kristina######Choose your bed carefully. A couple of things you need to keep in mind about tanning. Do you freckle or burn easily? Do you tan in normal sun? If you answered yes to any of these questions then tanning in a bed is n't for you. Other than that start out the small increments of minutes like 5-10 minutes depending how hot or new the bulbs are. When I tan in a bed it is extremely relaxing to me. So I hope you have a relaxing time. And tell us what your experience turned out to be. ------------------ Some people see things as they are and saywhy. I dream things that never were and say why not.######There are three major types of skin cancer. 1. Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). Most common type. Typically occurs in people with extensive exposure to sun or tanning beds over many years. Most people who get it indulged in tanning in their teens and 20's. BCC does n't show up until these people are in their 40's and older. BCC's are not known to spread to internal organs, so fatality rate is low. They do however cause extensive deformity and disfiguration of the effected area. The most common area is the area exposed the most- i.e. the face. Looking good now has a high price tag associated with it if you develop BCC later. 2. Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC). Similar to BCC in appearance and disfiguring qualities. Not as common as BCC, but also appears on areas with most exposure to tanning beds and sun in years past. Unlike BCC, SCC is capable of spreading to internal organs. In the event of internal involvement, fatality rates increase. 3. Malignant Melanoma (MM). Also related to sun and tanning bed exposure, MM is the deadly form of skin cancer. If caught very early, it can be removed from the skin and essentially ``cured '', but the disfiguring effects are much worse than with BCC and SCC, because huge margins of helathy skin are removed in an attempt to ensure no malignant cells remain in the body. Melanoma can and does spread rapidly through the body if not caught early. Most common internal sites are liver, lungs, and brain. MM does not respond well to chemotherapy, radiation, or any other known cancer treatments. Fatality rates are extremely high (95% or higher) for patients with internal involvement. PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE PURPOSELY EXPOSING YOURSELF TO TANNING BEDS AND THE SUN. Sorry if I sound preachy. But I 've lost a loved one to MM and it is NOT a graceful way to die. Visit (url = ``http://www.mpip.org '' ]www.mpip.org (/ url) for a wake-up call. Melanie (This message has been edited by MelanieB (edited 03-12-2002) .)######Why is a tanning bed not for people that tan in the sun? Just curious######Trinket I do n't understand your question... huh? Tanning beds give off radiation. The sun gives off radiation. BOTH are bad for your skin. There is no such thing as a ``Healthy Tan ''. When you skin tans, it 's your body's mechanism of attempting to protect itself from the radiation. Melanocytes develop on the skin, which turn it brown. Melanocytes are the cells in your skin that carry and cause pigment. Melanocytes are also the cells that become malignant when you have Malignant Melanoma. So if you do n't aggravate your melanocytes, you have a better chance of preventing them from becoming malignant. That 's not the ``scientific '' definition (I 'm really generalizing) but that 's how it is, in plain english. Melanie.######-General###-Open to All Other Health Topics

Has anyone tried this and if so what happened?######that is one of the ingredients in the black salve I used to remove my skin cancer.######I have never tried it, but I know people who have-- and yes, it does remove skin cancers. If you do n't know what you 're doing, though, you can make a mess. I would try it with a simple BCC on my back or leg, but I 'd never try it on my face unless supervised.######I have used it. It works but it does cause a lot of pain. Additionally depending on where and how large the cancer is, it can be quite scary during the process of killing the tumor and healing. From my personal experience I would compare typical Actenic Keratosis (ACK's) and Basal cell carcinomas (BCC's) as similar to an iceberg, a small portion on top then pyramiding out below the skin. What I 'm saying is if you have a 1/8 '' sore visible, it coulb be a 1/2 '' or more below. When you treat with these paste you can also discover cancers you did n't know you had... Yikes! I 've had lab confirmed BCC's removed by a dermatologist that came reoccured and then removed them with the bloodroot paste and have them reoccur. . neither method is a 100% guarantee. For instance I had a documented BCC removed from my forehead via the knife... 2 years later it was back with a vengance. I treated it with the paste and several other smaller ones all at one time (not recommended because of the pain) It knocked out several small ones. All but one of which now after 5 years seems permanently gone. The persistent one came back after @ 1 1/2 years... not as big but back. This time I did 2 applications over 2 days. Double yikes !!!! on the pain and OMG! when I removed the bandage. Clearly there was a lot more cancer and precancer going on in the general area than I had realized. Scared the double hockey sticks out of me and I swelled up like Quasimoto. A month later I was relatively healed up and I have a pretty nice scar. I have to think that if I had let this cancer into the hands of a dermatologist using Mohs (which is effective but IMO over invasive), I am certain they would have removed a good 8 square inches of forehead. This would have required a major skin graft and very unpredictable visual results. It has been about 1 year and the scarring is going away and it appears I have kicked the BCC's butt. I am now treating several new ones in other regions on my face, scalp and neck with my own dilluted version of the bloodroot paste. Instead of giving it the one or 2 time super blast of the very reactive paste, I 'm giving it a milder multiple treatment. It appears to be having the same attack effect just not so fast or intense and the cancers are slowly shrinking and dieing. I 'm in my 2nd week and I 'll keep applying this ``Tincture '' until I do n't get a reaction any more. I apply the tincture, let it set for a few minutes then dilute the area with aloe vera gel. I then use some antibiotic ointment and cover the area with a bandage. I repeat each morning after I shower with the bandages off. As far as scaring I know letting the wounds get wet is not the best way to handle them but it helps remove the dead tissue before I reapply so that 's what I 'm doing. (removed) The skin cancer on my right forehead was the one that was clinically indentified as a BCC and was surgically removed and came back. The others were unofficialy determined to also be BCC's by the same dermatologist but with out the pathology report ca n't be officialy called BCC's (I 'm 99.99% certain they all were) Last but not least... I ca n't express strongly enough that this stuff hurts when you use it. . but so does surgical removal and stitches. I think for the sake of knowing, you should see a dermatologist to make sure it is not melanoma (but then again there are plenty of testimonials claiming success over melanoma tumors with bloodroot past too) Once identified get some of the paste from one of the online suppliers and before you try it on the known tumor, try it on an area of skin that you are sure is clean. I did a test area on my inside of my arm (the side that does n't get sun) I placed a dab on my arm and covered it with a bandaid for 24 hours. Nothing happened... but a slight pinking that went away within an hour. This test is mainly to show you first hand that this paste will not effect ``normal tissue '' only sick unhealthy tissue reacts. On the contrary when I put it on an area with cancer. . within seconds the doo doo hits the fan and you know something is happening. To all of you looking for a alternative solution do your own due dilligence. G-o-o-g-l-e (Healthboards is censoring that search engine name?) your butt off for a few days seaching terms like Bloodroot paste, Black salve. . you can combine them with words like skin cancer and Cure etc. e.g. ``Skin Cancer '' ``Blood root paste '' putting words in quotes gets more refined results. Educate yourself on the origin of these paste and how our American Indians, ancient healers and Dr. Mohs used them to win the battle of skin cancer... The FDA and the AMA in their quest to help sometimes do the exact opposite. I do n't believe there is a medical conspiracy just a bueracracy that is out of control. In the process this is causing a lot of people unecessary pain and suffering and denying ``We the people '' the right to try alternative treatments on our own choices and accord. Again this paste is not the be all end all but IMO works as well or better than anything else available. before I ever touched the stuff I hunted down several people that had actually used it. I spoke to thm personally. After speaking to so many relieved people I went for well informed beforehand and ended up with satisfactory results and no surprises. Good Luck!######I have never heard of this paste before and did a search on it. Is this good to use on any mole to get rid of. That sure would be better then removing them sugically. Does it cause a burning sensation when applied?######I have never used it, but this product must be like an acid that eats away at the living cancer tissue. Since we have nerve endings in this tissue, it must be very painful as it is dissolved by the acid paste.######Once again, did you diagnosis yourself as having BCC, or did the dermatologist do a biopsy and determined that it was BCC? Then once the dermatologist's results said that you have BCC, you decided to treat it yourself?######I can not believe for one minute that bloodroot paste (or any other paste) will `remove ' malignant melanoma. Since I have that. The only way to be totally one hundred percent sure it is a MM is to have it totally excised (and really that does not hurt!) They then can do the correct staging and all the information needed to acurately stage this disease as in any other major cancers. Remember Melanoma is NOT JUST A SKIN CANCER and seeing posts like this does in fact get my blood to boiling point. In the past 3 weeks, several people I know through a MM board including that of a 15 year old girl, who has been fighting this disease since she was 11 have passed away. So many deaths. If Blood root paste, or black salve or what ever you are talking about `cures, treats, Malignant melanomas' surely the american and canadian and all the other cancer places not to mention the hospitals that are for cancers only would be jumping at the easy way to save lives... instead of the route we all have to go on. Now maybe the SCC and BCC are treatable, but do not make the statments about MM simply being fixed by applications of salves if only that were true in the cases of MM. I am lucky, I only have to go for CT scans and Xrays and blood works every 3 months, and when a new spot comes up that is suspicious, the dermatologists and the surgical and medical oncologists remove and send it for pathology. So far I have only one primary which was a 4.00 mm thick one, (considered thick) Bonnie######Hello Belle I think some of these posts that you and I are responding to are from infact two years ago, and I hope LONG GONE as it just leads other newbies to the board to have the mess dragged up again. Both you and I know without a proper dx nothing can be done in the way of treatment. and I hope these people do not get the idea of `magic ' elixers that can cure SCC BCC and all the way to Malignant Melanoma (invasive kind) GEE it is like people are surfing and seeing stuff, and not really looking at the dates. I do not know if the orig poster or even the one who posted in April of this year has been back on this board. It does drive me batty I am afraid. Bonnie.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

One thing that I believed helped was the topical chemo treatments that I 've been taking for the past ten plus years. They have three or four different types- a cream or salve that you rub on your skin and it causes fast growing cells (cancer or pre-cancer) to erupt and kill themselves.

It depends on what type of skin cancer it is Melanoma is deadly. Please go today and get it checked.Not all skin cancer is caused by sun exposure######Hi Gobo I have had a lot of experience with Melanoma because my dad had it. He had a very aggressive type. Firstly, you do n't know if you have it and secondly, it might not be anything dangerous. There are a number of things yours could be that are not cancerous- a rodent ulcer for example... There are a number of kinds of Melanomas too in varying severity, some are more aggressive than others and not all are deadly. There are certain criteria that put some of us in a higher risk category than others. Your risks are far better if you have not spent much time in the sun or had extreme, blistering burns in the past, fair skin etc.. The prevalence is far higher in places like Australia, South Africa and other parts of the world where the sun is fierce, though as PP said, not all are caused by sun. It is not easy to identify Melanoma via message boards. Your best bet is to go to a Melanoma specialist who sees tons of such cases a day, since some Melanomas can be tough to diagnose. They really need to look at the area you are concerned with and if they are concerned, send it for a biopsy. Do n't wait on this, early detection can really help. If it is nothing, at least you can put your mind at rest. I hope that you do n't have Melanoma. Please let us know what the outcome is of your doctor's appointment. I will be happy to assist you in any way. Best of luck..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I been going mostly once a week, sometimes once every 10-14 days. On one occasion I went twice in one week which wasn t very smart. I knew there is a risk of skin cancer if you really OVER did it with the tanning and I did not know you can die from it until I read a story about it in the paper. Now I am terrified. I am constantly checking my body for signs of anything. I had a little red bump on my nose yesterday that was so small I had to go up close to the mirror to really notice it, I scraped it off as I thought it was probably a sweat bump but now Im worried that it could be BCC. I am really losing my mind worrying. I stopped tanning all together. I didn t feel like I was abusing my sessions as I tried to spread them out, I was not tanning multiple times a week for a pro long period. I am tan but not really dark and none of the sessions really burned me badly, but from what I understand one session can put you at risk or so. I ve gotten sun burns in the past but I do not have a history of getting consistent sun burns, the last bad sunburn I got was 6 years ago, the last time I tannned at the salon multiple times was 3 years ago. I ve gone years in a row without getting burned, I ve used sun block at the beach the last few years and skin cancer does not run in my family. All things considered about how high is my risk of possibly getting some form of skin cancer? Also, how long would it take to appear? Thanks in advance######I almost totally sure this spot on my nose is either bcc or scc. It fits all the descriptions i 've read and seen on the net. I set an appointment to see my derm on Tuesday. I am really worried.######Hi BigL, If you are worried you are doing the right thing by seeing your derm. My mother had a few scc on her face, my sister had one on her neck. Myself I have had two. Each one looked different. One was a dark spot that would dry out and itch. The other started out like a pimple and just grew bigger and bigger. It is hard to tell so the best thing is to go to the doctor. I was told by a derm that the damage can be done and the skin cancer not show up for 20 years or more. Try not to worry until you find out if it is skin cancer and let us know.######Thanks annie, my sore is very small but it is itching and burning at times. Gets very irritable in a warm room. Im sure it has to be some form of skin cancer. What type of procedure did you get for your scc? Also does getting bcc or scc make you more prone to possibly getting malignant melanoma? That 's what im terrified about. Thanks for the reseponse.######BigL That 's good that your going to the Derm next week. Hopefully that small sore you have is benign. Try not to worry about it till you know for sure. Please keep us updated. Sincerely Nadine######I got back from my appointment. The doctor said the spot on my nose is nothing and gave me a prescription for the itching and burning. He then inspected all the moles on my body and spotted one underneath my right jaw bone that he said he wants to look at. He asked me how long I had it and I said I had no idea, I just discovered it myself this week searching my body for moles. Its not visible if you look at it in the mairror face to face. The doctor then told me to come in for an incision NEXT WEEK. That freaked me out and I asked the doctor is it cancer? He said he doesnt suspect its either of the 3 skin cancers and that I shouldnt be concerned. He thinks it may be an atypical mole. He said it doesnt look very bad but it doesnt look totally fine either so he wants to take a look at it and if he suspects anything he will just cut it out. I was still freaking so I asked him every which way if its cancer and he said he doesnt think so. Then, I know I shouldnt have asked him this, but I did just to gauge his response and asked him if he 's 100 &#37; sure its not cancer and the doctor said he can never say that otherwise there would be no point of having a biopsy. The doctor then went on to say if he though it was serious he would do the incision today, but instead he has me coming back in next week for the incision. Im trying to remain calm but as I did a search for atypical moles they appear to be a potential precursor for melanoma. Thus I am still worried about this and now im thinking to myself if it is melanoma how long has it been there, how about if its been there for months, or a year i could be in deep trouble. sorry to ramble but im just not totally out of the woods yet. Thanks for reading######Hi BigL, The scc on my nose started out like a small pimple and in about three weeks was huge and it just kept on growing. Mine was very agressive and fast. I had it cut out, but the first time the margins came back from the pathologist unclean. They did this three more times. The last time the margins came back clean so they scheduled me for a paramedian forehead flap to repair the hole in the left side of my nose. Two weeks after surgery another scc came up. I have had to have more surgery, radiation and I am still going thru the reconstruction since it metasized into the left side of my face. My case is very rare and my doctor was shocked at how fast it had grown. The other spot was on the right side of my head (next to my eye). It was the one that was slightly raised, brown, and would dry out and itch. I had had this for about a year and when he was doing my forehead flap he noticed it and biopsided it. It also came back as scc. He cut it out, the margins came back clean and I have not had any problems in that area since. As far as your chances of getting melanoma after having an scc or bcc I really do n't know. I know that this is very scary but just relax until you know what it is. I just trust in God's will and it helps me get thru it all. Good luck with your appointment. Annie######BigL I am glad you went to the dr and found out that the sore is not skin cancer. Try not to worry about the new place the dr found. He will do the incision soon and then you 'll know for sure. Take care, Nadine######Thanks Nadine. What makes me feel a little better is the doctor is doing a biopsy becacuse he thinks its atypical, not cancer but ANYTHING can happen once the test is done I guess. Also like the doctor said, if he thought it was serious he would have done the incision yesterday. Wish me luck. Thanks for responding.######I went for my biopsy yesterday. The head dermotologist at the office took the biopsy. He was not the same doctor who performed the body scan on me. I asked the doctor if he thinks the mole is serious and his opinion was similiar as the other doctor; he said he thinks it 'll be okay. Then after the biospy I asked him if I should be worried and he said ``not for one minute I promise. The mole just looks a little funny. '' That made me feel a little better. Now, I told the head doctor that the only thing the other doctor who performed the body scan on me did not do last week was examine my scalp for any signs. He looked at my whole body but not my head. Maybe since I have rather long, dark thick hair he didnt think it was neccessary. But when i told the head doctor this he seemed a little surprised and asked me ``He took a full body scan but didnt look at your scalp? '' and I told the doctor yea, he didnt go through my hair or anything. The head doctor than told me when i come back next week for my biopsy report he will do a full body scan for me. This has me worried, why does the head doctor now feel the need to do a full scan just becase the other doctor just didnt examine my head? I dont like to put down doctors, but Im now worried that maybe he missed something else on my body or misdiagnose something. I really dont want to have to go through a full body scan again. Now I have to worry for another week and maybe longer or longer if another biopsy is taken next week. As for my scalp, I only got maybe one or two bad sunburn on my head my entire life. It didnt dawn on me that the doctor last week didnt exmaine my scalp until after the appointment. I dont feel any bumps or anything. I just want to be safe. Please wish me luck with my biopsy and 2nd body scan. Im very worried again. Thanks for listening############Blue above lips, not go away, skin cancer worry -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For three months now I have blue in the area above my lip- between lip and nose. Started on the one side, got bigger and now also on other side. Almost look like bruises, but no trauma and not going away. I had many many terrible sunburns as a kid in South-Africa and I am now in my early fourties. After about 6 weeks of noticing it and watching it grow, I made an app. at a derm's office but could only get one for today-this is now 3 months ago. Turns out I see the physicians assistant who looked at it once and said I must have sneezed hard and burst a vein? gave me some cortisone cream and said I can go. I showed her a scaly area o top of my foot that is kind of red and keeps on peeling these huge pieces of skin-to that she said, o, your shoes cause it.I tried about three times to explain toherthatIdo not wear shoes that cover the top of my foot, or hardly ever, she sent someone else back in who said-your shoes cause it, here is some cream. Am I being paranoid- I would much rather they just take a biopsy of the areaabove my lip- I kind of wanted someone who could look me over as I am blonde, very fair skin and who knows- but she hardly stopped to talk. I do not know what to do- can not find anyone that I can see for about another two months. Maybe it is nothing- but is it possible that a burst vein could cause the growing blue on both sides? It does seem to have stopped getting bigger now but not going away. Any response or sharing will be very much appreciated######I 've had four atypical moles removed, none were positive for skin cancer. These are unusual moles that may or may NOT turn into cancer. The safest bet is to get them removed. With these moles doctors ca n't say yes or no to whether they are cancer by looking at them. Most times they come back not cancer. I continue to get more and more so I just have to get checked regularly. Also, do n't panic about using the tanning booth. Yes, it ups your chances, but it does n't guaruntee you 'll ever get it either. Just be diligent about getting skin checks once a year and self-monitoring your skin for new moles or ones that change shape/color and you will be ahead of the game. The biggest key to skin cancer is to catch it early, in which case it 's almost always cureable.######My Biopsy report came back good. The mole is not cancer. The doctor said I need to get periodic checkups because I may be more at risk to get it though. Thanks all.######The most important thing you can do is relax as the stress will get you before any skin cancer turns up. I do n't understand why you were freaking out when the 2nd dermatologist said you 'd need a scalp exam, as he only said he 'd do one because you made such a big deal of it in the first place. Seriously, try to relax and do n't worry about things that have n't happened otherwise you 'll ruin the best years of your life. Worry about dying when you 're actually dying, not before.######Try to just keep things in perspective. The fact that you tanned does NOT mean you will get skin cancer/melanoma. Even an atypical mole does NOT mean that it will eventually turn to cancer. Just continue to be diligent with your own self exams and note anything suspicious and keep an eye on it if your find something. The main thing to note is changes in appearance, shape, size, etc.. . Skin cancer is scary- there is no doubt about that. But relax- the time you spent tanning can not be reversed- it can only be controlled now. And you are doing that by being aware and watching your skin. I am glad to hear that your mole is clear. That is good news. Wishing you the best..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

It 's hard, and has n't changed in size very much (smaller than a pencil eraser), and looks translucent. When I first noticed it I thought it was a pimple and tried to pop it. It scabbed over, then turned pink again. Sometimes it almost looks like there 's a little white pimple on it, but that disappears and reappears randomly. Of course I 'm worried that this is some form of skin cancer, and I have an appointment with a dermatologist set up for after the holidays. Also, in the past few weeks I 've noticed a similar place on my scalp above my ear. It is covered by my hair, and when I first noticed it I thought it was a bump. It seems to have increased in size a bit. It is pink and slightly raised. I 'm posting this to see if anyone out there has seen anything similar to these, and could give me advice. I 'm really stressing myself out with worry that it 's the worst. Thanks for any input!######Sorry that you have to be so worried about this during a busy time of the year. But it is good that you are having it looked at. It could be any number of things. Could be some kind of benign skin growth (there are all kinds of those), or it could be basal cell carcinoma (still not horrible, curable with treatment). I know worry and worry myself silly over these darned moles and growths. But I 've encountered quite a few things that were not cancer to calm me somewhat. I always thought any wierd thing on my skin automatically meant melanoma. But from experience there are so many odd skin growths and spots that it is most likely not melanoma. Keep your appointment and try not to obsess about it too much. Melanoma, though on the rise, is still pretty rare. So try to keep that in mind. Take care!######Thank you, irisrose, for your words of encouragement. I 'll try to take them to heart. I 've spent alot of time on the Internet reading descriptions and looking at all the pictures, and I think it 's making me feel sicker. There is so much conflicting information, and these lumps look like they could be a match for basal cell carcinoma or nodular melanoma. I 've never had any moles or growths on my body, so I do n't have anything to compare these to. And I know I should n't be trying to self-diagnose, but while I am waiting to get to the doctor, I 'm obsessing over it, imagining the worst. Thanks again for your encouragement, and Merry Christmas.######Just as a follow-up, I saw my dermatologist and he biopsied the nodule on my arm. Turns out it was a dermatofibroma, totally benign. All that worry over nothing, but good news in the end. Good health to all.######That is great news! I am very happy for you! Now that you are a bit more familiar about skin cancer and skin care, it would be a great idea to add `an anual visit to the dermatologist ' to every annual check ups that you have. If teeth clean ups, physical exams, hair cuts, eye exams... all these other body parts get so much attention, it would be nice to add skin check ups to the list. If anything it will give you peace of mind Just a thought.######It 's already on my list. Thanks for the well wishes, Trish!.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I grew up in Southern California on the beach. I love the sun and sunshine. I found when I moved here to the South I missed that bright light sunshine. We never seem to get it here. I am also NOT used to Winter. I found a tanning bed made me feel better. Fortunately I only went a few times. It is really really really popular here in the South to have a fake tan. So many of the young kids go. My kids know better and have all the facts.... I have a skin disease called Bowen's that is aggravated by the sun and caused from drinking water with Arsenic it it when I was a child. I have had numerous Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Basal Cell Carcinomas. I have had a Vaginal SCC which can be very very aggressive. I also have Melonoma in my family with my Brother and Father. I am looked over monthly at MD Anderson. I think Tanning beds should be banned. How I miss my legs looking tan but I would rather stay alive. I do not like those fake tan creams which are probably not good for you either. Remember our skin is our largest organ and we absorb everything we put onto it. Be aware what you put on your skin.

Thanks######There are several conditions that can mimic skin cancer. These conditions are benign lesions and are much more common than skin cancers. A fibrous papule, flesh colored papule that usually appears on or around the nose, but can be found on other parts of the face, too, can mimic basal cell carcinoma. Seborrheic keratosis is very common growth, related to age (appears after 30's) and can be confused with moles. This lesion can change color, size, shape very quickly and thats why mimic melanoma (the most malignant skin cancer). Solar lentigoes or sun spots, also mimic melanoma and they are found on the most sun exposed areas of the body. Moles and skin tags can mimic skin cancer, too. Also, a differential problem can be caused by some skin infections, granuloms and ulcers. Hope I helped!.######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

MS.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis######For a long time now I have been experiencing some bizarre symptoms. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia officially 8 years back but the last 3 years there have been some concerns that I actually have MS. 2 of my friends have MS and when we sit and talk they say they are very shocked that I am as yet undiagnosed. I am under the Neuro team for this and had an MRI and CSF test back at the start of the year. All came back OK but the symptoms remained. The worst being the loss of feeling in my legs and private area. I twitch badly, have vision issues, double vision mainly but my peripheral is going as well, I get tinitus, memory issues, fall over, walk in the opposite direction to what I actually need to go. . and many more things. Is there the chance that I do have it but the markers are yet to appear?######With normal testing (MRI & CSF) then no, it probably is n't MS but it is always possible for MS to show up later on... hard to know. Fibromyalgia has symptoms other than pain. Fibromyalgia can cause memory problems, sometimes referred to as Fibro-fog. Fibromyalgia can co-exist with other conditions such as Lupus, Restless Leg Syndrome or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. You may want to discuss your Fibromyalgia and other conditions that can co-exist with it with your doctor- You may find answers for symptoms by taking that direction. The only vision problem related to MS is Optic Neuritis. An opthamologist would be able to tell you if you have Optic Neuritis. If the answer is no then you vision problems would not be MS related. Optic Neuritis is inflamation of the Optic Nerve. If the Optic Nerve is inflamed it would be visible on a MRI. Since there can be several causes for your vision problems you may want to see an Opthamologist for an evaluation######I have quite a few of the fibro issues but because they mimic MS it is hard to know what is happening but I have been assured by my doctors (both hopsital and GP) that losing control of my bladder and the numbness in my private area is not related to the Fibro as this is not one of the symptoms..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

'' this theory states that people with fibromyalgia have a lower threshold for pain because of increased sensitivity in the brain to pain signals, so that pressure on a spot on the body that would n't hurt someone without fibromyalgia can be very painful to someone who has the condition. does this mean that in addition to the regular symptoms of fibro, if you become ill or injured, it hurts a lot more than the average person? for the past three years, i often feel too weak to get out of bed, and my back and knees and head hurt. i am prone to throat and bladder infections. however on more than one occasion i have been told i have a pain tolerance. so does this mean i definitely have fibromyalgia? also, do all of you with it have the minimum 11 tender locations specified by the american college of rheumatology? how much can symptoms differ? do you ever feel better? thank you.######One thing you should know first is that every case of Fibro varies. One person might have all of the tender point and just experience overall pain, and another person might fall short of the required tender points and mainly feel pain in their lower body. It all depends on the person. The most current things I have read on FMS talk a lot about the central nervous system and how it has basically gone amuck. My rheumy said that fibro sufferers brain scans actually differ from healthy people. Certain parts of the brain are more sensitive/more active than they should be. The other arguement is that it is an immune dysfunction. Some believe that people with FMS have disturbed immune systems and the concentration should not be on giving pain meds, but on getting the immune system healthy. Sickness can trigger FMS. If you have had a major illness, accident, emotional stress, etc in your life coinsiding with the onset of your symptoms, then it is very possible that you have FMS. FMS sufferers do n't have a low pain threshold, or maybe I just do n't like the way that sounds. Our nervous systems are just oversensitive to many different things. I believe that women naturally have a high pain tolenance... I mean we are designed to give birth (and that 's no walk in the park). From personal experience, I heal more slowly after surgery. I take longer to recover. I often have complications (not life threatening or anything like that), but on at least one occassion every doctor I have seen has been a little puzzled by what my body does. I hope this helped a little. If someone sees something in here that is wrong or can explain it better, then please correct me. I do n't want to add more confusion to a person who is already confused.######Hi sweetheart. I know this is difficult for you and I send huggies and love your way. There are several ways FMS can be triggered, but you have had this condition since birth. When you become very ill or injured your body is taxed beyond its ability to heal normally and FMS rears its ugly head. If you become injured while your body has finally succumbed to FMS, it can be a difficult road. I 'm not sure how the 11 tender points question will be answered by others. I know that I have been diagnosed with 11, but I know others who have experienced more. Personally, I do not subscribe to the pain threshold theory held by some members of the medical community. As you have found out, this simply does n't make sense. As medical experts grapple for answers, they seem to land in different ``camps '' as to how FMS starts. This pain threshold thing is one of many. I have found the guafenesin protocol is very helpful in obtaining a quality of life and suggest you at least look into this type of therapy. This protocol was developed by Dr. St. Amand and you can read more about it by purchasing his book ``What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Fibromyalgia. '' Dr. St. Amand subscribes to a theory that there is a lack of ATP production in our bodies which creates havoc symptom-wide. This is a very simple explanation of what is acutally a complex series of breakdowns in our bodies because of this issue. Read the book, then decide if this protocol will work for you. You do not have to go see another doctor since you can read the book and follow the instructions (I might add- EXACTLY! - or it wo n't work). You would want to tell your physician what you are doing however. I have been on this therapy for 5 years. I ride my ATV all over the mountains of Colorado, camp, hike, fish, ride my bike, walk my dogs all over the neighborhood, go to the gym. This activity level was simply impossible before I began the therapy. I was almost bedridden. Blessings, Kirstee######i did n't like the sound of that either. i felt it implied that fibromyalgia is more psychological than mental, that people who have it (which are coincidentally mostly women) are just plain weak. it would be great if there was a definitive test to end all of this controversy. i know you mentioned that brain scans may show abnormalities in those suffering from FMS, but good luck getting one of those!######The Dr. Danial Wallace fibro books says fibro sufferers have a high pain Tolerance and a low pain Threshold. What that means is we can tolerate a great deal of pain (good thing... huh!) but we feel pain quicker than someone without fibro. Makes sense to me, I have always had a high tolerance to pain and could pretty much stand anything. Now though when I have procedures done I ca n't get to square one without the pain sending me through the roof. It is very strange. The theory is we have been in so much pain for so long our threshold for pain has lowered in other words we are so tired of being in pain we just ca n't take extra. Someone that is n't in pain on a daily basis can `bolster up ' and stand some pain for a while longer than we can as long as it is short lived. Our tolerance is high because we live in pain everyday and tolerate more pain than most people want to think about. Anyway, I like this explanation better. Glojer######Nikki, I 've just been dx with fibro & I do n't have any of the tender points. It does n't hurt to touch me at all. When I ask my neuro about this he said not everyone has them. He explained that fibro is different for everyone. However, he believes it is an emotional illness. But, he has me on lyrica & it 's working so I 'm staying with him. He was the 4th doctor I had & the 1st to dx & treat me. You asked if it ever went away. Well, only after I got on meds did mine ease up. It 's not gone... but I can function now. I agree with the rest here about pain tolerance. We have to have a high pain tolerance to deal with this daily. Seriously, when a healthy person gets the flu- they are sick & usually stay home in bed until they feel better. Well we ca n't, we have to continue to live & do our best to make it through the day. Try going to a reumie or neuro. They are more likely to help you find your problem, weather it be fibro or something else. Best advice I can give is do n't quit searching. You know you body better than anyone... insist on finding answers. Best of luck, Shelly.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

I 'm 48, and have had a myriad of health issues (most recently a cervical fusion in ' 06), it would take forever to explain it all. For the sake of explanation, two other major events were a possible Guillain Barre episode (during a 10 month battle with Mono) and ataxia due to medication. Anyway, my family doc sent me to a Neuro who did a nerve conduction test on one arm, the typical neuro observations and dx 'd me with Fibromyalgia. I 'll be honest, I think ``fibromyalgia '' is just something the docs came up with when they could n't find answers for other unknown chronic pain issues. This last neuro made me feel like I was a hysterical female (which I am far from being). I believe there truly is a disorder that everyone suffers from, I just think since it 's not life threatening, the docs put finding out the cause on the back burner. I just want to clarify I do n't in any way think anyone here, or with the dx, is having ``hysterical '' pain, quite the opposite, I just have a hard time a disorder being named for the symptom, rather than trying to find out the cause. While I have Chronic pain (some due to the neck fusion), I do n't have the tender points everyone talk about, just the area below the fusion. Actually, you can use a tremendous amount of pressure in my muscles and I barely feel it. My pain is typically a horrific deep ache in my legs mostly, but also my thoracic spine, lower back and sciatica. The sciatica area is the only place you can touch and make me jump, but it requires a lot of pressure to get that reaction. Anyway, I do n't get where this dx comes from. Are n't the trigger points susceptible to horrible pain if touched? Touching does n't bother me at all, the pain is too deep for that. I do have other symptoms that could be fibro, but it could also be MS or a neuropathy. Am I the only fibro patient out there who does n't have trigger point problems ???######Hi, Tender points just above your joints are fibro. Trigger points are in myfascial tissue or muscles. Do a bit of work to find as much information out there as you can. DebeachSiren######Thank you for that explanation. It does seem I have indeed intertwined the two terms out of ignorance. I 'm still confused as I do n't seem to meet the criteria of either, I ca n't imagine why the neuro would give me a diagnosis in that case. Again, please do n't think me disrespectful or minimizing the Fibro sufferers' pain, as I can very personally relate to it. I 'm primarily frustrated that a) I do n't fit the criteria and it seems to be a easy dx for the neuro; and b) My symptoms do point to another disorder (MS), but it seems no one wants to look past the fibro dx. All of my symptoms that, to me, point to MS also seem to point to Fibro, at least that 's what my GP comes up with. Anyway, thank you again for your response.######Hi Cyn, I know what you are talking about. I do n't have a lot of \* trigger points \* either, just a few when the doctor touched them. My pain is more like either it 's hurting all day in that area, or it 's not. Touching it does n't necessarily make it hurt more. I can sympathize with you about the neck, back and sciatica problems. I have that, too, and it 's the worst pain. I can hardly walk and I feel like my back is broken and I 'm 100 yrs. old! I also think I have something more than fibro. I agree they throw the diagnosis at you just to shut you up.######Maybe you have pinched nerves from chronic myofascial pain. I did and after i had trigger point (tender points are different, and i can not find mine, but my rheumy sure can) injections and physical therapy for about 3 years, they have finally gone away. fibromyalgia is real.

Just so you know. There is something worse than fibromyalgia (sory I dont ' like to call it fibro). Me, they diagnosed with fibromyaliga but without ANY tender points so I dont ' know what I have but i know I have pain all over the muslces of my body. BUT try Chronic neck pain ----- People that is WORSE so much worse. If I had to choose fibromyalgia or chronic neck pain 24 hours a day I will choose fibromyalgia. At least you can more or less cope with it. Neck has nerve intersection and any little problem like Whiplash can hurt the soft tissue for life even if it 's only muscle pain. It 's INCURABLE. All those doctors are for only prescribing pain killers but not cure soft tissue damage. For years this whiplash been around and they can not do anything about it. The hell with those cars. You just need sleeping pills all the time with neck pain cause you can not rest your neck on the pillow. In one moment your life can change. So bless your luck, you could have fibromyalgia and chronic neck pain and no sleep at all.######Hugs to you. Sounds like you are having a rough time at the moment. Believe me I KNOW what it 's like to live with chronic neck pain as well as fibro etc etc...######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

A friend of mine suggested with the symptoms i have i may have Fibromyalgia. Are there any particular tests the doctor can do to see if this may be my problem? Many thanks######Hi Sherry! You are so welcome here. You should see a rheumatologist. This doctor will do an elimination of other problems before diagnosing FMS. He/She will also perform a tender point test, of which there are 18 different points in the body where pain manifests in FMS patients. He or she will also ask questions about IBS, CFS, fibrofog, etc., in order to assist in the diagnosis. At this time, there are no clinical labs that can pinpoint FMS. Bye! Kirstee######The first thing they 'll do is a complete blood workup, any tests that can rule out other possible diseases/conditions. I had four by the time I was diagnosed. Then the rheumatologist will do a tender point test if everything else has been ruled out and your symptoms have lasted for a certain length of time, but the tender point test really is n't accurate. It could easily diagnose you, sure, but a lot of people get misdiagnosed that way, so just be sure you 've exhausted EVERY possibility before accepting that diagnosis. I 've heard of people who thought they had FM and were treating their FM, only to find out they had Lyme's, and by then it was too late for them to really do much about it..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

I have leg pain and EMG resluts. All this points to neuro problem. I never had all the tender points except in the front of the shin and shoulders. I do n't have the depression or fatigue. Lately I am getting the trigger points all over and increased fatigue. The fatigue might be asthma and allergy related. I have migraines too. IBS. I wonder if all the pain I have been on has triggered this. However, all exercise makes me worse, NSAIDs do nothing, anti-depressants give me headaches and make me crazy. All that helps is MS Contin, neurontin and muscle relaxers. I was sure I did n't fit in this group before, but as the muscle pain spreads, I begin to wonder. I had though of it myself, before pain doctor said it. I do fear that fibro is over diagnosed. I know you guys are going through something real. Something that many do n't take seriously. Wondered if any of you had any thoughts. Everyone else thought my problems were spinal or may be (not likely) auto-immune. I have had many diagnoses before. Confused.######There 's a variety of ways people believe causes fibro. It sounds as though you may have found one of them. Since those symptoms are just beginning, hopefully it is the stress from the pain and lack of sleep. The sleep part is just a guess. The longer the stresser is in charge, the more likely is is to become chronic. Anyway, that is my opinion. Perhaps someone will have suggestions for the pain relief. Alice######I am on lots of drugs and have had lots of treatments. And that was when the pain was localized. I ca n't exercise, cause there is something very wrong with the nerves in my legs. Same goes for my arms cause the discs in my neck are seriously damaged. I am sleeping. With medication. Otherwise I wake up in pain. I do n't feel exhausted or depressed. I do have the trigger points and they are spreding beyond the areas that are alreayd a problem. I am realy disabled. I ca n't walk much. My husband had to take care of me, shops, does everything. This is before it turned into fibro or the monster spread. Other possiblity is spinal cord impingement. Some shows on MRIs not enough. We all know how accurate those tests are. I do have a very kind pain doctor and before this one a kind set of rehabilitative doctors and rheums. All trying to help, but I get worse. Oh well. I wondered if this really sounded like fibro or just myfacial pain. Somethings in common with fibro but not true fibro.######Hey Jane, I agree that fibromyalgia is over diagnosed. . Sometimes it 's just a scapegoat when doctors ca n't find a true cause for a patient's suffering. . However, a lot of research links fibro to problems with the nervous system. . My rheumatologist personally believes that it 's caused by the overactivity of neurotransmitters in the brain, but there really is n't much medical consensus when it comes to fibromyalgia because there just has n't been enough research done. . For every study done about fibro, there is another one that refutes its findings. . Fibromyalgia is technically a syndrome (or a set of symptoms) that can coexist with other conditions. . If your body has been ``out of whack '' long enough, it might very well lead to fibromyalgia or a physical state that resembles fibromyalgia. . That 's why a lot of cases of fibro are linked to autoimmune disorders, viruses, intense physical or emotional trauma and other medical distress. . I personallly believe that if your body and brain have to overcompensate due to physical or emotional distress over a long period of time, they eventually just get stuck in overcompensation mode. . Of course, those are just theories and speculation. . I know that there is a relationship between fibromyalgia and chronic myofascial pain too, but I have n't done enough research on the matter to discuss it intelligently. . In any event, not every fibromyalgia sufferer experiences all fibromyalgia symptoms. . Yes, they generally have the tender points, but a doctor could pick just about any point on my body to press and it would hurt. . My most common symptoms are pain, fatigue, anxiety, dizziness/lightheadedness, sensitivity to light, sound & touch and a general feeling of illness. . Everyone of us is different though. . Some have depression, some do n't. . Others have IBS, while some are IBS free. . I honestly do n't know whether or not it matters if you have fibro. . You 're already getting treated for your symptoms & I 'm not sure that a diagnosis of fibro would change anything (except your doctor's willingness to look into medical maladies and find the true root of your problem because EVERYTHING can be blamed on fibro). . Anyway, I 've rambled for long enough. . I wish I could help more, but most of the time, I 'm just as confused as you are. . Take Care, Melanie######I can relate to some of what you said. I have cervical spine injuries from a motorcycle accident last July. I had the wreck the last of July but did n't have big symptoms until Sept.. I am a nurse and had to quit working Dec. because of inablility to lift pts and horrible pain. My family doc and my chiropractor have diagnoised me with fibromyalgia. I am currently being tested for MS. If these test are negative, I will go to a rheumie. I really got desperate for pain relief before I agreed to go to a chiropractor. I wish I had done it along time ago. My chiropractor specializes in active muscle release. He has helped tremendously. I was on 1800mg of neurontin daily, now I take only 300mg at bedtime.

The beginning of March, I could n't even hold my body up in the water. I started out by just standing in the pool, then gradually I became stronger. I can now swim about 18 laps. Also, I walk 2 miles a day. What I have found is that low to moderate exercise helps but I can no longer push it to enter the competitive phase. If I do n't exercise at all, I get worse.

I was diagnosed with chronic myofascial pain about 2 years ago. The neurologist who diagnosed me said it is different from fibromyalgia although symptoms may be similar but (this is where it gets confusing) my family doctor says they are the same thing pretty much. Oh yeah the neurologist also said cmp can be proven because of having trigger points but fibro ca n't ?? When I type in myofascial pain in a search engine most of the info is about fibro. So are they essentially the same ??######I 'm not too sure myself. I know that last year I was dx 'd w/ cmps because I was still doubting fibro. So, my family dr then said I had cmps. My psychologist used to be a pain mgt dr. She told me a few wks ago that fibro and cmps go together. It 's basically the same things. I personally do n't think the trigger point test for fibro will be around to much longer. Some dr's press hard, some do n't press hard enough. Some people one day might have 11 pain spots, and then the next time maybe have only 8 bugging them. Very confusing !! I think the hard muscle knots that we get from fibro are causing the myofacial pain also. But, I honestly do n't know.######Somewhere else in this Forum, I have described Myofascial Pain Syndrome: Soft tissue damage may trigger pain. Tight muscles that are painful to the touch. Aches and pains that limit your ability to walk, move your arm or hand, or even open your mouth. These symptoms are warning signs that your soft tissue-muscles, tendons, and ligaments-may be damaged. Damaged soft tissue can lead to myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), a common but complex problem in which muscles develop painful ``knots '' called trigger points. 1) Soft tissue is torn; 2) trigger points form (as torn tissue heals, underlying fibers contract and become twisted. New tissue grows over the knotted fibers, making the area feel bumpy. This hard, bumpy area is called a trigger point because pressing on it triggers pain right there or elsewhere in the body.) ; and 3) Muscle shortens, resulting in decreased mobility. So, you can have MFS and not have Fibromyalgia. Do n't confuse ``trigger points '' with ``tender points '' found in FMS. The International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems that went into effect on January 1, 1993 specifically states the diagnosis for Fibromyalgia. This document defines FMS as a painful nonarticular condition predominately involving muscles and the most common cause of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain. Tender points being the most powerful discriminator between FMS and controls. Then, there are the numerous other symptoms found in fibromyalgia that have nothing to do with myofascial pain syndrome. I understand your confusion. Sounds like your doctor is a bit confused also. LOL Hope this helps.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

The symptoms (in some cases) can be controlled with exercise, massage, and medications but never go away completely. Usually a rheumatologist will diagnose fibromyalgia after negative blood tests for other rhumatic diseases such as Lupus or RA and they also offer anti-depressants for fibromyalgia (their effectiveness is about 50%) and recommend exercise and massage. Perhaps you could be referred to a rheumatologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and more information specific to you.######Thanks! I thought the same thing too thats why I looked at the doctor when he said he might go away. I have been in pain and have bad burning sensations all in my neck, back, shoulder, and legs. I know sleep apnea can cause fibromyalgia too I was just curious if this medicine would help?######It sounds like you need more testing to determine if you really have Fibro. A Rheumy would be good to make sure. And Fibro does not go away but can be managed. Your doctor was correct in treating your sleep apnea, as that is very important to health and well being. And if you really do have Fibro, good sleep is very important as it will give you more energy and less pain.######Hi, i was diagnosed by my rhumy with fybro last July after lupus test was neg.

If Fibromyalgia is reconfirmed, then consider getting started on newer therapies for its control. It usually affects women in age group of 30-50 years. Multiple approach is necessary for treatment that includes medications, exercises, and diet changes. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also known to help people who do not easily get relief with the medications. Ongoing researches have been directed towards better pain relief. You can discuss about getting started on trial medications to see if they benefit you. Take care..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Fibromyalgia

The second doctor diagnosed it as Bursitis. I told my doctor about it and he said that Bursitis does n't cause the legs to go dead. My mom is scheduled for an appointment with the second doctor in about another week. If he still insists that it is Bursitis, she said that she is going to go to my doctor.

Thanks, Teri######Teri, If she only has pain in her back through legs then it does n't sound like FMS. Maybe a back (spine) problem from the symtoms you have said.

I think I have had just about every test there is ----- all normal I just went to a rheumatologist and he suggested possibly oesto arthritis, bursitis, and/or Fibromyalgia and also put me on flexeril and mobic took blood to look for inflammation, xrays of hands, and to see him in two weeks. I am struggling to reconcile the fibromyalgia because the only muscle type pain I have is in my neck, I am not tired and I can exercise and not have muscle pain afterwards. My mom has fibromyalgia and says that she feels like she has been hit by a truck when she has a flare. So can anyone with fibromyalgia tell me if they experience these joint type pains with out all of the other symptoms?######hi, not me. i opted for the full package. your mom is right about the truck. at least it was mentioned as a possible, does not mean you have it but good the doc is including it as you both search for the answer. i really hope you do not have fibro. it is not an easy path. peace, bluelakelady######Thanks BlueLakeLady, I really hope I do n't have it too. I have seen my mom suffer so much. I think I am just panicked at the thought. You are right the Dr is a good Dr I think.######hi, it 's easy to freak when you hear the word fibro. especially since you know about it from your dear mom. hug her for me. take a deep breath and relax. what is, already is, now is the time for finding answers so you know what to do next and make your plan. all the worry in the world changes nothing. just wears you out. i know it 's hard not to think about it but do your best to fill your time with things that please you and take your mind off the next visit. peace, bluelakelady######I was tested for fibromyalgia with the tender point exam, and an MRI of my brain to rule out MS. I had flares like your mom's and still do but not as often. When I flare it feels like I have the flu-- achey and weak. My mom has fibromyalgia and so did my grandma. The one thing that helped me at the beginning more than anything was the book ``Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain '' by Devin Starlanyl. She explains that FMS is a central nervous system disorder-- feeling pain when there is not reason to feel pain. I suggest getting a different rheumatologist that will test and treat you for fms. I was diagnosed by my PCP and a neurologist and Pain mgmt doc and rheumy. Most of my treatment is with my pain mgmt doc. I have CMP- chronic myofascial pain and she treats that and orders my pain meds for that and fibro. (Pain meds are not always needed.) Just because your mom has severe symptoms, does n't mean that you will. Try not to stress out. I hope you feel better soon..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

Just so you know. There is something worse than fibromyalgia (sory I dont ' like to call it fibro). Me, they diagnosed with fibromyaliga but without ANY tender points so I dont ' know what I have but i know I have pain all over the muslces of my body. BUT try Chronic neck pain ----- People that is WORSE so much worse. If I had to choose fibromyalgia or chronic neck pain 24 hours a day I will choose fibromyalgia. At least you can more or less cope with it. Neck has nerve intersection and any little problem like Whiplash can hurt the soft tissue for life even if it 's only muscle pain. It 's INCURABLE. All those doctors are for only prescribing pain killers but not cure soft tissue damage. For years this whiplash been around and they can not do anything about it. The hell with those cars. You just need sleeping pills all the time with neck pain cause you can not rest your neck on the pillow. In one moment your life can change. So bless your luck, you could have fibromyalgia and chronic neck pain and no sleep at all.######Hugs to you. Sounds like you are having a rough time at the moment.

Does it start out as something small and then gets bigger? I just need lots of info and fast. Thanks Suzie######Sometimes it is hard to diagnose asthma in children, what to look for: a cough that seems to last for a long time, sometimes it is after a cold and hard to distinguish, shortness of breath, more coughing at night, wheezing. If your child has allergies there is a greater chance for asthma. The coughing will be hard to describe but it is like a series of coughs, either in the night or day, especially if exposed to allergens. If your child is over 5 there is a test that can be given to see if they have asthma, your best bet would be to go to the doctor. Not everyone's asthma is the same. I was not diagnosed until I was an adult, the doctor was surprised that I had never been diagnosed. Well... it never crossed my mind that I has asthma, I just thought every few months I would get a chest cold that would last for a very long time. I knew about my allergies but never put 2 and 2 together until I had a full blown attack and ended up in the hospital. Again, when in doubt, go see the doctor. You can also do a search of asthma symptoms and see if your child has them.######What symptoms is your 6 year old having?######Well, when she was younger she was always getting coughs after colds that lasted too long. She would get croup just out of the blue at night and have trouble catching her breath. all I would do is, well sometimes I panicked but I got her into the bathroom and put the shower on and just sat in there with her until she was better. The weird thing is was that she never had any symptoms she would just wake up like that. I would take her to the doctor and they would just say it was a cold or allergies which she has. They would always ask me if she had asthma and I would say I do n't think so but that 's all they would do. None of the over the counter meds worked on her for colds or allergies. So, which brings me to today, now remember she has had the colds or coughs and I would take her into the docs office and they always asked me if she had asthma. Anyway, she started with a cough and nothing else no symptoms what so ever, it 's been 3 weeks now and it 's basically sounds awful like there is a lot of phlem (sp?) I 'm just tired of the doctors asking me if she has it, like i would know. I start to think '' I do n't know you tell me if she has it '' that 's what I think when the doctors ask me. Anyway, please someone help me here. I know everyone reads these but not everyone responds. Why ?? I do n't mean to sound rude it 's just that I 'm worried about my baby and I do n't want her to end up having a bad attack and we do n't know anything about asthma. Thanks for listening. Suzie######Sounds like a very real possibility to me. Take her to the doctor when she is well and straight-out ask about the possibility of it. If he dodges you, ask for a referral to a board-certified allergist. These allergist know myriads about asthma. They are not as good as a pulmonologist, but at least they can help and they can identify triggers like allergies. I would also start asking for pulmonary functions testing.######Mom, you can look up tons of sites here on asthma, but the only way to know is to take her to the doctor, if that does n't work, try another doctor. No one can predict when a bad asthma attack will occur, but if you suspect it, go to a doctor and have them confirm it and put her on medications to prevent an all out attack.######Your situation sounds somewhat similar to mine. Last year my 6 yr. old got a cold and he coughed and coughed nonstop. I took him in twice to have his chest listened to and the dr. said it sounded good. The cough finally went away but he was left with a croupy loud barky sounding cough that occurred usually a few times in the morning and always when he first went outside in the cold winter. So after about 8 weeks of this sporadic barky cough, he started getting another cold so I took him again. This time the dr. heard wheezing said he had asthma and gave prednisone, flovent, and albuterol. None of this made any difference and he coughed more as what usually happens as a cold progresses. A week or so later he was coughing so much I tried the albuterol and he only stopped coughing for about 10 minutes so I took him to the ER. The dr. there said he had a bit of a wheeze but did n't think it was asthma, called a pediatrician who specializes in asthma who then gave an antibiotic and said come back in 10 days. After the 10 days he told me to stop all the asthma meds, said he did n't know if he has asthma and sent me on my way. That loud short barky cough has continued periodically over the last (almost) year. My family dr. tells me that he does n't have asthma and I say but... he coughs when he goes out in the cold, he has a barky cough... etc.. Dr. says that some kids get croupy with every cold. The pediatrician's main concern was if he ever has trouble breathing and I said not to my knowledge. I did n't even know he was wheezing. So now I watch him like a hawk all the time, I bought a stethoscope and listen for wheezing, and am basically a worried wreck! I do think this is asthma, maybe mild or just starting but something is not right. They have never done any tests and I went to the only asthma guy in the city so I just have to wait and hope this does n't get worse or that he grows out of it. In the meantime, worry, worry, worry.######I would take your child to a dr. if you think so. When my son first got asthma and I was educating myself on it I was shocked w/ how many children have asthma and more than that the statistics on how many children die each year from it. Once diagnosed it will take some time but it 's manageable. I 've also had friends whose kids, during upper respitory infection had very asthma like symptoms but it was an isolated situation. I hope she does n't. Also go here for good basic info: (url = ``http://www.aanma.org/ '') http://www.aanma.org/[/url]... a very informative asthma site dealing esp w/ childrens asthma. (This message has been edited by austin4 (edited 10-09-2003) .) (This message has been edited by austin4 (edited 10-09-2003) .)######I am curious as to what you find out. I also was gon na say that Croup or croup type cough is more of a restriction in the throat area, not usually in the lungs. My son has had croupy cough a few times and his lungs usually sound fine... that is why they ruled out asthma. He is only 5 & just started a croupy cough real bad again last night. My hopes are that it is n't some sign that they will have definate asthma or breathing problems the rest of their lives.######Try running a mile with your nose pluged and breathing threw a cocktail straw. Ask him if it is like that. If he says yes than he has asthma######To all you coughing people out there. Check your water supply. You may be ingesting chlorine tap water. It can make for a nasty long term cough if you are sensitive/ allergic to it. I know, my children experienced 10 months of coughing. Yes, ten months. Severe coughing! So much my 3 year old took hours to fall asleep. The doctors we saw many many times were suggesting they were getting asthma. Gave them asthma drugs antibiotics over an over because the cough would get so bad with congestion and stuff (and wheezing), they would need those drugs or risk worse illness with the lungs. They 'd get a little bit better then they 'd be done with the drugs and the cycle would start all over. Cough Cough Cough. As soon as I stopping letting them drink any water or water jucie combination with any and all chlorine tap water their coughs stopped within a couple days. Why could `nt the doctors have figured it out. I have since researched this information in Libraray medical books on how chlorine can effects humans. Now only colds make them cough. A couple of times over the last nine years they have accidently started using some new source of chlorine tap water (school, friends home etc) and they start coughing again. As soon as the chlorine source is stopped the coughing stops. Check into it, Maybe you or your child or friend does n't really have asthma at all..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

I never had asthma with a child and start wheezing and having chest tightness after exercise. Does this mean I have asthma for life ??######Hello, and thank you for your medical question on e Health Forum. Asthmatic bronchitis occurs as a exaggerated response to environmental stimuli, presenting as breathlessness, audible wheezing and paroxysmal coughing lasting for various duration due to reflex bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the respiratory passages). This disorder can be definitely controlled effectively with medications. Once exposure to the responsible environmental stimulus ceases, the condition resolves itself. The rate of recovery is dependent on each individuals immune system. Exercise induced asthma, is also due to hyper-responsiveness of the respiratory tract to exercise. The remedy in this condition is to use a aerosolized bronchodilator, (prescribed by your health care provider) just before you start your physical exercise. The condition also tends to stabilize with time and proper training. Asthma inducer environmental induced or exercise induced, does stabilize and resolves with time. Once diagnosed it does not mean that a person is asthmatic for life. I hope this helps.######You have a nutritional deficiency. You are not getting enough Essential Fatty Acids in your diet. Essential Fatty acids are needed for healthy respiratory functions. This happens all of the time, If you start taking Essential Fatty acids like omega-3, omega-9 and omega-6 in the optimum amounts, your asthma will begin to go away. You will also need to take what are called the 90 essential nutrients on a daily basis. Look into it for yourself before you get on any medication.######Thanks very much for the reply !!! I am just getting sick every week with respiratory infection, brain fog, fever now, feel better sometimes with bovine raw thyroid (adrenal tissue, thymus, pituitary) Does this mean I am anemic instead of asthmatic or have a gland disease?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Asthma

April######Have they tested her for asthma? The only reason I ask is my 2 year old was recently diagnosed with asthma and her only symptom was a cough that would n't go away. The only other thing I might suspect if she is n't sick is acid reflux. Does she ever complain about her stomach hurting or her throat burning? Sometimes the stomach contents backing up can trigger a cough.######Asthma asthma asthma. It 's exactly what I went through with my daughter... she 's 6 now, and was diagnosed when she was 3, after a year or 2 of a constant dry cough...... and coming down with severe croup several times a year. I was lucky enough to have switched to a doctor that was known for diagnosing ashtma quickly. We only used him for a short time because he just wasnt the right doctor for us for the long term, but i am thankful we at least had him for the short term. There were a lot of questions answered and a lot of solved problems once she was diagnosed. Good Luck.######your child's cough can be caused by many things. one being asthma, it is a fact that asthma does not always produce wheezing, it can produce just a dry cough, this is called CVA (cough variant asthma). i understand that the cough is a dry cough, which would also arise suspicions of croup, or gerd, or post nasal drip. this can also be habit cough, does your child cough at night? have you gotten her tested for asthma? have her seen by an ent and make sure he scopes her, very high possibility of her having gerd, which can easily be treated. a cough is not so easy to diagnose but with the proper doctors and proper tests your child can be on the way to living cough free..######-Family###-Children's Health

These symptoms may confused doctors into thinking you have asthma. I know because it happened to my children. That was 9 years ago. Since my younger much sicker child never did have asthma and stays perfectly well for 9 years with no more coughing and our less sick but still coughing 6 year old when on chlorine tap water did aquire asthma. Since we keep him away from chlorine tap water he remains 100% without symptoms and without wheezing. He also never needs medications unless he comes down with chlorine induced or virus induced problems. Its very possible many of you out there could be less sick needing less medications or maybe not needing any medications at all. Check your water companys. Ask if their water is chlorinated. My kids ca n't be the only humans in the world with this problem. Just as eventually it was well known how dust mites can effect people and how smoke can effect people and the long list of others. Everyone needs to know about chlorine water too. Check into it. It ca n't hurt to try and it does n't even hardly cost anything. I hope all of you can get better soon.######At least one of your kids (as you mentioned one was diagnosed if i 'm wrong i apoolgize) maybe both HAVE asthma i 'm sorry but after reading your posts for months and months its seems clear to me the viruses and chlorine are two of their triggers for this disease. If they only have two they are lucky some of us have dozens and just to keep things interesting they change every now and then with new ones popping up. Now all of you have two choices you can control the asthma or you can let the asthma control you. what to do- avoid everything that triggers the asthma, or treat the disease? you seem to advocating avoidance for just chlorine you 'd have to aviod all swimming pools, swim teams, swim lessons always all the time and all public water not as easy as it sounds having to pack your own on vacations (remember not to book a hotel with a pool the kids will want to go and they ca n't), around town and at school and viruses ummm live in a big bubble? or become a hermit? I dunno how to manage that one I 'll admit SO more triggers pop up so you avoid more and live less and do less Asthma is in control (i know this i 've tried to live that way) OR you can control the asthma with meds (certainly lower dosages then when the uncontrolled asthma suffers a major attack when you did n't manage to avoid a trigger or a new trigger pops up) When asthma is properly control almost all asthmatics can do what they want when they want and lead a normal life. I say life is to be lived not avoided !!! Momof2######It probably seems odd but pools do not make them cough. It 's the drinking of chlorine tap water that effects my two children. As far as getting chlorine free water on vaction... not a problem. Stores have gallon bottled water near any vacation spot unless of course one was inclined to go somewhere remote. In Mexico it 's a priority to get fresh bottled water to drink. Or not drink water at all. Luckily our kids problems with their coughs are not extreme asthma cases as some must suffer with every day of their lives. Altho they would of been extremely ill or on 24 hour medication over the last nine years if I had not figured out the chlorine problem. My goal to inform as many people as I can about what happened to our family just in case there is someone out there that could be helped. For many, of course, this information will not be able to help. Daily medications will be needed for their whole lives. I wish someone had helped us. My kids had to suffer a long time before I finally figured it out. It seems so silly now to think their doctors wanted us to damp mop every surface in their rooms several times per week to cut out dust and remove all their stuffed toys to do the same... SHEESH what a lot of work... and to think all I had to do was switch them to bottled water for drinking and their juice etc.. A WHOLE lot easier. Good luck to you all...######To momonline: Have you checked just to see if you are drinking chlorine tap water? Or is your water chlorine free? If you are maybe, just maybe you would be less sick if you stopped drinking chlorine tap water. Just like my kids got better. Now if I could just figure out why my nose is always runny.######haar i drink filtered water bc it tastes better. it does n't matter though chlorine is not one of my triggers- whether avioding triggers or not them asthmatics stil have the disease. If it were i would certainly not want to have to give up an occasional swim with my kids! No matter what i do i will always, like most asthmatics have the disease for life. Its like this- If your knee only hurt when you went up stairs would you stop walking up stairs or get treatment for your knee? . Most people would get treatment rather change their life to suit their ailment. There seems to be this idea that asthmatics must change their life to kowtow (sp) to this disease- how we are singled out for this bizarre behavior i have no idea. I bought into for a while and i am sorry that i did i ``avoided '' a lot of fun and good times when asthma dictated what i could and could not do. Life is to be Lived not avoided.

(green boogies) I took him to the pedi for treatment, she feels he has Asthma. I think he has bronchitis because hes mildly coughing but also has wheezing. This is the second time in a year hes gotten this same thing. The last time it lasted for a couple months even with Polmacort and albuterol treatments. Is asthmas supposed to go away after treatment for a couple of days? Or will the wheezing continue? Im confused ??? Is is Asthma or Bronchitis?######If he is wheezing (and has a cough) that goes on for that long, it is more likely that he has asthma. Bronchitis usually goes away completely after a few weeks, and people with bronchitis may wheeze a little bit but it 's unusual for the wheezing to stick around once the infection is gone (even though the cough may). Asthma does not go away after treatment for a few days, it is a chronic (ongoing) disease. Because your son is only 4 it is probably too early to tell for sure if he asthma, particularly if he is mostly wheezing after being sick, but you should treat it like it is asthma. He may outgrow the wheezing, or may only wheeze when he 's been sick, but it 's unlikely that bronchitis is causing him to wheeze for two months after an illness.######Bronchitis is a lot more serious then some people think. Many common colds can be chest infections. . but they are virus, and you can only give it time to get over. Asthma meds work wonders for this. But it may not be asthma. Bronchitis is a bacteria, and people die from bacterial infections, because unless you have a super strong immune system, chances are you can not get over it yourself. If you have not given your child antibiotics, then this can go on and on and on, if its bacterial, it can do a lot of damage to the lungs. And one day he will NEED a puffer for life. If you have tried antibiotics and they do n't work. It could be a super bug, or asthma, or a virus, either one, the doctor will use the same inhaler, as all treated the same. So first thing to do is antibiotics. If they do n't work. . then get a puffer weather it is asthma or not, it do n't matter he needs to breath.######Make him lay on the couch, feet on the couch and head and arms down to the floor, then pat fairly hard on his back, this will break things up in the lungs. My son at age 4 had asthma, one lung collapsed and this is what I had to do. It helped a lot, eventually the lung healed itself. Sunny.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

It started out as a cold (week one), then went to more coughing and stuff (week two), and I went to the doctor who said bronchitis. Was n't feeling much better, still had coughing and tight chest, went back to the doctor twice, and the first time they said maybe something bacterial so I got antibiotics, and the second time said oh, maybe asthma because the cough and tight chest have been going on for so long, but then said no because there was no wheezing so it must be an adenovirus (week 3). So the latest doctors visit was Monday, and I have to say, I 'm not feeling any better... Still coughing on and off (had a fit of coughing the other day that lasted 20 minutes, and that was with taking Tessalon Perles, drinking tea with honey and sitting in a steamy bathroom), chest still feels tight, and I 'm still absolutely exhausted! Could I possibly have asthma? As I said, my doctor said no because she did n't hear any wheezing, but I know that what I have are symptoms. She just said that it 's the virus clearing up and that 's what 's causing it all. Opinions?######It is possible to have asthma and not wheeze. I have what is called ``cough variant asthma. '' My primary symptom is a deep nasty cough. I do n't test positive for asthma on the tests that are supposed to tell you if you have it or not. I 'm just one of the odd ducks. I was diagnosed by the fact that the medications I take make a difference. See if you can get your doctor to give you a breathing treatment in the office. If it helps you, that would be a strong indicator that you may have asthma. Otherwise try to get some rest and see if it does n't get better on it 's own. If you get really bad go to urgent care or the ER and say you have asthma. And if your doctor does n't seem to help, look for a new one, possibly a pulmonologist or asthma/allergy doc. Take care and do n't give up until you get the help you deserve. ~ blue######That 's the thing... I 've been resting like crazy. I 've missed a lot of school, and I take naps... And you would think that after this long, I 'd be better. But I 'm not. I have a feeling I 'll be going back to the doctor as she said if I was n't better in a week to go in again.######You 're ahead of me. I waited 3 months after getting sick before I finally went to the doctor. (I forgot to mention that my asthma started from a bad cold that would not go away.) Hope you feel better soon. ~ blue######Hi, Yes definitely, here is my story. i have mentioned this a few times on the boards, my PC doctor said i didnt have asthma because I didnt have the classic sign of ``wheezing ''. For two years i had a hunch i may have it as no matter what i did i was exhaused, breathless, etc.. . but he told me no. During the year i was getting worse, nauseas, trouble breathing, chest tightness, tiredness, etc.... in May i really had trouble breathing and went to an allergy specialist for regular allergy testing and she just happened to give me the breathing test. Well she diagnosed my problem right away and i was so thankful for her. I got inhalers, etc.... Im not 100 &#37; but the meds are helping most of the time and im so relieved that i went outside of this doctor. He too thought the classic sign was ``wheezing '' which i didnt have. Even after going back to my PC and telling him what my new diagnosis was, he had the nerve to smirk and tell me ``oh those breathing tests are off sometimes ''. Thats all nice but i know my body and probably would have died if i listened to him. You definitely know when you feel like you are breathing through a straw and the horrible tiredness that follows it. Nothing and i mean nothing (even sleeping straight through the night and eating a great diet didnt do anything for me so i knew something was very wrong). Go outside of this doctor and get a 2nd opinion from someone who knows more about this.######Wow Ginger, that 's crazy! I have a feeling I 'm going to be back to the doctor's on Monday, and I 'll definitely bring it up! If she still says no, then I 'll go see someone else.######Yes definitely go outside of that doctor if you get the same answer. My doctor is old and obviously thinks everything has to have the classic signs. I have even brought up heart issues being its in my family and he told me ``oh you are only 40 years old '' you shouldnt have problems. It wasnt until my asthma diagnosis that he actually did an echocardiogram to double check things.######Heh. My doctor is definitely pretty old school.######Well, I 'm going to the doctor again tomorrow... Any advice on how to approach things?######I have cough variant asthma as well. I rarely have obvious wheezing with my asthma. I think that went years with active asthma before it was officially diagnosed. My cough was always attributed to allergies and sinus problems. Here is a list of other asthma signs outside of the obvious wheezing. I found out earlier this summer through a really observant doc that there are other symptoms that are also associated with asthma. I hope these help. cough itchy chin itchy or sore throat dark under eye circles stuffy, runny or congested nose tiredness mood change-- grouchy or extra quiet itchy, glassy or watery eyes thirst sneezing stomach ache headache fever restlessness eczema flare-up sweating heartburn change in face color- pale or flushed throat clearing restlessness heart beating faster trouble sleeping yawning######Does your doc have to give you a referral to a pulmonologist? If not, just go to one. That 's who you should be going to for asthma anyway.######The warning signs in bold are ones that I have been experiencing recently: itchy chin stuffy, runny or congested nose mood change-- grouchy or extra quiet stomach ache fever restlessness eczema flare-up sweating heartburn change in face color- pale or flushed throat clearing restlessness heart beating faster yawning So, I guess there 's a fair number of them. As to whether I can go to a pulmonologist on my own... I believe my mom's insurance allows you to make appointments freely even with specialists, but I 'm not sure... Not that my parents would take me unless the doctor said they should. (I 'm 17 by the way, almost 18, but am still in high school, live at home, and have no money)..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

Do you have carpet in your home. Do you have a matress pad cover. Are your pillow material made of feathers? How often do you dust? Do you wash your beddings once a week in hot water? When is the last time you cleaned out your air ducts/vents? Do you have plants in your home or pets? Have you ever seen a ear/nose/throat doctor lately, if not you should see one to get tested. Allergies, asthma can sometimes trigger each other. Check the outside of your home, grass, flowers, trees, all of these could be a ``triggering '' factor.

Has anyone ever heard or read that? Does soy bother you? I have been taking soy capsules and wheezing badly. I may be having asthma due to another irritant. I am trying to figure it out. Thanks for any information or ideas you may have.######I 've never heard that. I eat a lot of soy, being a vegetarian, and I do n't have any problems with it. If you were allergic to it, then I suppose it could cause asthma symptoms. Have you tried stopping the soy and seeing if the asthma improves?######``Generally '' I have never heard of soy being a problem for asthmatics, but I personally had a soy sensitivity as a child that did give me problems. I 'm sure it is an individual thing. Some things trigger asthma, even foods, for some people and not for others. Soy is in the peanut family and it is common for people with a peanut allergy to react to soy as well. If you are wheezing more than normal and taking the soy, I would try eliminating it for 2 weeks- giving it time to work through your system. Then reintroduce it. I 've heard of many people that had mild to moderate symptoms of an allergy and once they had eliminated it for a period of time, they improved, but when they reintroduced it, their reactions were way worse than when they had taken it before. Our bodies are tricky! Good luck and definately talk to your doctor.######Yes, I have stopped the soy capsules. I am still wheezing and need medication, however, the symptoms are less. In a week, I am going to take the soy again and see what happens.######almondjoy-- you might want to be careful with that. i am allergic to soy and many other foodschemical and you name it. i have a different reaction to all of them. sometimes it is typical head stuff and sometimes it 's hives or gasto distress. if you asthma is allergy related as mine is you may have an allergy to soy or possible just a sensitivity. has the dr. given you anything for your asthma?.######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

Visited my regular eye doctor and he showed me a picture of the inside of my eye. Very scary indeed. He sent me to a specialist who refered me to another doctor who is a neurologist. Tests were done and the black spot was diagnosed as optic neuritis. At the time I had taken time off from my electrical job and was without insurance. The neurologist advised me to go back to work as he said that optic neuritis is sometimes the predecessor to multiple sclerosis and if I did get MS I would def need the insurance for the meds I would need. Has anyone here had optic neuritis and how long did it take your eye vision to get clearer? Mine has improved slightly but it still looks like I 'm trying to see thru a screen. Has anyone had MS after optic neuritis?######Please have a look at my thread `Papilloedema + macular oedema '. My condition was first diagnosed as optic neuritis, then as optic neuropathy and only after an MRI and fluorescein angiopathy was it determined that the optic nerve was not involved. It is true that optic neuritis is an early sign of MS but not everyone who gets optic neuritis goes on to develop MS. Anyway, as my case shows, until you have more detailed tests, you ca n't even be sure that it is optic neuritis. I hope you get your insurance situation sorted out because you really need to get your condition diagnosed asap.############Hi there Wirewoman- not sure if you will get this b/c it has been a while since you posted.

My visual field is irregular, but the problems are in my peripheral vision and my central vision is fine, which, according to the eye doc is not what you find in optic neuritis. Also, my pupil reaction is normal. Given the normal pupil reaction and irregular visual field test, how could this possibly be retrobulbar optic neuritis?

However I do n't think I understand what is meant by the word ``attack '' in the criteria. I had originally assumed it was limited to optic neuritis. However, does it include other ``episodes '' or symptoms that are associated with MS and are these symptoms limited or varied? For example, one of the scenarios in the McDonald Criteria is, if I 'm not mistaken, two or more lesions (brain for instance) and an abnormal CSF reading and one ``attack ''. Does the attack have to be optic neuritis or can it be something else? I know the attack is supposed to be temporary but in cases of Progressive MS, I 've understood it 's not always temporary but a gradual worsening. Gosh, am I just slow or does n't this criteria of ``attack '' seem a bit vague? I 'd really appreciate any clarification on this term! thanks, kelpie######I do n't think you are ``slow '', I 'm not sure about the definition of ``attack '', either. But I do know that it does n't have to be ON. The ``attack '' that sent me to the doctor (and ultimately led to my dx) was SEVERE L'Hermitte's Sign. It lasted several months. I believe duration of a particular exacerbation is part of the definition, along with severity. Since I 've learned about MS, I am pretty sure this was n't my first ``attack ''.######My understanding is that to be considered a true ``attack '', the symptoms have to last more than 24 hours. And it is not just optic neuritis. Sensory, weakness, balance, etc.... lg######Thanks, lilc and Igrot. I 've also read ``attack '' defined kind of loosely it seems, as any ``neurological disturbance associated with MS ''. Whereas in your case lilc that l'Hermitte's like optic neuritis is often associated with MS, the kinds of things Igrot mentioned like the weakness and dizziness is harder to pin down as so many other illnesses are characterized by those symptoms. So I 'd suppose neuropathy like tingling or numbness or cognitive problems would also be an attack? So confusing !! Gosh it 's great to be able to ask questions as the doctors can make a person feel like such a pest for doing that. Thanks again. kelpie######My issue with ``attack '' is how do I know I 've had two separate attacks. My doctor has told me I would need to have a 2nd `attack ' to be definitively diagnosed. Well, how do I know I have n't had two separate attacks. I had several symptoms all happen at once and all but one have gone away. So, is that fact that they all happened at once considered one attack?######dgibson70 I have been told that I have mild MS, but need to have a 2nd attack or relapse for definate MS. I said to my neuro `would that be something like more pain on my left side ', he said that it would be something completely new, i.e. I have problems all on my left side, he said that if the problems started on the right side or I had problems with my eyes then they would be classed as a new attack (s). Might not be the same for you but I hope that helps. Sooty.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Multiple Sclerosis

Like every other drug he was prescribed, it only made him worse. But you will find plenty of people who swear that it worked wonders. We all metabalize drugs differently, so what helps one patient may not help another. The current drugs of choice for AD are Aricept, Exelon, Reminyl and Mementine-- when you can get it from Germany, I do n't know of it 's FDA approved yet. Hope this gives you an idea or two, good luck, it 's never easy.######Thank you for the ideas. Will look into them he has an appt. on Feb. 4 and I would like to be prepared. I have found that the more you know and the more aggresive you are with the doctor the better the out come. Thanks again...######Dear Always, My mother was on Risperidone. Bettyhere is right, all patients react to medications differently. Also, prescribing for the elderly is difficult; as most drug testing is on a younger age group and not applicable for the older patient. Doctors are given ``guidelines '' for dosage, however those dosage charts are made for effect on younger patients and may be too strong for your loved one; or worse yet, to weak. Everyone is an individual as far as drugs go. And, you need to be aware of the side effects of all the medications you AND your loved one is on. Not just the drugs; but, even the over-the-counters that those drugs are mixed with, (as cross-druging can cause problems as well). A good resource for this information is your local pharmasist, as they sometimes are more aware of drug interactions and side effects of most drugs than the doctors. You should be monitoring every drug and suppliment and charting those on a written record. A record that you share with the doctor from time to time, in order to get a effective and an efficient drug therapy program. This is quite important for the proper care of an Alzheimer's patient. It 's called drug ``titration '', or the slow and careful monitoring and constant regulating of the drug dosages until the optimun drug program has been reached. Doctors do not even always know the right drug or the right amounts of that drug for YOUR loved one. So, keep records and keep in touch with him so that he is aware of what is working and what is not. Pay special attention to the patients reactions and attitudes just before the drug dosage is given and the hour following the medication. This will give the doctor accurate informations as to whether the drug should be raised, lowered, discontinued or substituted for a better drug for that symptom. Most people think that once you recieve a diagnosis of Alzheimer's that the only medications that are given are one's for ALZHEIMER'S. As this disease is one of the brain, there are many more symptoms that need to be treated, other than mear Alzheimer's or memory loss or cognitive functioning. Sub behavioral problems are quite common like hallucinations and delerium. These other behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's are treated quite successfully with medications also. As I have said, my mom was on Risperidone or Rispedal for these dellusions, and it worked quite well once we got her raised to a level that was effective. It took a real battle with her doctor to get her raised to a level of effectiveness. One where she could finally allow someone to care for her effectively. But, the battle with the medical profession was worth it. I DO understand WHY the fight on my part. No one wants to have their loved one all doped up, where they sit and stare like a ``Zombie ''. But, in my case, my mom needed an extremely high dosage just to function halfway normal. So, get out your notebook. Write down everything that he is on. What it does, how much, who prescribed it, side effects to be aware of, and effectiveness. Keep careful notes and keep ``bugging '' the doctor to get the right adjustment. Ask for his advise and talk to your pharmasist too. Between you, the doctor and the pharmasist, and your careful observations and note takeing, you will eventually get a drug treatment program that is effective. Just, do n't give up the fight; it 's always worth it in the end. (My mom was on something for depression, anxiety, phycosis, (the Respidal), sleep and Alzheimer's. With careful monitoring, her behavior, attitude and overall physical condition improved a hundred fold). My prayers are with you. Gizmo######My Mum was in hospital for assessment just over a year ago (she has had Dementia for 12 years + but was never treated until Dad passed away in Oct 01) Whilst in hospital she was given Haliperidol as well as Valium, Sleeping Tablets and more- she was in a permanent stupor- but her behavior was controlled. She left hospital and went into Residential care and her medication was changed to Respiridone (.5 mg twice a day)- over a couple of months her head stooped (almost from the shoulders) which made her pacing even more dangerous as she only looked at the ground. Then her neck dropped to the left, her left eye watered permanently, as did her nose and mouth from that side. Also when she stood up she started leaning backwards (loss of equilibrium we were told) and her pacing gradually stopped. She went to the hospital and it was diagnosed that the curve of her neck was a reaction to the Respiridone/Haliperidol etc and was taken off all meds- she was given something for Parkinsons as an alternative. Without the respiridone she was hallucinating, agitated, argumentative. She went back to the hospital 6 weeks later and was put on olanzipene- which was not as effective as the Respiridone had been- but still helped. It was left that the dosage would be adjusted to suit her. Unfortunately, 3 days later she tried to stand up, fell and broke her hip- (November) and was admitted to hospital until today when she was discharged to a Nursing Home. Mum is OK at the moment (as long as you leave her alone and dont touch her) but she will lash out (as she did to nurses who tried to take blood pressure etc) Only the male nurses took care of her in hospital. Her neck has improved- though it will never be back to normal. As you have said, all medications need to be monitored as each individual has different reactions to them, some good, some bad. Thanks for listening. Lucie######Had the doctor's appt on the 4th and they kept him on Aricept and the Clonapine and then they added a new drug called Seroquel? not sure if that is the correct spelling. He is to take 1/2 a pill for seven days then after the week he is to take 1 to 2 pills a day. Just thought I would thank everyone for there replys and send you an update.

I have seen B12 deficiency referenced as a potential cause of such symptoms, alternative to Alzheimer's-- and I have seen at least one article in a prominent newspaper implicating such a deficiency in the dementia of one elderly patient-- however I have also read in a medical text that this explanation is a relic from the 1950s to which the medical community no longer subscribes. I was also told by one neurologist that in 25 years of practice, he never encountered an older patient whose dementia went away with the help of additional B12. So what is actually the current state of thinking-- does anyone believe that some patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's due to normal MRI etc. might simply suffer from low B12?######I 've heard that those with Alzheimer's are more likely to be deficient in Vitamin D.

The doc just responded that they (the neurologist) are ``just going to tell you the same thing. '' I got nowhere. Basically, he 's telling me it 's unnecessary. Dad is on Medicare/Secure Horizons HMO. The doc has never really flat out told him dad's diagnosis. When an MRI was done, doc told dad it was ``normal aging ''. He 's prescribed the Exelon patch and Namenda. (Among other meds for type2 diabetes, etc.) Dad's walking is getting so bad. I think it 's because of a head/brain thing (not so much physical). I would just like to get a neurologist's opinion and have them review dad's meds. I do n't think I could get dad to do another MRI. Other than getting down on my knees pleading (which I refuse), what could I say to the doc to influence him to give me a referral? I hate HMOs. gogo######Hi Gogo, How about asking for a memory test? My FIL was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in late 2006. He was wondering if he could drive, so he asked the GP to send him to a place for memory test. He went to a behavior center to get tested in the office with 3 hours verbal test. He came out with Alzheimer's. Not very accurate in terms of stage because he lied to the psychologist that he took a shower at night but he refused to take a shower at that time and looked dirty. He was in moderate stage. (The test came out with early stage.) Just ask for a memory test so you know his level. There is MMSE test also and a nurse can do it too. It depends on the GP. Is he supportive with dementia or he thinks dementia is just old aging ??? A good GP should know that the diagnosis for dementia is important. It helps pinpoints the issues and stages. It also helps how you handle the caregiving. Good luck, Nina######The doc did his own Memory Test over a year ago. After that he ordered the MRI, and proceeded to tell my dad it was normal aging. Fast forward a year, the nurse had written down ``Alzheimer's '' on his application for AL.. So, I guess it 's in his file ???? However, I had to ask her to change what she wrote or they would n't accept him at the facility. (changed it to memory issues or something like that) He 's now been living at the IL/AL place since Nov' 10. I do not doubt that he has dementia. I am not convinced it 's AZ. I do n't know if it even matters. I just want to make sure he 's on the right meds/right dosages. I 'd rather not switch docs. (Dad likes him.) I just get the ``he 's old '' it 's expected attitude... which is true, but, he has n't known my dad long and I wonder if he 's taking too many meds. I would just feel better getting some advice from a neurologist. Or, am I way out of line? Do people with AZ need to go to neurologists? am I going overboard? I was just wondering if there was something I could say to the doc to get him to give us the referral? Like he 's hallucinating or something ?? It 's almost like the doc does n't want him to go elsewhere cause he 'll lose out on$ ?? or, does it hurt doctors to give referrals ?? like with Medicare/insurance I do n't know... gogo######I think both neurologist and/or psychiatrist can do the diagnosis. Usually GP is not that good at it so often they refer to someone else. Not sure about this GP. However, I do believe that when it is sort of early stage, it would be hard to detect it. He needs to have another test. My FIL did it around moderate stage when it was quite visible that he was crazy like being dirty and could get lost and all that... Frankly, it matters if it is vascular dementia or Alzheimer's. ALZ is the most common one but vascular dementia is the second common one. Yes, it does matter what type of dementia he has. ALZ is just one type. Vascular dementia is another type. The GP just does not know which type and he claimed it was normal aging... I believe HMO does some harm but it depends on the GP also. You know, why do n't you try the AL- does the AL have their own test? Maybe the nurse there did their own test and came out with Alzheimer's. The type is important because this decides what kind of med and prognosis. ALZ is very clear in terms of 7 clinical stages, but other types may have different stages or meds. In terms of caregiving, it may not matter what type, but it helps to know. The real issue is, if he really has dementia of any type, he would need to be in the locked memory unit some day soon. Good luck, Nina######Gogo... I do believe it is unfair to you to put Alzheimer's on his medical records and not give you the appropriate testing and information so you can make appropriate decisions for and with your Dad. This is so very typical of general practitioners. They just do n't get it... unless they have been personally touched by this disease in a loved one. The type of cognitive problems created by the various types are dementia are NOT natural aging. If Dad forgets where his keys are occasionally that 's normal. If he forgets he had keys or what they are for that 's a problem. Nope... you local family doctor just does n't get it. Even with a MMSE score that indicates a problem they think it will all be ok. They may do an MRI but that does n't show Alzheimer's. There may be some shrinkage when the disease is further along but it is not a diagnostic tool at this time. So I do believe you should get a referral. I would ask... I have concerns and for my own peace of mind could we please have a referral? Yes, there is a difference between the various kinds of dementia. Each has it 's own symptoms and time line. A proper diagnosis and information about that particular dementia will give you some guidance as to what to expect. Mom has Alzheimer's and Dad had Vascular Dementia and they were very different. Knowing the difference has helped to know what to expect and how to help them both So be persistent in requesting your Dad a referral. You are his advocate and things get done when you insist. Yes, you can demand what you want. You are not at the mercy of the doctor and whatever he decides in the moment. I would pester until I got a yes, please get off my phone, answer Love, deb######Gogo, Sometimes some GPs have the old school or traditional idea that dementia is normal aging or that there is no certain test to do that. The fact is nowadays there are more tools available to find out about Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. I do n't know if you can ask for a second opinion from another doctor in HMO? If the AL has its own doctor, ask the doctor to get him another memory test. No doctors can hold the patient hostage and you are always entitled to a second opinion. I never like the stuff that the doctor has our medical records and we have to pay to get the copy and all that. It is our own medical records and it is our health. A doctor should not hold that much power over us, esp. the GP. There are a few times when my GP have different opinions from the walk-in GPs. So one doctor is not an expert for all. Good luck, Nina######Thanks guys, Dad is in the independent part of AL.. He gets his meals in the dining room and I have peace of mind that he is not all alone. He could not get his license renewed beginning of this year TG (but believe me, he TRIED and TRIED). I really don t want to have to start over with a new GP. I am worn down. My mom passed away 12/09, so that is part of the whole equation too. When I asked the GP about NPH, he said the MRI didn t show anything. Poof! end of discussion. I then went on and on about dad s walking. Of course, dad walked nicely in front of the doc. But, GP went ahead and sent him for a walking evaluation. PT said he needed therapy. PT never heard of NPH. Go back to GP and was told no, he s fine, doesn t need PT. Honestly, I was not going to be able to take him NOR would he have gone. I had sent dad s MRI results to a contact at the Hydrocephalus Foundation and she forwarded the results to the head of the medical advisory board. This is what he said, ``It sounds like an atrophic brain, but yes it could be nph. The pt should see a neurologist to have a workup, as the ct diagnosis can not be conclusive about dementia or nph. '' This doc was referred to as an N/S ?? neurosurgeon ?? I am so overwhelmed and frustrated. Did I mention I work and have a husband and 6 year old? Why is it so difficult to get a referral? Is it seen as failure? My guess is that it is about ego ?? I mean what does the GP have to lose by giving dad a referral? MONEY ?? And about the nurse putting Alzheimer s on the paperwork I really do believe she wrote that based upon the meds dad has been prescribed by GP. She did not know at all HOW to fill out the paperwork. She brought me back to the room to help her. I just wish there was a key word I could throw at the GP to get him to assist me. I m so annoyed. Yet, I m running out of gas. You 're right. I feel like we 're being held hostage. It sucks to be a senior and not have lots of money. I can only imagine what it would cost to see a neurologist for a visit out of pocket. gogo######Maybe you should show that contact document to the GP. I had to push my GP to give an MRI for my jaw. At frist she said I do n't need it. I was told pretty bluntly that I needed no MRI when she wrote the order for me. Then she saw that MRI did show that I have dislocated left jaw and all that. What can she do? She suggested that I see a surgeon for opnion. Anyway, I go with the dental surgeon's advice and will see another guy. it looks like I was so bad that I was telling my GP what to do. People actually said she is very good... The point here is the GP sometimes is wrong and then she can make correction later on without any apology at all... Can you see another GP without transferring? I sure hope there is soomeone who can help out. I think in the mean time, you just have to focus on caregiving. As long as he is happy, do n't bother with the diagnosis. Soon, when he gets sicker, then you can ask for another test. It looks like you need to have some episode so you can have the excuse to ask the GP for another evaluation. Take care, Nina######You know what I would have said? ``Yes, I understand they may well tell me the same thing but the family would like to go ahead anyway. Whom do you think would be a good choice- or- I 've heard good things about Dr. XYZ and he 's in the network. '' And just sit there and stare back at him- firmly.######GP's are bad about cutting you off when they do n't know. It is an ego thing. N/S is probably neurosurgeon. Being in the position he is in he is definitely more qualified than the GP to make an assessment of the scan. Is there a way you can call the insurance company and request a referral on the basis of the information you have from the Hydrocephalus Foundation? It 's worth a try! Question... what medication is your Dad taking? Did the GP prescribe Excelon, Aricept, or Namenda? There had to be something there to lead the clerk to the Alzheimer's diagnosis. Why would the GP prescribe medication specific to dementia if there is none there? Key word... litigation! I hate to say it but that 's the word they understand. A letter to the doctor, including the information from the Hydrocephalus Foundation, requesting a referral for diagnostic clarification is appropriate. A statement that it would be unfortunate if Dad had a disease that could be cured if it was diagnosed early and it went undiagnosed. I am not above putting the pressure back on the GP. Let him know, as a family, you need clarification to rule out potential diagnosis that were indicated on the scan. It still amazes me how may doctor there are that do n't understand Alzheimer's, NPH, and other diseases of the elderly. Old age is not a diagnosis! If you do n't get what you need from this GP... it is better to change and get your Dad the medical care he needs than to stay because just because it is easier. Maybe a fresh set of eyes is what is needed to get your Dad an adequate diagnosis. Mom's doctor was much as your Dad's GP. Her MMSE score was low but it was ok... she just needed to focus more, try harder. Everything was ok and there was a beautiful field of daisies out back... I called his office and told them I was talking Mom to the Memory Assessment Research Service for an evaluation. I would be coming by to pick up her records including her CT scan and I expected a referral to be included in the information. I went on to say if he had any questions please discuss them with my Dad's doctor who was his partner. I do n't know if that exchange took place of not but Dad's doctor was aware that Mom had overdosed Dad with medication and then was unaware of what was going on. So yep, use what you get from one source to get what you need from another Love, deb.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Alzheimer's Disease & Dementia

Like any diagnosis, I am always interested in ALL the possibilities of the causes. Doctors refer to it as a differential diagnosis. You can google ``differential diagnosis, meningitis '' & go through the list of possibilities. The reason I suggest this is that I had severe meningitis 12 years ago where I was bed ridden for over a year. My doctor kept trying to just treat the symptoms & when they did n't go away he said I had fibromyalgia. I finally found a doctor who treated patients with fibro & after tests found I had lyme disease. The co-infection ehrlichia was probably the reason why the meningitis was so severe. Lyme can mimic many other disorders, so it one of the illnesses that should be on your differential list. (Although I must tell you that you will have to have the right lab tests done & most doctors are not aware that the typical tests are not that accurate. Do a little studying on why there is controversy over lyme tests & find a lyme literate doctor & a good lab.) The effects of meningitis can be devastating and sometimes long lasting like mine. I would encourage you to seek a doctor who is compassionate in treating meningitis & pain. A neurologist would be a doctor I would get an opinion from. Keep looking for answers & solutions & never give up. When one doctor ca n't help, or tells you it is all in your head, find another one. You may have to be patient and try many different meds before you find the right combo for you. Best wishes.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

After getting out of the hospital I starting having severe migraines and spent the next 6 months visiting specialist to figure out what was wrong with me and how to control the migraines. Has anyone else ever had this or heard of it as a side effect. It 's been 13 years since I had meningitis. I also ended up with a food allergy after having meningitis. The food allergy is actually the trigger for my migraines.######I had meningtis (meningaccocal septacemia) about 6 years ago.I still have reaccuring pain in my head, in the same place a had the pain when i was so ill (its like a stabbing pain, just in one place. I am so forgetful all the time. Since my i llness i have now an under active thyroide, i dont know if this is connected! I have found this site really helpful, just reading other peoples experiences.######3 years ago this month I was very ill with meningitis and I still suffer on occassions with great pain in my head, I am very forgetful and I am unable to concentrate for long periods. My family and I feel that I should be over this by now and it has got me down- since finding this site I now feel I have a better understanding of this illness and how it affects each individual differently and I know I have been lucklier than others which I am grateful for- I would like to know ways of helping myself to cope/deal with this better, and ways of knowing if/when I 'm getting better are there any medical tests available for people like me######At age 3 I had meningococcal meningitis. The first migraine I can remember was at the age of 10. I am now 29 yrs old and still get them. Could this be from the meningitis I had as a child.######I went to Mayo clinic in Rochester MN to try to find answers concerning recurrent viral meningitis. I have had meningitis three confirmed times with hospital stays each time. Severe pain. Scans, MRI's, blood serum, angiograms all negative. With this I also have chronic migraines. Mayo clinic linked my meningitis to the migraines. It is rare, but there are confirmed cases. The key for me is to stop the migraines, and therefore stop the meningitis. I have exhausted Neuro's and internet searches. Best outlook for me is to keep my bag packed for the next hospital stay. There is no cure for this. There are no specialists.######wow, this is the first time I know of anyone else having recurrent meningitis.I 'm 57 and have had 6 cases (the first actually equine strain encephalitis) of confirmed viral meningitis. I started getting migraines 15 years ago. very rotten business and I feel for you. I did knock down the migraine frequency to once a month (or 3 in two months) and duration from several days to 2. Magnesium, 400 mg riboflavin, and progesterone cream, are minimum requirements now. And of course I really upped any supplyment that increases immunity (vit c, garlic, good vitamins, enough sleep, and good food)######I had tarted having migraines in my 30's and had meningitis at age 16 (bacterial) I think it is related. I never noticed being forgetful until I took Topamax. . for prevention.######I take propanonol for migraine daily therapy and love it. I tried to take Topamax and it gave me a bad reaction. I have tried all the other meds too and I was really tired the next day. Ask your doc about propanonol. It does lower your blood pressure too so look at that as well. Good luck!######I had bacterial meningitous when i was 16 and now am in my 30; s. I had the extreme pain in the head and rash. At first the docters kept asking if i was sexual active and that maybe it was linxed to that. After a painful spinal tap it was confirmed bacterial meningitous. I was hospitalized for a week and then continued with home care for another week, i never had headaches before hand but i find since the meningitous i have severe migraines normally on my right side. The doctor says it has nothing to do with the meningitous but sometime I wonder if they are linked. I am now getting the migraines on the right, they go away and within days the migraine moves to the left side and eventually all over.######I had meningitis when i was 7, both viral and baterial, one after the other, it 's 12 years later and i still get migraines and right temple pain now, the doctor said theyr not linked but i had severe migraines while i had it... just living with it since the drug they gave me made me fat and depressed: S######I had viral meningitis when I was 12 and at the age of 16 I was diagnosed with chronic migraines. I was curious if they are in anyway related.######Hi fellow survivors, I had viral meningitis in July 2010 and was in hospital for 10 days. Until recently I thought the only side effect was an my inability to recall common words, which only happens occasionally. BUT I was released from hospital yesterday after being admitted for 12 days with a chronic migraine. It was almost exactly the same symptoms as the meningitis. The neurologist that saw me said he believed that it was directly linked to the trauma to the brain last July. He put me on a low dose of endep every night which is meant to act as a preventative. wish me luck with that !!!! Quick question: does anybody know of good websites about migraines and treatment etc, you google and come up with thousands so. Hariel######Dear Hariel, I am just now finding this site and your post. I had viral meningitis from the Flu in Feb. 1997. On Sept 29,1999 I got the migraine from hell and have had maybe 20 migraine free days since. I had the ``million dollar '' work-up- all negative. My husband is a board certified family physician and a fellow with the AAFP. He was convinced that there is a connection, altho the neurologists do n't think so. I 've been to Thomas Jefferson Headache Clinic in Philadelphia where the hyerspecialist could n't help. Everything works for a few weeks or months and then stops working. The triptans gave me stroke-like symptoms, so I ca n't take those. We did hear one Neurologist lecture on headache and stated a very definite connection between history of menningitis and chronic daily migraine, but offered no real helpful treatment. I stay active and functional and happy despite the pain that would stop most people only because I have no choice, and I know I am blessed with a wonderful husband who would move heaven and earth to relieve it if he could and two great children (now adults) who are the joy of my life. I love my God with all my heart and have a deep abiding faith and hope in Him. I KNOW there is a connection between menningitis and daily migraine- I am proof. I also know that it is possible to deal with it- I am proof of that, too. I will pray for you and others who suffer as we do. Melanie######Melanie, Thank you for sharing your story. In 1999 I also had viral meningitis and my first headache from ``hell ''. From that day until now I 've had only a handful of days each year where I 've been migraine-free. I have an incredibly supportive husband and 3 wonderful children who keep me going everyday. I pray for the day that my head will no longer be in pain. But after years of seeing every doctor, specialist, and everything between I have accepted the fact that pain is a part of my daily life. I thought I was alone in this journey... I 'm sorry you 're going through this too but it 's also nice to know someone understands my world. Again... Thanks for sharing. . , Alisha######My wife has just finished her 2nd issue with meningitis and ever since her 1st one in 99, she has migraines daily. Most times they are controlled by Butterbur (natural stores carry this) and when it gets real bad, she uses Excedren Migraine. She is worried that her stomach is going to ulcer with constant doses, so we have looked for other options. The doctors thought at first that it was hormonal, so she underwent a partial. That did n't help! Then she went to a pain specialist, who referred her to a neurologist. A botox shot to the base of the skull took the pain away for about a week. We are lost and just need to find something for her. I did n't realize this was such a major problem. It makes staying employed a difficult task too when you ca n't be out in the light or ca n't stop vomitting. I too am glad to see that this is n't an isolated incident. Please keep me updated as to any break throughs you have. Butterbur, Spark with O2 Gold and rehydrate also work if you have a friend that sells Advocare. We have been using it since 2008 and it helps, but they never really go away. Good Luck! Mike and Lillian######I just found this website and I too had both bacterial and viral meningitis. I spent 7 days in intensive care for the viral meningitis and almost died. I was 19 at the time and 26 when I had the bacterial meningitis. I have suffered from migraines from the time I was 26. It never even occurred to me there could be a link. Does anyone know if any studies are done to confirm the link? I have at the least 2 migraines a month if not more.######Hi all. I had aseptic meningitis where they could not find a cause. I too almost died & my life has never been the same. I just wanted to say that now after 11 years of searching for answers to all the crazy symptoms I 've had, I finally had a doctor who by chance tested me for a specific co-infection to Lyme disease caused by a tick bite. The infection is called human monocytic ehrlichiosis or ehrlichia chaffeenosis and all the symptoms fit the intense meningitis I had. I had a severe migraine and spinal swelling every day for over a year and then it slowly tapered off after that over another year. If I did n't find a compassionate doctor to address the migraines, throwing up, nausea, and pain at the time... I would n't have wanted to live; it was that bad. I 've had long lasting affects from the infection that the doctor said turned into Fibromyalgia, but really was from the Lyme disease. I am on a complicated protocol of antibiotics and supplements. I did n't get better because I wa n't treated long enough with an antibiotics at the initial hospitalization. Many of my neurologic symptoms have disappeared with the right treatment although I still have symptoms I 'm trying to manage. I just thought I 'd post my story in case anyone wants to consider the possibility that their meningitis may have been caused by Lyme or a co-infetion. Lyme is called the great imitator because it can mimic many other diseases. It can be misdiagnosed as MS, ALS, tumors etc. on MRIs. If you are interested in exploring more info on Lyme, you can private message me. 50% of patients do not remember a tick bite, nor a rash like myself. Getting the right tests done are really important as most of the tests doctor use today are not accurate enough, so getting treatment by a Lyme literate doctor is essential and testing from the right lab. It may be a long shot, but maybe it 's a possibility to look into. Best wishes..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

The fever lasted for 10 days where it did not exceed 102 after the 4th day and 100 after the 6th. If I had bacterial meningitis and did not go to the doctor would I notice something? What would the disabilities be? What would the differences be between a normal person and a person that had permanent damage? How long does bacterial meningitis last if left untreated? If I had viral meningitis, was it severe enough to have caused even the slightest permanent damage maybe brain damage? Would I notice it? How? How bad would it have to be? How common is it that viral meningitis caused permanent damage? Explain because I am worried after being really sick. Thank you.######overtak3n: Did you vomit or have diarreha? Was your neck stiff? Could you classify your headache as the worst you 've ever had? How lethargic were you? Bacterial Meningitis is very serious and can QUICKLY lead to death, so I 'm thinking it probably was n't that. Usually, from my understanding if it were another type of Meningitis, the headache would get so bad you 'd be at the hospital in misery. You mentioned you have been experiencing some kind of brain damage? What are you experiencing and how would you describe it? If you are really concerned, I would go see a neurologist. They can tell from tests if the tissue around the brain & spine are inflammed. You can discuss your symptoms. Best wishes, CharlieJane######I was asking what the symptoms would be if I had brain damage. No vomiting, diarrhea started late and lasted for about a day or 2 and was n't as bad. No stiff neck. I was pretty tired, but was able to get on the computer and ask questions. The headache was one of the worst I have had. I hope right now I have 100% fully recovered.######Hi overtak3n, I am sorry to hear that you have struggled. I do n't know the symptoms of brain damage.

Sometimes sinus infections wo n't clear no matter what antibiotics you take if there is a nasal polyp obstructing normal drainage. I once had a sinus infection for 8 weeks, (no antibiotic was helping) and finally a cat scan of my sinuses revealed a polyp. After the surgery to remove the polyp, the impacted infection could drain properly and I was back to normal.

I have nasal polyps and tested positive for mold and other environmental allergies and i have days when everything seems fine but I also have days that i feel like crap. Pressure and/or pain on the face (cheeks, nose and eyes), sometimes even tingling, maxillary sinus pain, upper teeth pain, ear fulness or sometimes pain etc and the doctors I saw said it 's sinus infection caused by allergies so take Allegra D or Zyrtec, use NAsonex, and everything should be ok. As I said, sometimes it is, but sometimes it 's not at all. I 've started seeing a naturopath doctor and I hope it 'll help a little bit, but I was wondering if any of you, the sinus pain sufferer, have any suggestion on what to do to improve my condition. I currently live in a city on the East Coast, with lots of humidity, but we 'll move shortly to Colorado, where the weather is dry and everybody says that this will help my sinus condition. Thanks.######Chronic sinusitis is usually a result of repeated antibiotics being used to treat sinuse congestion. If it is chronic you probably have a systemic candida infection and need to stop with the antibiotics and start with treating the systemic infection. I have had this for many years and finally think i have found the key to treating this thing created by my doctor way back in 1987.######I wo n't get into a detailed argument with the first responder to your post but would encourage you to be extremely wary of that non-scientific advice. The polyps may be the root cause of the infection not clearing. They can block the natural drainage passageways in your sinuses and cause infections to recur almost immediately. Has your doctor recommended anything to help shrink the polyps? Generally a short course of oral steroids followed by the use of a nasal steroid spray and Singulair are pretty effective at keeping polyps from recurring (unfortunately, there is no natural way to deal with polyps, they are difficult to treat and, if not addressed, can require surgery to remove them. Here 's a list: 1. Get a Neil Med Sinus Rinse bottle and irrigate your nasal passages 2-3 times a day. 2. Talk to your doctor about a steroid nasal spray to keep the inflammation at bay during allergy season. 3. Take an antihistamine daily during allergy season (and consider undergoing allergy testing). You really should look for an ENT or allergist who specializes in treating chronic sinusitis so you have someone who can help you manage this (if the ENT recommends surgery right away get a second opinion).######Scientific? I post nothing that is not verified medical fact.######When I lived in Colorado I had the worst sinus infection ever, caused by the dry air and dust. It was Colorado Springs in 1992. I do much better in a moist climate, but that 's just me. At least in Colorado there are good NDs to treat you.######I simply hope that people will take the time to actually verify those ``facts '' before they start thinking that antibiotics contribute to sinusitis. Bacterial sinus infections that are not properly treated with antibiotics can cause serious health problems.######I was given antibiotics and seldane only for my sinuse problems to return a short time later. I now have and have had chronic sinusitis for many years as a result of that witch doctor treatment and have now realized the source of the chronic sinusitis as well as the fact seldane was removed from the market as a dangerous drug. That 's what modern so called scientific medicine has done for me. I suspect you are in medicine and think you guys need to be ashamed of yourselves for what you do to people.######Your suspicions could n't be any more wrong. I have battled chronic sinusitis for 20 years but have had the good fortune to have been treated by 3 incredible doctors (2 ENTs and an allergist) who have helped me get my sinus issues under control. I wasted thousands of dollars on bogus natural treatments before I finally found a doctor who actually specialized in treating chronic sinusitis and I am incredible grateful to him (Dr. Donald Leopold at the University of Nebraska Medical Center) for helping treat and educate me about chronic sinusitis. I do n't want others who suffer from chronic sinusitis to spend the time and money chasing phony hope when there are real, scientifically proven, treatments out there. I certainly understand how people become frustrated because chronic sinusitis is a difficult disease to diagnose and treat, but blaming it on Seldane or antibiotics might just keep someone from getting the help they need to find lasting relief..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

If you know of any such products, please let me know. If you are interested, I give the reason for my request below. I just came across a very interesting report done by the Mayo Clinic which I would like to share with everyone. I pasted below a press release from the Clinic about the study. To summarize, they found that in 96% of the cases they studied, chronic sinusitis was NOT caused by allergies alone (although they may have been a factor). Instead, it was caused by an immune system response to the presense of fungus. This non-allergy mechanism does not involve the release of histamine, which is why antihistamines do not relieve chronis sinusitis. It also explains why immunotherapy does not relieve it. Although not mentioned in the press release, the full report (which I have read) explains that normal cultures usually miss the presence of fungus. The Clinic has developed a new method for taking cultures that is much more accurate in detecting fungus. Also not mentioned in the press release but noted in the full report is the fact that only 42% of the patients involved in the study tested positive for mold allergies by skin tests. So in other words, 58% of the patients had NO MOLD ALLERGIES but still had chronic sinusitis that was caused by the presense of fungus in their sinuses. For these patients, this non-allergy mechanism caused the inflammation-- not the histamine release that is part of an allergy mechanism. Bottom line: Until there is a new med that blocks this non-allergy mechanism, we need to do whatever we can to get rid of the fungus. That 's why I 'm asking for advice on antifungals. Thanks! Thursday, September 09, 1999 Mayo Clinic Study Implicates Fungus as Cause of Chronic Sinusitis ROCHESTER, MINN.-- Mayo Clinic researchers say they have found the cause of most chronic sinus infections-- an immune system response to fungus. They say this discovery opens the door to the first effective treatment for this problem, the most common chronic disease in the United States. (See graph.) An estimated 37 million people in the United States suffer from chronic sinusitis, an inflammation of the membranes of the nose and sinus cavity. Its incidence has been increasing steadily over the last decade. Common symptoms are runny nose, nasal congestion, loss of smell and headaches. Frequently the chronic inflammation leads to polyps, small growths in the nasal passages which hinder breathing. ``Up to now, the cause of chronic sinusitis has not been known, '' say the Mayo researchers: Drs. David Sherris, Eugene Kern and Jens Ponikau, Mayo Clinic ear, nose and throat specialists. Their report appears in the September issue of the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. ``Fungus allergy was thought to be involved in less than ten percent of cases, '' says Dr. Sherris. ``Our studies indicate that, in fact, fungus is likely the cause of nearly all of these problems. And it is not an allergic reaction, but an immune reaction. '' The researchers studied 210 patients with chronic sinusitis. Using new methods of collecting and testing mucus from the nose, they discovered fungus in 96 percent of the patients' mucus. They identified a total of 40 different kinds of fungi in these patients, with an average of 2.7 kinds per patient. In a subset of 101 patients who had surgery to remove nasal polyps, the researchers found eosinophils (a type of white blood cell activated by the body's immune system) in the nasal tissue and mucus of 96 percent of the patients. The results, the researchers say, clearly portray a disease process in which, in sensitive individuals, the body's immune system sends eosinophils to attack fungi and the eosinophils irritate the membranes in the nose. As long as fungi remain, so will the irritation. ``This a potential breakthrough that offers great hope for the millions of people who suffer from this problem, '' says Dr. Kern. ``We can now begin to treat the cause of the problem instead of the symptoms. '' More research is underway at Mayo Clinic to confirm that the immune response to the fungus is the cause of the sinus inflammation. The researchers are also working with pharmaceutical companies to set up trials to test medications to control the fungus. They estimate that it will be at least two years before a treatment will be widely available. The researchers distinguish chronic sinusitis-- sinusitis that lasts three months or longer-- from acute sinusitis, which lasts a month or less. They say that the cause of the acute condition is usually a bacterial infection. Antibiotics and over-the-counter decongestants are widely used to treat chronic sinusitis. In most cases, antibiotics are not effective for chronic sinusitis because they target bacteria, not fungi. The over-the-counter drugs may offer some relief of symptoms, but they have no effect on the inflammation. ``Medications have n't worked for chronic sinusitis because we did n't know what the cause of the problem was, '' says Dr. Ponikau. ``Finally we are on the trail of a treatment that may actually work. '' Thousands of kinds of single-cell fungi (molds and yeasts) are found everywhere in the world. Fungal spores (the reproductive part of the organism) become airborne like pollen. Some people develop allergies to fungi. The new evidence from the Mayo study suggests that many people also develop a different kind of immune system response..######-Health Issues###-Allergies

I 've suffered with this for several years now and all along thought it was sinusitis. I was even diagnosed with chronic sinusitis in 08 and i went back to ent recently ready to have the surgery only to be told that i no longer have it! The symptoms i am experiencing are even worse and the consultant thinks it could be neurological. She has prescribed me amitryptaline. I have a chronic tension headache that is migraine like in some ways and some days (like today) i can feel really ill, generally i am weak and tired and light headed and a bit nauseous. My memory and concentration is poor and it all seems to be related to however bad the tension in my head is; as it gets worse so do the other symptoms. It can be overwhelming. It 's never been as bad as it is right now and i 'm contemplating going to the hospital but i do n't know what they could do and i 'd be sat there for hours no doubt. Does this sound like chronic sinus migraine? That 's the main question. If anyone can relate to what i 'm saying that will reassure me somewhat and i 'll wait to see the doctor tomorrow. Thanks TJ######Btw i 've had full bloodworks, tried various medications and about every naturopathic remedy available and nothing has had any effect on the symptoms. Cured the sinusitis though!

I have observed that my fatigue is usually commensurate with my allergies/Rhinitis/sinusitis which is chronic and sometimes severe. I have taken various medications and treatments for my allergies including nasal steroids, OTC medications and prescription medications. These treatments have had varying degrees of success in alleviating my allergy symptoms, but my fatigue and headaches persist. I should also note that I sometimes experience parasomnia when lying supine. By far the best treatment for my allergies and sinusitis has been nasal irrigation via Neti Pot. Since I have been using it, I have seen a marked reduction in my fatigue and allergy related symptoms. All though my fatigue and headache have decreased in severity and frequency, it is still a major problem for me. Recently Iâ$ ve begun to wonder if I may have nasal polyps. In my research I have found evidence of a link between Nasal Polyps and chronic Fatigue, but most of this evidence is anecdotal. I have found one case study which links Chronic Fatigue to Nasal Polyps; Chronic fatigue cured by nasal surgery. Md Med J. 1993 Apr; 42 (4) :365 -7. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8515694 Besides dust and plant allergies, I also experience mid-facial pain, headache, post nasal drip, severe runny nose, excessive phlegm production, reduced sense of smell, frequent sinus infections, and sharp stabbing pains in the back of my throat; all of which I understand to be symptoms of nasal polyps. I have also been told that my nasal passages were somewhat narrow. What kind of test is used to confirm Polyps? Do nasal Polyps always show up in Endoscopy? Should I have a nasal CT performed? If so, what kind? Are there any doctors here on the forums who have cured chronic fatigue patients through nasal surgery?

As long as the joint is n't hot to the touch or visably red, moist heat from a warm wash cloth can ease some of the discomfort.

Thanks/ ARch######doctor can listen to your blood flow through the kidneys using a stethoscope and also order an ultrasound of the kidney######Hi Arch- Regarding your question about how to tell if high blood pressure is related to kidney problems: there are a few tests that can be done. First of all, there 's an IVP, which is basically an x-ray of your kidneys. This can show up some problems. Second, a doctor, preferably a nephrologist, should listen to the arteries leading to your kidneys (they pass over the groin area), to see if you have any bruits... these are sounds that are indicative of a problem with the blood circulation to your kidneys. If either of these (ivp, stethoscopic exam of kidney arteries) is positive, they would then probably want to follow up with a renal arteriogram. There may be other tests they can do, such as a creatinine clearance test, 24 hour urine sample, etc.. A nephrolgist, that is, a kidney specialist, would be the doctor to see. The kidneys are the organ most responsible for regulating blood pressure. There is a substance called renin which is produced by the kidneys to raise blood pressure if it 's too low. A condition called ``renal stenosis '', or a narrowing of the arteries leading to one or both kidneys, can cause blood to enter the kidney at a reduced rate, thus tricking the kidney into thinking you have low blood pressure. The kidney responds by producing extra renin to raise your blood pressure. This kind of high BP is not amenable to treatment with diet and exercise; medications must be used. The good news is that you can have this condition for years (as I have) and be fine as long as you control the high blood pressure. As far as I know, a protein urine test is for kidney functioning (i.e., filtering, etc.) and would not tell you anything about renal stenosis or an increased production of renin. You did n't say how old you are, Arch, or how high your BP is. If you 're much under 40, and especially if your diastolic (bottom) number is high, you should definitely have you kidneys checked out. Hope this has been of some help.

I do n't have HBP in the past, but it runs in my family (except my mom and I). It happened when I came for my annual checkup and the doctor realized my BP was over 180 and went up to 220 when I was admitted to ER right away. I did n't feel any headache, fatigue or blurry vision. The doctor checked urine, blood, and EKG test. Everything was normal, except I had very low potassium and high BP; so they released me when my BP reached 160. I 've been eating bananas, spinach, and yogurt (with high potassium) to boost my potassium level since then. I 'm 31 y.o., in an ideal weight (not obese) and currently being treated. My doctor asked me to stop taking BP meds that the ER prescribed me and my BP is still high (the last I went to the doctor, it was 180 and went down to 160 after 3 mins- I assume this is white coat hypertension). I also did the renin and some other test last week and would love to know the problem. I 'll go back to my doctor in 2 weeks or so for further examination.

But I have read that only somewhere between ten and twenty percent of people are even salt sensitive. Now if I knew for certain that I was one of those ten to twenty percent, it would n't bother me so much to cut out my beloved salt. But I ca n't help but think I just do n't want to sacrifice that much in taste for the next ten, twenty, forty years if I 'm not one of those affected by it anyway. But how can one really test if one is salt sensitive or not? My doctor said try taking blood pressure readings after eating salt and without salt. But it just is n't that easy! For me, and I 'm sure for many others, differences in stress and other factors would throw off those readings completely. I 'd probably have to go at least a month of no salt, then a month on exactly the same meals and snacks but with salt to get enough readings to average out other factors and make it at all meaningful. Has anyone had any experience in determining if you really are salt sensitive?######Hi Uff-Da, GREAT topic! Funny you should bring that up- it 's been on my mind too. I 've been reading that as many as 1/3 of people are low-renin hypertensives. For this lot, the drugs that work by lowering renin are not useful. That includes beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and ARBS. This minority owes hypertension to salt-sensitivity and so diuretics (and maybe calcium-channel blockers <not sure>) are the way to go, and of course the horrid and difficult no-salt diet. Obviously, if one's goal is monotherapy (one drug rather than 16), one MUST determine what 's causing the hypertension. Some clues I am putting together: 1. I retain MUCH more water weight than other people from a big salty day... as much as 7 pounds. 2. My BP soars when my weight does. 3. Thiazide diuretics lower my BP best and give brisk diuresis WHEN I 'm full of water (not otherwise) 4. ARB's do n't do much for me. I 've started experimenting first with a diuretic... then I 'll do only an ARB. I 'll keep you posted, but things are pointing me towards being in the minority. There 's some good stuff on the net about non-renin hypertension.######Keep in mind that for the other 2/3 that are high renin, ACE inhibitors and ARBs will block the renin-angiotensin system- essentially turning them into low-renin salt senisitive individuals as well. Pal######I 'm on Lisinopril. So, if I understand you correctly, on that medication I 'm salt-sensitive whether I was originally or not. No! I am not liking this! I was hoping for a way out!######Pal, So to follow your statement to it 's logical conclusion, treating the angiotensin II-renin (and ultimately aldosterone) system really benefits nobody if the 2/3 high renin hypertensitives become low-renin salt sensistives. Thus only the low renin, sodium sensitives have any hope for monotherapy. Do I read you correctly? Do you have any guesses on what the mechanism might be for hypertension in the ``salt-sensitives '': genetic, pituitary, adrenal, other?######Here 's a couple more articles supporting the fact that you become sodium sensitive while on an ACEI or ARB: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_u ids = 3103761 & dopt = Abstract- This one is from 1987. It was a little study that clearly shows that sodium restriction helps out an ACEI. http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/5/1042- And, here is very good article from 1995. It compares a low sodium diet to HCTZ while on an ACEI. It concludes that the two yeild similar blood pressure control. But, it prefers the low sodium diet because it does n't affect potassium levels. Pal######Thanks Pal, I 'll digest the links in the wee hours. One thing seems certain, though: to treat a low renin hypertensive with ARB's and ACE's and Beta Blockers seems a disastrously wrong approach and can only make matters worse. I guess the first order of business seems to test the plasma renin in the absence of meds. I gather, from the little I 've gleaned, that the testing is neither cheap nor common. There 's a long interview with a Dr. Joseph Laragh (qualifications too many to mention) floating around the web. That sheds lots of light on the subject.######I did read (well ok scan) the stress.org article and found it interesting. How can one determine if renin is the underlying cause? Are there tests that can be performed? If so, what are the treatment options?######I am going to try to get my plasma renin measured the next time I see my GP. I 'm presuming that a week beforehand without the meds will be a sufficient ``wash out '' period. I know the article talks about the difficulty of the two applicable tests, but I think the science is good enough so that my insurance company will pick up the tab. My take on the treatment is that high renin people should continue to block angiotensin the best way they can: ACES <cough cough> and$$ ARBS$$. The low renin hypertensives should go with the thiazides or other diuretics.######I remember reading somewhere that it took 2-4 weeks washout. And, your sodium intake had to be controlled for a few days before the test. And, it said something about needing to take an initial blood draw after resting for a couple hours. Then, another after standing for a couple hours. I can see why this test is seldom done. Dr. Laragh makes it sound like it 's just a simple blood test that everyone should have done. This is a lot more involved than the traditional 8-12 hour fasting rule for most other tests. Pal######This website describes the renin test (url) http://my.webmd.com/hw/hypertension/hw203228.asp[/url] I 'm editing the part about drawing blood. Renin Test Overview Renin is an enzyme produced by specific cells in the kidneys. Renin interacts with aldosterone (a hormone produced by the adrenal glands) and several other substances to help regulate sodium and potassium in the blood, fluid levels in the body, and blood pressure. A renin test, or plasma renin activity (PRA) test, is done to determine the cause of high blood pressure (hypertension). It is usually done at the same time as an aldosterone test (see the medical test Aldosterone). In some situations, it may be normal to have high blood levels of both renin and aldosterone. However, if renin levels are low and aldosterone levels are high, an aldosterone-producing tumor of the adrenal glands may be present. This test is usually done on a blood sample taken from a vein. Why It Is Done A plasma renin activity test is done to determine the cause of high blood pressure (hypertension), especially when potassium levels in the blood are low. How To Prepare For about 2 to 4 weeks before the test, you will have to stop taking medications that can interfere with the test, such as diuretics, birth control pills, and high blood pressure medications (especially beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors). Talk to your doctor about which medications you need to stop taking. Your doctor may substitute your medications with others that will not interfere with the renin blood test results. Do not eat natural black licorice for at least 2 weeks before the test, and avoid eating or drinking foods containing caffeine the day before the test. Natural licorice and caffeine can interfere with test results. Recent diagnostic imaging procedures that required the use of a radioactive tracer (such as a thyroid scan or bone scan) can interfere with renin test results. Inform your doctor if you have undergone any test within 3 days that used a radioactive tracer. For 3 days before a renin test, you may be required to follow a special diet that contains known amounts of sodium. How It Is Done You may need to sit or lie down for 1 to 2 hours before your blood is collected. In addition, a second blood sample may be collected after you stand for 2 hours. edited here ------- Results The results depend upon the time of day and your position (standing, sitting, or lying down) before the blood sample is collected, your age, and the level of sodium in your blood. Normal Normal values may vary from lab to lab. Plasma renin activity Adult (upright position, normal sodium diet): 1 6 nanograms per milliliter per hour (ng/mL/hr) Greater-than-normal values may mean A high renin value can indicate kidney disease, blockage of an artery leading to a kidney, Addison's disease, cirrhosis, excessive bleeding (hemorrhage), or malignant high blood pressure. Lower-than-normal values may mean A low renin value can indicate Conn's syndrome. What Affects the Test A diet high in natural black licorice can lower renin values. Many medications used to treat high blood pressure can raise or lower renin levels. Your position (standing, sitting, or lying) before the test is done or the time of day when the blood sample is drawn, as well as recent salt intake, can affect renin levels. Very high doses of corticosteroids can lower renin values. Pregnancy causes renin levels to increase. Rough handling, contamination, or inadequate refrigeration of the blood sample can cause inaccurate test results. What To Think About Many factors can affect renin test results. Therefore, only a doctor who has experience with renin tests should interpret the results. A renin stimulation test may occasionally be done if blood renin levels are low. To prepare for this test, you will follow a low-sodium diet for 3 days. A blood renin level will then be drawn and a diuretic, usually furosemide (Lasix), will be injected through an IV. Normally, blood renin levels will increase, whereas in Conn's syndrome blood renin levels will not change. A plasma renin activity (PRA) test measures renin indirectly by measuring an enzyme called angiotensin I rather than renin itself. Many hospitals now measure renin activity directly through a test called the renin direct immunoassay, which measures the amount of renin in the blood. A renin direct immunoassay is easier to do and can generally be substituted for the PRA test. However, in some situations (such as pregnancy), PRA results may be more accurate than the renin direct immunoassay.######Well, I guess that makes up my mind for me. There is no way in Hades that my GP will ever be able to get the testing for renin right. I routinely get lab results that say something like: Unable to test for <balh blah> because the sample was not centrifuged properly, or the red blood cells remained in contact with <blah blah> too long, or the sample was n't properly refrigerated. I clearly need a new < blah blah! > because mine is vaguely incompetent!######I was just sitting here watching an old war movie, & i had a bag of ACT II diet popcorn, figured not much fat I took my blood pressure when the movie was over, still sitting relaxed, and my bp was 157/109, 10 minutes later i checked & it was 156/102, its been 145/low 90's all day this is probably 30- 45 minutes after i finished the popcorn i looked at the box & each bag has 680 mg of sodium maybe it does make a difference, but then i havent had any salt that i know of all week, ive been eating mostly food i made from scratch myself######If it were me, I 'd be inclined to think the movie would probably have a greater influence than the salt. I know for a fact that my blood pressure is greatly influenced by stress. And watching a war movie would do it. Even watching the news, which is usually bad, does it. Just eating anything tends to raise the blood pressure, too, so I 'd think one would have to compare eating foods with salt and eating the same food without salt.######Come to think of it, I have one bag of ACT II diet popcorn left in the cupboard that I bought a long time ago.

She 's as high as 200/110. However, her resting BP is usually 120/80. How dangerous is it to be at 200/110, albeit for a few minutes? Is n't this a strong stroke risk? Also, what kind of medication should she be on, if any? Apparently, she was taking Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for Hypertension before. Should n't she be on something like Lisinopril or Micardis 20mg? HCTZ seems to be a diuretic drug that also reduces hypertension. The question is: if you have someone whose hypertension is very intense but infrequent, should n't that person still be taking medication? Does n't taking the medication long-term tend to lower BP even at brief moments of stress?######Yes. Her BP is soaring into stroke range. I 'd think that especially given how low her resting BP is that she should be very concerned about her condition. Any episode that launches your BP that high can cause you to stroke out, die or have brain damage.

Did you mean to say you have HYPOtension? The only thing I 've seen mentioned about fainting and low blood pressure is a situation where a person with low blood pressure has been sitting/squatting for a long period of time and suddenly stands. You can lessen the possiblility of fainting by getting up and stretching or walking every few minutes if you 're going to be seated for a while. Also, rising slowly and giving your body a chance to adjust to the new bloodflow will help. Standing causes a sudden drop in blood pressure because the blood goes to the lower extremities. This happens for all people. In those with normal or high BP, the body sends a signal for the heart to pump faster... to compensate for the change in blood flow. For people with low BP, the body does n't send this signal and fainting can occur..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Low Blood Pressure and Hypotension

Any clue why its so high ??######I got type 1 diabetes, and i got a ``condition '' called Dawn Phenomenon (about 80% of all diabetics do, if I remember correctly). It 's when your body produces growth hormone which increases the body's resistance to insulin. In some people it can start as early as 10 pm and sometimes lasts to 10 am (which it does with me). I 'm am higly resistant to insulin at night and I am very sensitive to insulin after about 12 am (which leads to poorly regulated diabetes). So I almost always have too high blood sugar in the morning (it 's almost always about 12- 14 mmol/L, 216- 252 mg/dl). Here is a link for you to read about it (url) http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/article.cfm?aid=1023[/url] Take care######The other thing I would like to mention is to be very careful to have clean hands when you test your sugar. This can throw your reading way off. It takes very little contaminant in the small drop of blood being tested to alter the result significantly.######Everyone has dawn phenomenon. It is your body's way of preparing for the day. At some time during the night or early morning your body puts out glucose so that there will be energy available when you get up. For some people it is only a mild elevation and for others it is quite significant. Because it is only an issue for people with diabetes, it is often mentioned in conjuction with diabetes, but everyone has it to some extent or another. Cora######Tinkerbell, Were you at one time hypoglycemic? Just curious, because hypoglycemia is often a precursor to T2 diabetes, and I was thinking that if in fact you had been, maybe your blood sugar actually went too low at sometime during the night, triggering your liver to release glycogen to raise the blood sugar. This is called ``rebound effect '' and causes high blood sugar in the am. Even if you were n't ever hypoglycemic, try setting your alarm for around 3 AM and testing your blood sugar at that time. If it 's quite low (below 60, especially), then what you 're experiencing is rebound, and the way to prevent it is to have a light snack before bedtime. Ruth######Yes, that 's true. But not everyone with diabetes has problems with it, becuase it 's not so severe in everyone, as i said about 80% have minor to greater problems with it. So i only metioned it, so she could look it up to see maybe her cause to why her blood sugar was high in the morning, as the question was..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Diabetes is a disease wherein the body fails to manufacture or properly use insulin.Insulin is an agent of the blood sugars that is used as a source of energy throughout the body.Although the liver uses insulin for the storage of glycogen, a processed form of glucose. In a person with Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or the insulin that is produced does not work properly, and the sugars are not able to get into some of the cells.######There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes is sometimes called insulin-dependent, immune-mediated or juvenile-onset diabetes. It is caused by an auto-immune reaction where the bodyâ$ s defence system attacks the insulin-producing cells. The reason why this occurs is not fully understood. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually occurs in children or young adults. People with this form of diabetes need injections of insulin every day in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood. If people with type 1 diabetes do not have access to insulin, they die. Type 2 diabetes is sometimes called non-insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes do not usually require injections of insulin. Usually, they can control the glucose in their blood by watching their diet, taking regular exercise, oral medication, and possibly insulin. Type 2 diabetes is most common in people older than 45 who are overweight. However, as a consequence of increased obesity among the young, it is becoming more common in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes. If people with type 2 diabetes are not diagnosed and treated, they can develop serious complications, which can result in an early death. Worldwide, many millions of people have type 2 diabetes without even knowing it. Others do not have access to adequate medical care. The onset of type 2 diabetes is also linked to genetic factors but obesity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet increase the risks. Some women develop a third, usually temporary, type of diabetes called â$ gestational diabetesâ$ when they are pregnant. Gestational diabetes develops in 2-5% of all pregnancies, but usually disappears when the pregnancy is over. Women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on.

Please help!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes######For the past few months my hubby has not been himself. He is tired all the time, and since mid December has been constantly thirsty. He ca n't get enough to drink. Several trips throughout the day to the bathroom, (but would n't that be from all the liquids he drinks?) His vision goes blurry, he gets very shakey, and sometimes he says he feels like he is going to pass out. No energy. While shopping last night I picked up a blood glucose test meter. We waited until this morning to do the test. He did n't have anything to eat or drink for 9 hours so we could get the proper results. The meter came up with ``510 ''. The test said if it is below 20 or higher then 600 a warning would appear letting him know it was too low or too high. We do n't know what a normal level should be. The test does n't really tell us. We did the test again about an hour after he ate lunch and it was ``471 ''. I did the test also to see what would happen and mine said ``80 '' in the morning and ``105 '' after lunch. He is 54 years old and NEVER been to a family Dr. because of not having any health insurance.Today I called all over to find a Dr. that will accept new patients without insurance. After 3 hrs. I found one who made an appt. but not until March 25. I even explained how worried I am about him. No one seemed to care. If he would of had insurance, they would have glady seen him. Can someone please tell us what a normal reading should be and your opinions on his symptoms? Thank you!######I do n't mean to scare you. But I would STRONGLY suggest you take your husband to a hospital emmergency room IMMEDIATELY. A lot of his other blood chemistries could also be out of whack and life threatening. It is possible that he may just get sent home with a prescription for glyburide, but please, you are better safe than sorry. These numbers are life threatening from what I understand. Please do not wait for the dr's appt. Go to the hospital. His numbers are extremely high. Anything above 126 is abnormal and these are life threatening values, again, from what I understand.######Normal is more in the range you saw on yourself, a bit higher would also be normal. In terms of symptoms, frequent urination is a symptom. I am not a Dr but my understanding is that where your blood sugar is too high, your kidneys try to dump some of the sugar out through urine. So you pee a lot. This dehydrates you and you are thirsty. I do n't know if you measured properly but if so, 510 and 471 would be very high. Can you continue looking for another doctor sooner? Is there not another medical service you can get help with?######I agree with Uma... your husband should go to the nearest emergency room. With blood sugars running that high, he could be in diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. While there, ask if he would qualify for uncompensated care (most hospitals have a fund to help take care of people who do n't have health insurance and are in financial straits but still need urgent medical care.) A non-diabetic's blood sugars would never go that high, even after eating a high-carb meal. Normal range is between 70 and 140, never higher. Your husband is definitely diabetic... question is, whether it 's type 1 or type 2, and the only way to tell is through some blood tests. Ruth######Yes, that would indicate diabetes, probably type 2, given his age, meaning he has resistance to his own insulin. He needs to see a doctor or go to the hospital asap to get his blood glucose in control. Normal blood glucose is between 70 and 120, so 520 is very high. Meters read ``HI '' when over 600, but that warning is just indicating extremely severe highs. Good luck, and do not let this slide so as to prevent any complications.######Finally talked hubby into going to the ER instead of waiting for Dr. appt. He does have type 2 diabetes. He did n't have any ketones which they said was a good thing. His glucose level while we were there was 296. They gave him a prescription for Metaformin. They set him up with a follow-up Dr. for this Thursday. I just want to thank e `one for telling me he should go to the ER. I was really scared for him. He 's been on the med. for 2 days but his numbers are still in the 200's. Anyone have any idea how long this med. takes to start working? Thank you all again!######Everyone is different but met can take weeks to kick in full effect. If I remember well they said as much as 4 to 6 weeks. When I started it was n't doing anything and I read it COULD take several weeks. It will slowly start to make a difference. Was it his morning levels that were so bad or after eating? In the mean time, go easy on the carbs and drink lots of water.######Not really sure if he is overweight, but probably is. . He is 6 ' 1 '' and weighs 255 pounds He 's gained 25 pounds since Sept' 07. Thats when he quit smoking (cold turkey) and took up eating candy. . tons of it! Around Nov./ Dec. is when he started feeling really bad. . (But since not feeling well he 's been losing weight) The ER did n't give us a diet plan or anything to follow before his Dr. appt. on Thursday, so I had to go online and look it up. I know the med. is making him even more sicker to his stomach, cramps, and diarrhea. I guess thats a normal side effect from what I have read about it and just to stick with it because you will feel worse before you get better ??? His reading this morning before breakfast was 189, the lowest it 's been since we started monitoring it a few days ago. Exercise. . yes, my hubby wants the both of us to start going for walks. We will ask the Dr. about it first. He 's a bricklayer and ca n't wait for spring to settle in so he can return to work. But mostly, all he keeps saying is. . ``I hope I get better ''. He 's very worried about not having insurance and not being able to work if he does n't get feeling better. Hopefully things will work out somehow.######If he is in fact Type2, the metformin will start having an effect after about 3 weeks. But if he is Type1, metformin wo n't do him any good and he will steadily get worse. The fact that the onset has been so quick, blood sugars of 500 + have been recorded, and he has lost weight suggest that it could be Type1. So watch it carefully.######He was diagnosed with type 2.######Sheila, From what I have heard and read, the side effects from metformin do go away after a while, but if they become intolerable, the best way to manage is to start from the beginning, with a very small dose, and then increase it gradually over a period of several weeks. Do n't know how much he 's taking, so ca n't tell if he 's on a large dose already or not. This is something you can work out with his doctor. Ruth######Thank you Ruth. He is on 500mg, 3 times a day.######There are people who 's pancreas produces no insulin. They are type 1. There are people who produce insulin but their body does n't use it well. They are type 2. And there are people in between who do n't produce quite enough or who 's body barely make due with what they produce. There are people borderline between the two. The progression of one to another sometimes occurs with age Doctors will try and use metformin and if your husband does n't get good control, they will try other medications and may eventually prescribe the use of insulin. Metformin is usually the first attempt. If it does n't work, there are several other weapons in the arsenal. I guess theoretically the minute you use insulin you are type 1. NIDDM is ``non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus '' (type2). IDDM is ``insulin depenant diabetes mellitus '' (type 1). I does n't really matter if he is type 1 or 2. The important thing is for him to get control, and if to do so, means insulin injections, so be it. They are not the end of the world, just think of them as a different form of medication. But for now, listen to the Dr. Metformin does a couple of things. I allows the insulin your husband has (assuming he is producing some) more efficiently. It also reduces the amount of sugar his liver produces. If he is responding to metformin, the chances are he does have some insulin production left. If it 's enough is to be determined. But remember, if not, insulin injections are not the end of the world. I hope this info helps. If it 's just annoying, let me know######I feel the need to correct a misconception here. Type1 Diabetes and Type2 Diabetes are clinically diseases and need to be treated in different ways. Type1 is an autoimmune disorder, whereas Type2 is the result of insulin resistance. While you ca n't progress from the one to the other, it is possible to have both Type1 and Type2 at the same time. The problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between them in the early stages, and Type 1 is often mis-diagnosed as Type 2. If the diagnosis was not based on insulin level and antibody test results, it could be wrong. As I mentioned in the previous post, normal weight, weight loss and very high blood glucose readings suggest that this could be the case. The fact there were no ketones could just mean that the pancreas is still producing enough insulin to stop this from happening. But things change fast in the onset of T1. And treating Type1 with type2 oral medications accelerates onset of the disease. Most importantly, these medications wo n't stop the development of ketoacidosis, which is dangerous condition. This is why it needs to be watched carefully at this stage.######Could n't have said it better myself, Mark! Also, even if T2 progresses to the point where one is insulin-dependent (as I am), it is STILL T2, not T1. It 's just T2 with a completely worn-out pancreas. Ruth######Unfortunately not all doctors and litterature use the terms the way you do. Some refer to type 1 as insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 as non insulin dependent (NIDDM). They seem to classify the result, i.e ``do I need insulin ''. You have classified them, as some doctors and litterature by the underlying issue, ie deterioration of the beta cells in the pancreas vs deterioration of the bodies ability to use insulin, that may lean to a burn out of insulin production. In your language, is IDDM type 1 and NIDDM type 2 or are those terms meaningless?######No, Type1 is not equal to IDDM and Type2 is not equal to NIDDM. And yes, it is unfortunate that the terminology has become so confusing. I think it highlights the shortcomings of defining a disease by its symptomatic characteristics. It makes much more sense to define a disease in terms of what causes it. But up until the 1970's, the distinction between the respective causes of what we now know as Type1 and Type2 diabetes were not well understood. So it was easier to call them IDDM and NIDDM. The terms Juvenile Onset Diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes were used for similar reasons. Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years. It is not uncommon for young people to become insulin resistant and for older people to have an autoimmune attack on their beta cells. It is also common for someone with insulin resistance to lose all beta cell function and become totally dependent on injected insulin (like Ruth). Also consider that an insulin dependent T2 is not the same as a T1 (who is also insulin dependent). The presence of insulin resistance means that additional treatment options may have to be considered. The net effect is that those old terms have lost their descriptive exclusivity. This is why usage of the IDDM/NIDDM and Juvenile/Maturity Onset Diabetes terminology has been superseded by ``Type1 '' and ``Type2 '' diabetes. These terms are both well understood in terms of the respective etiology, and the risk of mis-diagnosis has been brought into focus. This is what I was commenting on in the earlier post. It is easy to misdiagnose a T1 as T2 in the early stages. Doctors still use age and size as diagnostic guidelines and do n't do the required tests. Use of the old terms, IMO, is not helpful and just causes a lot of confusion. Mark######To highlight the lack of clarity, this from the definition page of the canadian diabetes association. (url) http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/dictionary.asp[/url] TYPE 1 DIABETES (or insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas no longer produces any or very little insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar as an energy source. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and affects 10% of people with diabetes. TYPE 2 DIABETES (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs or the insulin is not metabolized effectively. Type 2 usually occurs later in life and affects 90% of people with diabetes..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Just found out that my two sisters have diabetes, and hoping I do n't. Can someone tell me what your first symptoms were of diabetes. My sister said that she would get hot and sweaty and could n't lose weight.######Hot, sweaty, and not able to lose weight are not symptoms of diabetes. Weight loss, palore, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue are symptoms.######Okay thanks, I thought that not being able to lose weight was not one of the symptoms.######Lady50, I read in a Diabetes journal that there is a connection between Diabetes and NOT being able to lose weight. I know for myself, I tried different approaches to losing weight but did n't get results. Since recently being told I 'm Diabetic I started to watch my carb intake and carb mixtures for the past month to have control of my sugar numbers and already seen a reduction in my weight. It may be more of eating a healthier low carb diet but I also think since my sugar is at a steady pace- it 's easier for me to get the weight off. \* I also do get hot and sweaty but I 'm 46- that 's just plain ol' mother nature. PollyAnn######The not being able to lose weight may be what causes Type 2, but it is definitely not a symptom of diabetes. When you have diabetes, you are n't able to properly use carbohydrates for energy, so you urinate them out. This basically results in your peeing out your number 1 energy source, forcing your body to burn fat rapidly. Therefore, weight loss is a symptom.######Thats not exactly it but close. The Problem comes from No Insulin. Type 1 Diabetics will ofton see the weight loss but Type2's usually wont. When there is not any insulin in the body at all the body cant do many things, Insulin is responsible for Moving Glucos from the Blood stream to where it is needed. Which includes to Glycogen for energy and to fat for storage. Without any insulin the body also cant rebuild muscle as it gets broken up when used. So you end up losing tons of muscle. Unfortunately many Type 2 Diabetics actually do not experience any symptoms at all.######I visited a Diabetes Support group and the first thing I noticed was that everyone there was overweight. My thoughts were `is this the way I 'm heading with my Diabetes'. I have about 25lbs to lose but these people were a lot heavier. I went to gain knowledge from others that are in the same boat but at first I felt a little odd. Everyone was very nice, had different types of Diabetes and ranged in all ages. There was a 13-year-old girl who takes insulin and even she was overweight. Does insulin cause you to gain weight? I also learned from this group that most everyone has other serious issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure and lung problems. And the women in the late 40's age said they were dealing with Menopause symptoms and think possibly that Diabetes is making the symptoms worst for both their Diabetes and Menopause. It was n't the place for me but it 's nice that there are such place for support.######I agree type 2 diabetics do n't always show weight loss or any symptoms at all, but I do n't believe only people with type 1 experience weight loss. My pathophysiology text book lists weight loss as a symptoms for both types. Type 1s will lose more weight for the reasons you mentioned, but they will overall have more symptoms since their blood sugar will raise at a much more rapid pace. Once blood sugars reach over 180, most people will be peeing out glucose, since that is generally the renal threshold for glucose.######Thank you all so much. I have another question, hope ya all do n't mind. Right now I am like dead broke, and wanted to get a diabetes test since 2 sisters of mine have it. I was thinking of going to the local Health Department and get a finger \*\*\*\*\* blood sugar test. Do you think this test would detect diabetes in me. If your bloodsugar is quite high, does that mean diabetes. I have read that urinalysis is a good test, since there should be no sugar in the urine. This finger \*\*\*\*\* bloodtest will only cost me 3 bucks.######correction: should have said finger poke instead of the other word.LOLLOL######If both your sisters have it, I would think the easiest way to detect it would be asking one of them to test you. If it 's high, my suggestion to you is to get health insurance before you get diagnosed by a doctor.######It 's all very confusing to me. I thought Diabetes I was when your body ca n't produce insulin at ALL. that 's why it has to be injected. Type II diabetes is totally different and it 's not insulin that they 're taking by pill form. the medication they take by pill form helps regualte their blood sugar in type II. Insulin ca n't be produced in pill form. only with injection. type II can be cured by changing the diet. It 's proven. It 's very technical and can be down right confusing. hypoglycemia, vs reactive hypoglycemia is different from eachother too. I need a good book to describe and illistrate to me in detail what each one is. in laymans terms or dummy form like they make dummy books for computers. the longer I go with having low blood sugar attacks, the worst my being able to understand anything in an orderly fashion is diminishing. it 's very frustrating. maybe there 's a book out there in the market for me. anyone have any suggestions? Linda######There are several types of diabetes. type 1- the immune system attacks it 's own pancreas. This results in the insulin producing cells no longer being able to produce insulin. The blood glucose raises rapidly and dangerously. As no insulin is present, external insulin must be provided through injection or a pump. type 2- this is a bit more complicated. In type two, for some reason, the cells stop responding to the insulin being produced. Basically, insulin acts as the gatekeeper for the cells, allowing glucose to enter the body cells. Think of it as the gatekeeper falling asleep on the job. To make up for this, ``reinforcements '' are sent in. The body just keeps making more insulin so blood glucose can be maintained at a somewhat normal level, though the level does raise. Eventually, the body ca n't make any more insulin, so lack of insulin production becomes a sign of type 2 at some point in time. Gestational- basically in this one, the fetus takes all the glucose away from mom's body. So mom's body tries to not store glucose, but keep it all in the blood instead. The glucose raises. Also, some resistance is present due to the added weight. MODY- maturity onset diabetes of youth. This is a rare genetic form of diabetes. Basically, the body is born not being able to make enough insulin (but it makes some), and it gets worse with age. Diet and exercise can be used at first, then meds, then insulin. LADA- latent onset autoimmune diabetes of adults. Think of this as an adult getting Type 1. It 's a form of type 1 diabetes, but the onset is slower and at an older age.######update: My sister checked my bloodsugar with the finger poke bloodtester. Before I ate, it was 140, after eating it was 117. A few hours later, it dropped down to 57. This is when I was feeling a bit shakey inside.Then I was craving sweets like mad. This is weird that it dropped so low.######Sounds like reactive hypoglycemia.######Thank you for helping me with this. I will be looking that up..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I 'm not diabetic, but a good friend of mine has become diabetic, and I 'm tryin to help him out... So... If a non diabetic person can get into ketosis gradually, by elimination of all carbos from the diet and stay indefinately in a ketogenic state without glucose or endogenous insulin production, why could n't a diabetic person ?? Would n't this eliminate a lot of the long term health problems caused by diabetese ?? I realize it would take a diabetic person constant and precise glucose monoriting and precision insulin control for a few weeks to gradually get into ketosis without starving the brain of glucose before ketones were present in sufficient quanity to no longer require glucose. Is this impossible for a diabetic or am I missing any other important issues here ?? If acidity of the blood were the main problem, could n't this condition be corrected with medication that would have less serious health related side effects than the inprecise administeration of exodegenous insulin along with the typical fluctuations of high and low glucose levels of a diabetic person ?? Below is part of an article I recently read to clear up any questions that pertain to ketosis- vs- ketoacidosis. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Dietary ketosis is among the most maligned and misunderstood concepts in nutrition because it is often confused with ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition most often associated with uncontrolled insulin-deficient Type 1 diabetes. In the Type 1 diabetic, the absence of insulin leads to a toxic build-up of blood glucose and an extreme break-down of fat and muscle tissue. This condition does n't occur in individuals who have even a small amount of insulin, whether from natural production or artificially administered. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* I have a lot more info and questions, but I had to start somewhere. Thanks, MAXS######Sorry but the article is incorrect. In that it says that the body having even a little insulin will not enter ketoacidosis. ``This condition does n't occur in individuals who have even a small amount of insulin, whether from natural production or artificially administered. '' It is very wrong. Type one diabetics that go into ketoacidosis most always have insulin in their bodies. And I have been in DKA 6 times so I know of what I speak. Ketosis is not the same. But when you enter that stage the body feeds off of itself, which is the goal to loose weight. But ketoacidosis does the same thing but it also eats muscle material after the fat is low. The diet under control can work. But it can not be done in the same manner as a non diabetic. You can and will enter diabetic ketoacidosis if it is not watched closely. The same problem I have had for 30 plus years is having non diabetics trying to cure or fix problems in a diabetic when they do not understand the intricacies of the control of the disease. Again the diet under close control can and does work. But not in the same manner as a non Diabetic body. Ketosis is not DKA, but it can help place the body into DKA. You have to be spilling ketenes for this to work. If you are spilling ketenes, you have built them up in your system. If they are built up in your system then the danger is available. Anytime ketenes are medium or high under any circumstances a diabetic enters DKA. It can not be avoided, because it is DKA. That is the state we are trying to avoid. So that is why we avoid this diet as it is written for non diabetics. It should be rewritten for us. But it will have many circumstances to watch out for. Danger can enter quickly if it is not under close control. So the risk by its very nature is not worth the usage of the diet. Unless you can manage your care with great control with extremely good numbers, I would not recommend it to that person without them being under great self control of sugars, A1C s.. It is a dangerous diet without good control. My brother is on the diet. He does not have Diabetes. I know the goals and diet. I loose weight by cutting down on carbs. But not cutting them out completely. It works with similar ideas. Just not as drastic.######Well dwpavlik, You have to understand, my friend has only recently been diagnosed with diabetes. You, on the other hand have had 30 years first hand experience dealing with the disease. You obvously have the time, desire, etc to research and have educated yourself through the years on the subject. Not all diabetic people have your knowlege on the subject. I am attempting to educate myself on the subject so as to verbally pass it along to my friend, who is a 42yo father of two, with a daily schedule that does n't allow the time to educate himself on the subject. For example, he has never heard the term, glycemic index, and I see his eating habits. You state: ``The same problem I have had for 30 plus years is having non diabetics trying to cure or fix problems in a diabetic when they do not understand the intricacies of the control of the disease. '' By your above statement, every non diebetic research scientist working on a cure for diabetes should not be researching diabetes, or their work should be invalidated because they are in fact non diabetic themselves. Come on dude, I 'm just trying to educate myself, to pass into my friend, who knows VERY little, even less than I do about his disease. I DO NOT claim to know anything about diabetes, just attempting to learn and discuss some of my ideas, IE: this diabetes discussion board. Another article I read on ketosis- vs- ketoacidosis is below, and seems to contradict some of what you are saying. Please, I am not trying to question or challenge your knowledge, just trying to get a more complete picture on the intricacies of this disease. I appreciaty your sharing your knowlege and opinion. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Ketosis is a negative catch word for many people. The only reason can possibly be that they 're confusing it with diabetic ketoacidosis. But look how diametrically opposed they are. Ketoacidosis occurs in Type I diabetes, meaning it occurs because of an insulin absence or an insulin deficiency. Benign ketosis is achieved in overweight subjects whose metabolism is characterized by the fact that they put out too much insulin. Ketoacidosis is caused by an increased intake of carbohydrate, benign ketosis by a decreased intake of carbohydrate. There is, of course, acidosis in ketoacidosis, but in benign dietary ketosis the pH is 10 normal. There is no acidosis. In ketoacidosis, patients are extremely symptomatic, and in ketosis the subjects describe an improvement in well being. Now, that 's pretty different. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* So please bear with me... is n't ketoacidosis a state of high blood ketone levels ALONG WITH high levels of glucose ?? If NO glucose were present in the blood of a diabetic person, regardless of how this condition was attained, along with an adequate level of ketones to fuel the brain, and the person did not consume ANY carbohydrates, why could this state not be carried on indefinately without having to administer exodgenous insulin ?? Consuming ANY anount of carbs while ketogenic would probably induce ketoacidosis in a type2 diebetic ?? Also if no glucose were present, would n't this eliminate the possibility of acidosis ?? Or Would a diabetic person be healthier on a very low amount of low glycemic carbs, taken in evenly, say 5 grams of carbs per meal, 5 times per day, along with protein and fats, for a total of 25 grams carbs per day, along with a corresponding reduction in insulin intake? I am NOT promoting any change to any diabetic persons diet without an endrocologist's or doctor's supervision as even I understand this could prove potentially fatal. Thanks, MAXS (This message has been edited by MAXS (edited 09-04-2003) .) (This message has been edited by MAXS (edited 09-04-2003) .)######OK sorry for being a little grumpy What you are doing is commendable. I have had bad experiences with helpers of trying to cure me. Again sorry, that was my pet peeve. Anyone can study and learn about diabetic care. What we are told by the Endo's is that we understand our ailments better than they can. Not educated better, But understand it better. So we work together with the Endo's and get the best of both worlds. I did mention that the diet does work in close control and not allowed to be actuated in full ketosis. We have to keep our body clear of having Ketenes in our blood or it will cause a problem. Low blood glucose is also dangerous to diabetics. This can cause brain damage if the level is allowed to remain too low over a period of time. An example of ketoacidosis in me in all cases I was taking insulin every day above 40 units of insulin per day. I acquired ketoacidosis anyway. As long as Ketenes are being spilled, there is always a danger of ketoacidosis. There is no contrary diabetic study to prove otherwise in this described situation. This is the point I was making. This is where the tight control needs to be taken. The article is misleading about diabetic dieters. It is not misleading about normal non diabetic dieters.######Dr Atkins new diet book talks of the benefits of a ketosis diet for diabetics his diet is helping me a lot with my weight problem and diabetes control######Hey hry33, Would you care to share any details with us such as any problems you have experienced such as ketoacidosis, are you total carb elimination or just low carbs, if low carbs, you eat low glycemic or do n't worry, amount of exodgenous insulin administration reduction from previous diet to the atkins type diet? How long you been on this diet? Am I correct in assuming that most long term health problems caused by being diabetic are actually caused by lack of control (fluctuations) in glucose levels or too high glucose levels? If so, this is why I am thinking that very low or no glucose levels would possibly be a long term health benifit over fluctuating and or high glucose levels. To anyone diabetic possibly reading this thinking no or low blood glucose equals coma or death, this is not true in a NON DIABETIC person. As I understand, two things can fuel the brain of a non diabetic, glucose or ketones. Anyone know if this different in a diabetic person? MAXS######Max- I 'm far from an expert, but am fairly well-read and unfortunately very experienced when it comes to diabetes, and I wanted to add two points: First, it 's my understanding that the brain absolutely needs glucose to function, and that if one's blood sugar goes low enough for long enough, one would suffer some brain damage, if not death. I believe this is true whether or not one is diabetic; but it 's much more likely to happen in an insulin-dependent diabetic. DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS is a condition where the blood glucose is HIGH and ketones are present. You are right that people who are not diabetic would probably not suffer harm from having ketones in their blood stream UNLESS they have undetected kidney disease. In that case, since the kidneys have to filter all the ketones, it could cause kidney failure. Second, it would be very nice to think that ``one size '' truly does fit all, but such is unfortunately not the case in clothing, nor is it the case in diets. I actually gained weight on the Atkins diet, possibly due to eating too much fat. However, I can tell you that if I had to stay on a low-fat Atkins diet, I 'd probably RATHER be dead, LOL! Okay... one more point. Most non-diabetics think that managing diabetes is simply a matter of eating right and exercising, with Type 1 diabetics adding a bit of insulin. But managing diabetes is very complicated. Many things can make your blood sugar go up or down, including stress (both bad AND good); illnesses such as viruses and infections, heart attacks, surgical procedures; certain medications; along with over/undereating and over/underexercising. In women, the onset of the monthly menstrual cycle frequently affects the blood glucose. And even if one gets it ``right '' for many weeks or months, sometimes one will experience a rising or lowering of blood glucose despite having made absolutely no changes in diet or exercise. All in all, it 's a very delicate balancing act, with diet being only one portion of the pie (you 'll pardon the expression, LOL). I think this is often why us diabetics tend to get our backs up when non-diabetics come up with ``solutions '' for us. Still, having said all that, I do think it 's commendable that you 're trying to learn more in an effort to help your friend. I would recommend reading a variety of books on diabetes and, if your friend does n't already subscribe, ``Diabetes Forecast '' is a monthly magazine put out by the American Diabetes Association. I 've learned a lot from it... not just from the articles, but also from the ``ask us '' column. (This message has been edited by SamQKitty (edited 09-05-2003) .)######Ketosis: Is it safe? Why do some people say it 's dangerous? On July 7, 2002, the New York Times published ``What if It 's All Been a Big Fat Lie? '' written by Gary Taubes. I quote the article: '' `Doctors are scared of ketosis, ' says Richard Veech, an N.I.H. (National Institutes of Health) researcher who studied medicine at Harvard and then got his doctorate at Oxford University with the Nobel Laureate Hans Krebs. '' They 're always worried about diabetic ketoacidosis. But ketosis is a normal physiologic state. '' ``Simply put, ketosis is evolution's answer to the thrifty gene. We may have evolved to efficiently store fat for times of famine, says Veech, but we also evolved ketosis to efficiently live off that fat when necessary. Rather than being poison, which is how the press often refers to ketones, they make the body run more efficiently and provide a backup fuel source for the brain. Veech calls ketones '' magic '' and has shown that both the heart and brain run 25 percent more efficiently on ketones than on blood sugar. '' You can read the full article at (url = ``http://www.nyt.com. '' ]www.nyt.com. (/ url) Being in ketosis means your body has burned a large amount of fat in response to the fact that it did n't have sufficient glucose available for energy needs. Under everyday conditions, the carbohydrates you eat are converted to glucose, which is the body's primary source of energy. Whenever your intake of carbohydrates is limited to a certain range, for a long enough period of time, you 'll reach a point where your body draws on its alternate energy system, fat stores, for fuel. This condition called dietary ketosis, means your body burns fat and turns it into a source of fuel called ketones. Ketones are produced whenever body fat is burned. When you burn a larger amount of fat than is immediately needed for energy, the excess ketones are discarded in the urine. Dietary ketosis is among the most maligned and misunderstood concepts in nutrition because it is often confused with ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition most often associated with uncontrolled insulin-deficient Type 1 diabetes. In the Type 1 diabetic, the absence of insulin leads to a toxic build-up of blood glucose and an extreme break-down of fat and muscle tissue. This condition does n't occur in individuals who have even a small amount of insulin, whether from natural production or artificially administered. Dietary ketosis, however, is a natural adjustment to the body's reduced intake of carbohydrates as the body shifts its primary source of energy from carbohydrates to stored fat. The presence of insulin keeps ketone production in check so that a mild, beneficial ketosis is achieved. Blood glucose levels are stabilized within a normal range and there is no break-down of healthy muscle tissue. The most sensitive tests of ketosis (``NMR '' and ``blood ketone level '') show that everyone is in some degree of ketosis every day, particularly after not eating overnight and after exercising. Ketosis is the body's survival system. It is not an abnormality nor does it present any medical danger, except to a Type I insulin-dependent diabetic. The body functions naturally and effectively while in a state of dietary ketosis. Some of the benefits many people experience while in a state of dietary ketosis for intentional weight loss may include rapid weight loss, decreased hunger and cravings, improved mood, increased energy and, as long as protein intake is adequate, protection of lean muscle mass.######I went to the Barnes & Noble book store today. I found an entire section dedicated to books on diabetes. I was amazed at the wildly conflicting opinions on whats best for a healthy diet for a diabetic person. I did however, find a book that promotes just about everything I have been asking about above, the book is: Diabetic Solution by Dr. Bernstein. He has been diabetic most of his life. He advocates close control (normalizing) of glucose levels is manditory for long term health. He also advocates a very low carb diet as a way to closley control glucose levels. His website has a message board where type2 diabetics claim to have given up diabetic meds from implementing his very low carb diet. Not a cure, but possibly a healthier life for some. Rigidly implementing any VERY restrictive diet is tough, but perhaps well worth the effort if it can eliminate the serious side effects that diabetese can cause. I have yet to read the book, so if I get any more unconvential diabetese info, I 'll post it later. Anyone read this book or tried the Diet ?? Any input ??######Hi, I definitely do n't consider myself an expert and I 'm fairly young here... so please do n't make fun of me. . heh heh. I 've been trying to figure this disease out for a long time now and have heard so many different things from different books, articles, and especially doctors. Everything I 've learned is actually from trial and error. I consider the whole thing frustrating at times because everything contradicts everything else. But anyways- Recently I put myself on the atkins diet... i lost 20 pounds so it was a success. However, I was recently advised by my doctors to go off the diet... so I did. I think one of the major issues here is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Being that your friend was just diagnosed with diabetes, I 'm going to assume that he has type 2 diabetes. . is this correct? The atkins diet would actually be very beneficial for your friend (or dr. bernstein's diet- any low carb diet really) without putting him at risk... I believe this strictly because a doctor recently told me that type 2 diabetics ca n't produce ketones, thus your friend should n't be at risk the way a type 1 diabetic would be. If anyone knows this to be true or false, please let me know though. It all happened when my mother displayed (about a month ago) all the symptoms of diabetes, and naturally because she 's 47, they automatically thought she had type 2 diabetes and gave her pills to take. Unfortunately they were very wrong- they 've discovered that many people of older age can still develope type 1 (which should no longer be named juvenile diabetes now). She nearly went into a come from this misdiagnosis because she was producing ketones and supposedly type 2 diabetics do n't produce them... she 's on insulin now though and everything is dandy. but anyways, that 's about all I have for now. I 'd love to hear anyone else's input on the topic.######Hi Breaking, Type 2 diabetics USUALLY do n't produce ketones, but there are some who do. One of the biggest misunderstandings in this country is that all Type2 diabetes is the same and can be controlled through diet and exercise, with sometimes a bit of oral medication. The fact is that Type 2 diabetes is a progressive illness. It 's caused by either or both of two factors: the pancreas does n't produce quite enough insulin and/or the body's tissues are insulin resistant. In either case, the pancreas works overtime to try to produce more insulin and can eventually wear itself out to the point of producing almost no insulin at all. Additionally, some people even when initially diagnosed have a ``worse '' case than others. For years, the only oral medications for Type 2 diabetes worked by prompting the pancreas to produce even more insulin, thereby wearing out the pancreas faster. So some of us Type 2's are now totally insulin dependent even though our bodies may produce a smidgen of insulin. For example, I do n't get ketones, but I 'm an insulin-dependent Type 2 on an insulin pump. There are Type 2's who are not as severe as I am, but who produce ketones if their blood glucose goes up. Max- I 've heard some great results from following Dr. Bernstein's plan. However, it should be noted that his plan is basically what they used to do to treat diabetics before the advent of insulin... they put them on a carb-free diet. Of course, even with no carbs, people would get very sick and many died. Now, with insulin available, it probably helps to minimize complications because by keeping carbohydrate intake low, one only needs to take enough insulin to cover one's basic metabolic needs. Some studies have shown that an over abundance of insulin is, in itself, detrimental to the body (causing increased fat storage, especially around the abdomen and possibly contributing to heart disease). So I think that, if one can stick to it, the Bernstein diet may make sense. However, again speaking as a long-time diabetic to non-diabetics... it 's very easy to say you 'd do whatever you had to do to stay healthy, including ALWAYS watching every morsel of food you eat, NEVER eating things that are ``bad '' for you, etc.. The fact is, most people ca n't do that on a sustained basis, or the incidence of heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, etc. in this country would be way down. For myself, I aspire to taking perfect care of myself, but I refuse to beat myself up anymore for not being perfect! My pump allows me to cheat occasionally without losing glucose control, and I try not to overdo it on the ``cheating ''. That 'll have to do for now until I somehow become the perfect person (oh yeah, I WISH!)######As another type 1 reporting in, there is alot of misinformation going around, I have Dr Bernstein's book and whole heartedly agree with his advice but some of the ideas here about eliminating carbs are are not only dangerous but impossible. Think of glucose as fuel. Your body and brain need that fuel to operate. So you, meaning anyone, have to keep constant levels of glucose in your body. To a diabetic, low fuel can lead to brain damage, coma, or even death. So any diet needs to be brought before a Dr or a Dietician before starting. Any person can produce ketones when they allow their body to go into a mode where the demands of the body outweigh the amount of glucose in the body. Ketones are simply fat burning. NO diabetic should go on a ketosis diet without being closely monitored. I will NOT go on the Atkins diet simply because there is too great a risk of being in ketosis and being happy that I am losing weight when in reallity, I am in ketoacidosis and I am burning muscle. That is why it should be watched closely. It is impossible to eliminate carbs from the diet. A simple peice of whit bread has 15 grams in them. Also, you have to get real about a diabetics day. We work long and hard to build a life outside of diabetes. No one would be a slave to their diet to the point where carbs were eliminated. I dont know if the comment about your friend having too little time was your perception of thing or if that is how he really feels but I can say that I have little empathy for that idea. I am a type 1 SAHM of 4. 3 of those kids are not even 4 years old. I didnt get diabetes when I was a kid. I got it when I was 21 years old and full of bad habits. Diabetes is an issue of control. Either you control it or it controls you! Either your friend will realize that learning about this disease is not a matter of choice or he will go around uneducated and in poor control. Either way, while it is very nice of you, learning about this is something that will be his cross to carry.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Thanks######If your brother has Type 1 diabetes, the only treatment is to use insulin, either with syringes (shots) or through an insulin pump. There currently is no permanent cure except a pancreas transplant, and they usually do n't do those unless the kidneys are also failing. If your brother has Type 2 diabetes, then it would be treated initially with diet, exercise and possibly oral medication. If he 's overweight and loses most of the excess weight, he then might not need any medication at all. But if he IS Type 2, it 's important that he not delay in treating it, as the blood sugar must be stabilized as soon as possible while he is attempting to lose the excess weight. I 'm assuming that it 's more likely that he 's a Type 1. A regimen of a shot of long-acting insulin taken once a day, coupled with rapid-acting insulin taken before eating and geared to the amount of carbs he will be eating, is the best way to control Type 1.

Cells use the hormone insulin, made in the pancreas, to help them process blood glucose into energy. If the above process takes place successfully, then there is no problem at all, but when muscles, liver, and fat do not use insulin properly. or, the pancreas can not make enough insulin for the bodyâ$ s needs. As a result, the amount of glucose in the blood increases while the cells are starved of energy. The normal range of blood glucose are: Fasting: 70-110 mg/dL After 2 hours of taking food: 110-150 mg/dL When the results exceeds the above maximum limits, you should take care of diabetes. There are three types of diabetes: 1. Type 1 Diabetes:- Type 1 diabetes are called insulin-dependent diabetes. In this form of diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the bodyâ$ s immune system has attacked and destroyed them. Taking insulin, regular exercise, controlling cholesterol and blood pressure are the treatments. 2. Type 2 Diabetes:- It is the most common form of diabetes. People can develop type 2 diabetes at any age. It is a condition in which fat, muscle, and liver cells do not use insulin properly, or the pancreas not produces enough insulin. Treatment includes taking diabetes medicines, making wise food choices, exercising regularly, controlling blood pressure and cholesterol. 3. Gestational Diabetes:- Some women develop gestational diabetes late in pregnancy. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. Gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin. PRE DIABETES Pre diabetes is a serious condition that can be described as the stage comes prior to type 2 diabetes, i.e blood glucose is higher than normal but lower than the diabetes range. Fasting: Normal â$ ``70-110 mg/dL Pre Diabetes â$ ``110-126 mg/dL Established Diabetes- > 126 mg/dL After 2 hours of taking food: Normal- 110-150 mg/dL Pre Diabetes â$ ``150-200 mg/dL Established Diabetes- > 200 mg/dL Having pre-diabetes also means you are at risk for getting type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However, you can reduce the risk of getting diabetes and even return to normal blood glucose levels with modest weight loss through healthy eating and moderate physical activity. If you are told you have pre-diabetes, have your blood glucose checked again in 1 to 2 years. The people at risk for type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay developing type 2 diabetes by losing a little weight. The results of many researches showed that weight loss through moderate diet changes and physical activity, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels can delay and prevent type 2 diabetes. Pre Diabetes Diet: When you are in a Pre Diabetes condition you need to have lots and lots of vegetables and fruits which are rich in fibers and are nutritious. Vegetables: Carrots, Spinach, Lettuce, Onion, Cucumber, Mushrooms, Cabbage, Cauliflower Tomatoes, Green and fresh beans, Broccoli, Beets, Lettuce, Okra Fruits: Apple, Oranges, Grapefruit, Lime, Peaches, Strawberries, Blueberries, Dried Apricots, Purines, Pears Sea Food and Meat in Pre Diabetic Diet You can have sea food and meat when you are suffering from pre diabetic conditions but you need to restrict the daily intake to a weekly basis and have to choose the options from the below given list. â$ cents Sea food may include fishes such as sardines, tilapia, tuna, haddock, cod, halibut, catfish herring, etc.. It can also include shellfish. â$ cents Poultry product may have egg, chicken, turkey, duck, etc. but all without skin. â$ cents Other meat may have beef, pork and lamb but they should be fat free. Grains and Legumes: Concentrate more on whole grains than on processed grains. Following list may help you with pre diabetic conditions. Oats, Bran, Brown Rice, Buckwheat, Cracked Wheat, Bulgur Wheat, Millet, Barley, Wild Rice, Popcorn, Amaranth, Quinoa, Rye, Flaxseed, Spelt, Wheat Berries By taking the precautions as listed above you can delay or prevent getting type 2 diabetesâ$ ¦######When at pre-diabetes stage, one should do a clinical test to see which organ is the predominant source of problem, the liver or the muscle/fat. Corresponding medications then can be used to specifically treat the problem organ. For example, if your problm is mainly the muscle, you may not need take any medicines or change diet but just do physical exercises to boost muscle insulin sensitivity. In theory at least, this should help you correct the problem better and stop the process of becoming type 2 diabetes. By the way, in your article you are talking World Health Organization values of normal glucose. By the ADA standards, the fasting glucose is up to 100 mg/dl and the 2 hour glucose is up to 140 mg/dl.######This post has been removed because it did not meet our Community Guidelines..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

I guess my A1c test was high. Does this mean that I have diabetes? Thanks! She said my thyroid test was also high, are they connected in any way?######No, the diabetes is the liver connection. Thyroid is located elsewhere and not related. Best to get with the doctor and get information from the tests and what it all actually means. Good luck.######This is a copy and paste from journal.diabetes.org:######Hi there, Rainbowdawn, At a basic level, they are connected in that are both endocrine disorders, with diabetes being the most common. A high A1C probably means you 've encroached into the world of diabetes on some level but the key is understanding where you are at. Diabetes treatments run the gammut from making better lifestyle choices to having to supply your body with insulin. Try not to be nervous as 97% fall into the lifestyle category. Taking many things into account, your doctor is the best person to explain the best course of action to get you back on track. Elevated thyroid levels could signal something going on and, like diabetes, types & treatments run the gammut with many being extremely common. But again, your doctor is the best person to put things into perspective. I 've been hypothyroid for 20 years and diagnosed Type1 diabetic this Jan05. and I 'm 37 y/o. I 'm not sure exactly how they are connected scientifically (other than metabolically/cellularly) but my Endocrinologist is the one who determines my medication levels for both thyroid meds and insulin levels. Until I went Type1 (requiring the need of a specialist), I was always treated by my family doctor who followed practiced guidelines. Some background on thyroid & diabetes: Diabetes is correctly divided into two major subgroups: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. This division is based upon whether the blood sugar problem is caused by insulin deficiency (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2). Insulin deficiency means there is not enough insulin being made by the pancreas due to a malfunction of their insulin producing cells. Insulin resistance occurs when there is plenty of insulin made by the pancreas (it is functioning normally and making plenty of insulin) but the cells of the body are resistant to it 's action which results in the blood sugar being too high. The sole function of the thyroid is to make thyroid hormone. This hormone has an effect on nearly all tissues of the body where it increases cellular activity. The function of the thyroid therefore is to regulate the body's metabolism. So, take heart in that, while you may be having to look at some lifestyle changes, all will be well. Hope this helps some. Cheers,- Vikingirl######What a nice, encouraging and down to earth reply, Vikingirl! More of this type of posting is needed, I do believe; too much doom and gloom and trying to scare people of their minds going on around here. I hope ``all will be well '' for everyone here, I just liked your particular phrasing. Cheers to you, too.... Roxanne.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes
838	63	5c62324ac061d6b8ea5add2d	http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic104.html	1	Diabetes Q&A.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes######What Is Diabetes? Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes.######What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes.

The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets.

I do n't know what the symptoms of carpal tunnel are and was getting nervous, because I just started school to become a transcriptionist. It 's a relief that this does n't sound like any of your symptoms! Thanks again!######Found this that might help ``Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or itching numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers. Some carpal tunnel sufferers say their fingers feel useless and swollen, even though little or no swelling is apparent. The symptoms often first appear in one or both hands during the night, since many people sleep with flexed wrists. A person with carpal tunnel syndrome may wake up feeling the need to ``shake out '' the hand or wrist. As symptoms worsen, people might feel tingling during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. In chronic and/or untreated cases, the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. Some people are unable to tell between hot and cold by touch. ''######Thank you for passing that along! I have a couple of the symptoms (feels stiff and swollen, but do n't appear that way). I 'm assuming I 'd have to have more symptoms than that for it to be carpal tunnel.

Carpal tunnel syndrome describes a condition generally known as a peripheral entrapment neuropathy. Specifically, the neurological pathology is caused because the median nerve (the peripheral nerve which goes from the hand to the arm) gets squeezed (â$ entrappedâ$) at the wrist. Among other things, the median nerve controls sensory information sensations from the palm side of the thumb and fingers (not the little finger). The nerve passes through the carpal tunnel. This is a canal formed between wrist bones and the ligaments that hold them together. The canal forms a passageway for the median nerve, the tendons of the flexor muscles of the hand. The entrapment occurs because sometimes the tendons and other tissues thicken. This narrows the carpal tunnel causing the median nerve to be compressed. The result of this squeezing is manifested differently in different people. It may result in pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, and sometimes these sensations radiate up the arm. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME? It is extremely rare for the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome to begin quickly. Instead, the symptoms generally start gradually. The person feels sensations like tingling, burning or itching numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers. It is especially pronounced in the thumb, index and middle fingers. Often, the fingers feel swollen, even though they are not. These sensations can occur in one or both hands simultaneously. It is most common for the symptoms to first appear at night. Many people report waking up and having to wring or â$ shake outâ$ their hands. If symptoms worsen, the sensations last into the day, generally with tingling. As the condition progress further, the person might feel a decrease in grip strength. It becomes difficult to make a fist or grasp small objects. In severe and chronic cases that re untreated, there is wasting of the muscles at the base of the thumb and people lose sensation of hot and cold. You can do 3 simple tests which are consistent with a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (but, for course, are not necessarily definitive tests). If you answer yes to any of these tests, then you may have carpal tunnel syndrome. 1. Phalen Maneuver Flex your wrist gently and as far as possible (i.e., bring your fingers as close to your wrist as you can). Then hold this position for 1 minute. Do your symptoms- especially numbness- appear or get worse? 2. Tinel Test With your hand straight, lightly tap the skin over the crease in your wrist. Does it result in a tingling or â$ pins-and-needlesâ$ in the hand? 3. Durkan Test With your hand straight, apply firm pressure to the wrist crease for 30 seconds. Relax for one minute, and then apply firm pressure to the palm (just past the wrist crease) for 30 seconds. Do either of these make your symptoms (especially numbness) appear or get worse? HOW IS CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME TREATED? Carpal tunnel syndrome is not something you just get rid of with drugs, shots, or surgery. You merely suppress the symptoms because the underlying cause is both anatomical and physiological. We do n't know why it rears its head when it does, although some believe repetitive strain brings it on, but more research is needed to be sure. The traditional treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome attempt to relieve pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. However, no single treatment choice is right for every person. The factors to consider for treatment depend on 1) How severe the symptoms are and what 's causing them, 2) How long the symptoms have been felt, and 3) How much the symptoms affect the personâ$ s life (at work and home). Once diagnosed, treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome should begin as early as possible, under a doctor's direction. The underlying causes (such as diabetes or arthritis) should be treated first. An initial treatment generally involves resting the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks. This means avoiding activities that may worsen symptoms, and immobilizing the wrist in a splint or brace to avoid further damage from twisting or bending. Cold packs are used if there is inflammation in order to help reduce swelling. Carpal tunnel syndrome treatments fall into two general categories: surgical and nonsurgical. Both have potential risks and benefits. NON-SURGICAL TREATMENTS Most people with carpal tunnel syndrome should at give nonsurgical treatments a try. These treatments work best below the age of 50 and if the symptoms are mild to moderate, not constant and began less than 10 months prior to evaluation. The great advantage of nonsurgical techniques for carpal tunnels syndrome it that they are less invasive than surgery and most people obtain at least short-term relief from one or a combination of nonsurgical treatments. The great disadvantage of nonsurgical techniques for carpal tunnels syndrome is that they usually are effective only in cases of mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. They may not provide permanent symptomatic relief especially for advanced cases. Also, nonsurgical treatments may lead a person to postpone an operation that is inevitable. If too much time elapses before deciding on surgery, it may reduce the chance of a completely successful operation. Activity modification For most people, the position of the wrist position is vital to controlling the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. The more the wrist is bent, the more pressure is put on the median nerve. Therefore, precautions to take in order to protect oneâ$ s hands include: Reduce wrist bending. Avoid bending the wrist all the way up or down. Relaxing grip. Avoid gripping too hard when driving, writing or using hand tools. Most people use more force than necessary when doing hand tasks. Choose tools wisely. When writing, use a thick pen with an oversized, soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink. Modify hand tools such as going from a straight handle to a pistol grip. Avoid vibrating tools. Take breaks. When performing activities that require repetitive, forceful motion with wrists bent, stop every 15 to 20 minutes and gently stretch and bend the hands and fingers. Use proper posture. Poor posture causes the shoulders to roll forward, shortening the neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in the neck. Keep hands warm. Pain and stiffness are more likely to occur if hands are cold. Splints Splints (braces) are the most commonly used non-drug treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome. These immobilize the wrist in a neutral position and most people use them during sleep. They are generally effective to varying degrees Active medical devices The Carpal Therapist is a relatively new device and is unique in that it is an electrically powered massaging device. It combines the immobility features of the brace with active therapeutic massaging as from a physical therapist. Electrical motors in the brace massage the tendons of the wrist, stretching the tendons and reducing swelling in the carpal tunnel. The Carpal Solution is a device very much related to a brace in its concept and to some extent, its function. This reportedly causes stretching and re-shaping of the wristâ$ s anatomy using a three pronged tape system. WristTrac is another device targeted for carpal tunnel syndrome. This device is a brace with a built in stretching mechanism and reportedly results in stretching of the forearm tendons in a manner similar to traction. Physical therapy When the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are mild to moderate, physical therapy or special hand exercises can be used for relief. There are certain exercises that can be used which include gliding exercises to help relieve carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms, and when used in combination with other treatments, such as splinting, they appear to be more beneficial. Ultrasound and contrast baths are said to provide short term relief, but may not be very effective in more severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. Drugs The most common treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is symptomatic relief using drugs. Drugs can ease the associated pain and swelling, particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen. Diuretic pills (``water pills '') can decrease swelling and may offer pain relief. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) or the lidocaine can be injected directly into the wrist or taken by mouth (in the case of prednisone) to relieve pressure on the median nerve and provide immediate, temporary relief to those with mild or intermittent symptoms. This is also true of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplements. However, persons with diabetes and those who may be predisposed to diabetes should note that prolonged use of corticosteroids can make it difficult to regulate insulin levels. Exercise In situations where symptoms are not too severe, stretching and strengthening exercises can be beneficial. These exercises should be supervised by a doctor or physical therapist. Additionally, an occupational therapist may be sought because they are trained in evaluating people with physical impairments and helping them build skills to improve their health and well-being. SURGICAL TREATMENTS One of the most common surgical procedures in the United States is carpal tunnel release. This is generally recommended if carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms last for 6 months. The surgery involves severing the band of tissue around the wrist to reduce pressure on the median nerve. The following are types of carpal tunnel release surgery: Open release surgery, is the traditional procedure used to correct carpal tunnel syndrome. This consists of making an incision up to 2 inches in the wrist and then cutting the carpal ligament to enlarge the carpal tunnel. Endoscopic surgery is far less traumatic and allows for faster functional recovery and less postoperative discomfort than traditional open release surgery. Either two or one (double portal or single portal carpal tunnel surgery, respectively) tiny incisions are made in the wrist and palm. A camera and surgical instruments are inserted in the incisions in order to cut the carpal ligament. Full recovery from carpal tunnel surgery can take days to months, although symptoms may be relieved immediately afterward. Additional results in some patients may be infection, nerve damage, stiffness, and pain at the scar. Occasionally the wrist loses strength because the carpal ligament is cut. Recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome following treatment is not uncommon. However, the majority of patients recover completely..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

When I returned for the first follow up visit, I had numbness and tingling in the palm of my hand. The doctor said that this was normal and would take about 6 weeks to go away. The PA in his office said that I should have physical therapy, but the doctor said no. I went again in March and again in April, with the same problem and the same discussion took place. Still no PT. Finally in May the doctor oked PT, but the physical therapist said that I should have come when I had the stitches removed. I told her the doctor refused the referral for three months. After two months of Pt and no improvement, the doctor said that it could take anywhere from 6-12 months to get back to normal. I am now over two years after the fact and still having problems and trouble using my hand. New doctor said not to rerelease it as it could make things even worse. Other hand needs surgery but new doc wants to wait until last possible minute in case same things happens. I am sooo ready to cut my hands off because the pain gets so bad.

This is what I was told. If you put pressure on your elbow it cuts off the nerve and makes your pinky and ring finger go to sleep. So that 's an easy fix. Just do n't put your elbows on the desk. As for the numbness in your palm, that could be the beginning of something. Keep an eye on it and see if it continues. For me, the beginning of cts was pain on the back of my hand that went from my pointer finger down to my wrist. But then, we are all different and you may have other first symptoms.

A study by the University of Pennsylvania looked at the effectiveness of yoga for 42 people with carpal tunnel syndrome. People in the yoga group did 11 yoga postures twice weekly for 8 weeks and had a significant improvement in grip strength and pain reduction compared to people in the control group, who wore wrist splints. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is an injury caused by a pinched nerve in the wrist. The injury causes pain and numbness in the index and middle fingers and weakness of the thumb. Carpal tunnel receives its name from the eight bones in the wrist, called carpals, which form a ``tunnel '' through which the nerve leading to the hand extends. Signs and Symptoms: Signs and symptoms of CTS include: Ã cents ï ¿ 1/2 Â cents Nighttime painful tingling in one or both hands, frequently causing sleep disturbance Ã cents ï ¿ 1/2 Â cents Feeling of uselessness in the fingers Ã cents ï ¿ 1/2 Â cents A sense that fingers are swollen even though little or no swelling is apparent Ã cents ï ¿ 1/2 Â cents Daytime tingling in the hands, followed by a decreased ability to squeeze things Ã cents ï ¿ 1/2 Â cents Loss of strength in the muscle at the base of the thumb, near the palm Ã cents ï ¿ 1/2 Â cents Pain shooting from the hand up the arm as far as the shoulder What Causes It? : The carpal tunnel is filled with tendons (bundles of collagen fibers that attach muscle to bone) that control finger movement. Tasks requiring highly repetitive and forceful movements of the wrist can cause swelling around the tendons, resulting in a pinched nerve and producing CTS. Who 's Most At Risk? People working with small hand tools in manufacturing and those using a computer keyboard on a regular basis are especially at risk. Did you know that Women are 2- 5 times more likely than men to develop CTS. It most commonly occurs in people ages 30 -60. CTS is associated with health conditions, such as Lyme disease, hypothyroidism, rubella, pregnancy, obesity, and menopause. High caffeine, tobacco, or alcohol intake is contributing risk factors.######I do yoga and I am about to have cts surgery done privately in the UK. What yoga positions were they doing? It has been painful to do downward dog for a long time and there are other positions I wo n't attempt. Is there a source or a reference for this study anywhere online or can other yoga teachers advise... btw: I had the open procedure done 4 years ago and it was 4 weeks off work and now thinking of doing the keyhole procedure. MANOS isnt available in the UK or I would try it.

The right hand started doing this about a week or so after the left hand had the surgery over 5 weeks ago. The left hand has not healed yet and about the time the incision in the wrist bled and turned red, I have been having some kind of fever/chill episodes and got ahold of the doc on Saturday and tried to explain the situation and he thinks I 'm fine but reluctantly called in an antibiotic. After 2 days on the antibiotic, the fever/chill episodes have GONE! The redness in the wrist is not as bad, but still kind of painful and the left hand now cramps when trying to grip anything! I think I will go crazy- although I 'm already that way!######Ann55, It is a type of focal dystonia in the hand. The muscles of the thumb which are innervated by the median nerve, originate off the fascia in the palm. So, sometimes, grasping or opposition type movements will cause the muscles to cramp. You should try to determine exactly what type of activities seem to bring it on the most. Is it writing (fine movements), strong grasping, or prolonged (static) grasping. Then try to modify the movements that bring it on. If it is static grasping, take frequent breaks. Schedule the breaks, so you do not wait till the hand in cramping before resting. If it is strong grasping, use instruments or tools that provide you with better biomechanical advantages, so you do n't have to work so hard. In other words, use pliers with longer, padded handles or use instruments to turn tight nuts off bolts, instead of using your fingers, and so forth. If it is the fine movements like writing, check you writing instruments and how you are holding them. Many people try to strangle their pencil when they write. If your knuckles blanch when writing, you are strangling your pencil. These patients need to relax their grip. Use large caliber writing instruments (like you used in kindergarten). You can get foam or silicone tubes to go on the pen or pencil, making it larger and padded. Also, try to not use just the fingers for the majority of the writing. For taking notes or a lot of writing where it really does n't matter what it looks like, use the whole upper extremity when writing. Save the use of just the fingers for very fine work, where what it looks like matters. When writing like this, take frequent breaks. Hope your hand heals well and your symptoms resolve. Remember, it takes time for the soft tissues to heal, then they have to be rehabilitated, and that takes some time. The underlying tissues are still healing when the skin incision has healed. You may be trying to do too much, too fast. Mother nature tends to work only at her own rate. Good luck.######This post is being reviewed to be sure that it adheres to our Community Guidelines. Thanks for your patience!######Wow. You are the only one who has any idea of what is going on. Well, it first made its appearance after driving the car with the right hand and that was at least an hour or so after driving. I was waiting at the doc with my daughter who had an unresolved sore throat- I really do n't recall doing anything with the right hand at that time (the right hand has also carpal tunnel syndrome but not done yet) when I noticed pain shoot down from the wrist and then the cramping. I just about cried as I thought I had experienced every pain, burning, numbness, shock like pains that this condition could produce (as well as it going up the arm). I was able to get the med. assistant to get me some ibuprofen and called my hand doc and they had never heard of anything like this, even the one today who called to remind me of my next appt. She had CTS and this was new to her. Yes it is any kind of gripping motion that seems to set it off with both hands- including the one that has had the surgery done. I 'm typing with one finger stretched out to avoid any kind of ``grip '' I drove my daughter to a friend's house (5 mins. away) and on the way there it started to cramp, so I stuck both arms through the steering wheel to maneuver and told her she had better find a way home. Thanks so much for replying. I can fold my towels with my left a little until the cramp starts and that 's the end of the laundry for the day.######Ann55, Unfortunately, I 've seen too many of these cases over the years. It is not something that is taught in the usual hand training programs. Usually, only modification of the instruments or biomechanics seems to help. Remember, with static grasping (like when driving), change your hand positions frequently and try not to grasp the steering wheel too tightly. When you are doing activities like folding the towels, plan breaks in the routine, before the pain sets in. As you know, once the pain starts, it 's usually the end of that activity for a while. So, every fourth towel, for example, stop and stretch out your palms, wrists, fingers, and rotate the shoulders and neck for about 15 to 20 seconds. The start up again. The actual cause of this focal dystonia is still really not known. It is speculated that it may be due to local ischemia of the tissues. Is it the muscle contractions that cause the ischemia or is it the alternation in the muscle action due to the changed innervation from the CTS? No one has been able to prove anything yet. So, it 's treat the symptoms the best you can. Good luck.######Thanks so much. I just got through looking at this ``condition '' and decided to check the site again- except I have n't checked my email which would have told me that you replied. I noticed a lot of posts are saying things like neurotransmitters in the brain, and talking about basal ganglia etc.. Well if neurotransmitters are part of the problem I have to tell you that I have been on antidepressants etc for 30 years due to a huge emotional shock I encountered after the birth of my 3rd child, so I could easily go along with the neurology theory of the brain. I see my doc on Monday and I guess we will see what he says although as far as I know he does n't know much about this and he is a hand surgeon, so neurology is probably not in his field! I had to drive today (taking the back streets again) and when it started to cramp, I immediately let go and pushed my arms through the steering wheel with the hands out straight and fingers flared out, so I will continue to not use them in any type of grip as much as possible. This is going to be a huge challenge for a person used to using hands for so much!######I went to see the doctor 2 days ago and he has put me on Arthrotec (some kind of anti-inflammatory). I am back to typing one finger again. I tried typing with both hands for a few seconds last night but that hurt too much. The scars and a large area of my palm turn purple now. He actually listened for awhile but would cut in if he thought I was taking too long to say anything. I just told him of the hand cramping and details of when it happened etc.. As I was leaving his office I happened to ask if he knew what focal dystonia was to which he replied ``let's not go there! '' and that is about all. I still feel very frustrated and I am going to go to another doctor for a second opinion. My hand that had the surgery was the ``severe '' category and now my right hand is hurting to the elbow and it was only ``moderate '' in July! I hardly do anything and I just want to cry!######I have now solved the mystery of the cramping in the hands. It is still associated with the carpal tunnel syndrome and does not seem to be one of the symptoms that most people associate with carpal tunnel. I was able to get ahold of something called The Carpal Solution- basically some kind of stretchy thing that goes on the back of your hand- got it for my right hand because I did not like the idea of having this same surgery with the kind of results I got, and the cramping disappeared literally overnight. Oh it has 3 tape pieces that pull on the palm of the hand. I noticed that within 2 days the cramping disappearing from the untreated hand but the one that had the surgery (which by now I could not even put a glove on or any kind of gripping motion in any way including the fingers bending) had pain going up the arm again- this was the final straw that sent me to surgery on the left hand. So I got ahold of this carpal solution for the left hand and you know now I have absolutely no cramping in the left hand either. I believe the pain that I thought was post-operative was actually still the carpal tunnel syndrome because with this little ``bandaid sort of remedy '' it is great now, and I can type all I want with both hands and no ill effect. I am able to go back to my favorite hobbies including wiring and carpentry and I feel fine!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

I am not sure what allergy shots you were getting or why they were stopped. Chronic sinusitis is often allergic and can be due to mold infection too. A damp wall in the house, carpets, and ACs are all potential sources of mold. Please consult an allergy specialist. You may need to take the allergy test. Chronic sinusitis can also be due to EBV infection. The other possibility is deviated nasal septum (this was corrected in your case). Nasal polyps and tumors, worms in stool causing high eosinophil counts, gastric reflux are the other causes. The treatment will be complete only on removing the cause. Hence please consult an ENT specialist (you must already be under one) and discuss these possibilities. Depending on the cause treatment will be prescribed. Hope this helps. Take care!######Ime told i have alergies to mold,, i will contact my dr asap and try it again. Whene i was a kid i had allergies to dogs-cats-dust-drass-oak trees- you name it.

If it is chronic you probably have a systemic candida infection and need to stop with the antibiotics and start with treating the systemic infection. I have had this for many years and finally think i have found the key to treating this thing created by my doctor way back in 1987.######I wo n't get into a detailed argument with the first responder to your post but would encourage you to be extremely wary of that non-scientific advice. The polyps may be the root cause of the infection not clearing. They can block the natural drainage passageways in your sinuses and cause infections to recur almost immediately. Has your doctor recommended anything to help shrink the polyps? Generally a short course of oral steroids followed by the use of a nasal steroid spray and Singulair are pretty effective at keeping polyps from recurring (unfortunately, there is no natural way to deal with polyps, they are difficult to treat and, if not addressed, can require surgery to remove them. Here 's a list: 1. Get a Neil Med Sinus Rinse bottle and irrigate your nasal passages 2-3 times a day. 2. Talk to your doctor about a steroid nasal spray to keep the inflammation at bay during allergy season. 3. Take an antihistamine daily during allergy season (and consider undergoing allergy testing). You really should look for an ENT or allergist who specializes in treating chronic sinusitis so you have someone who can help you manage this (if the ENT recommends surgery right away get a second opinion).######Scientific? I post nothing that is not verified medical fact.######When I lived in Colorado I had the worst sinus infection ever, caused by the dry air and dust. It was Colorado Springs in 1992. I do much better in a moist climate, but that 's just me. At least in Colorado there are good NDs to treat you.######I simply hope that people will take the time to actually verify those ``facts '' before they start thinking that antibiotics contribute to sinusitis. Bacterial sinus infections that are not properly treated with antibiotics can cause serious health problems.######I was given antibiotics and seldane only for my sinuse problems to return a short time later. I now have and have had chronic sinusitis for many years as a result of that witch doctor treatment and have now realized the source of the chronic sinusitis as well as the fact seldane was removed from the market as a dangerous drug. That 's what modern so called scientific medicine has done for me. I suspect you are in medicine and think you guys need to be ashamed of yourselves for what you do to people.######Your suspicions could n't be any more wrong. I have battled chronic sinusitis for 20 years but have had the good fortune to have been treated by 3 incredible doctors (2 ENTs and an allergist) who have helped me get my sinus issues under control. I wasted thousands of dollars on bogus natural treatments before I finally found a doctor who actually specialized in treating chronic sinusitis and I am incredible grateful to him (Dr. Donald Leopold at the University of Nebraska Medical Center) for helping treat and educate me about chronic sinusitis. I do n't want others who suffer from chronic sinusitis to spend the time and money chasing phony hope when there are real, scientifically proven, treatments out there. I certainly understand how people become frustrated because chronic sinusitis is a difficult disease to diagnose and treat, but blaming it on Seldane or antibiotics might just keep someone from getting the help they need to find lasting relief..######-Otolaryngology###-Sinus Problems

It 's me Rajesh from Nepal. and I do have a sinus problem, and hope to get solution to get it rid from my health sooner.######Hi, and thanks for your query on eHealth forum! To get rid of sinusitis, you have to find the cause. Chronic sinusitis is often allergic and can be due to mold infection too. A damp wall in the house, carpets, and ACs are all potential sources of mold. Please consult an allergy specialist. You may need to take the allergy test. Chronic sinusitis can also be due to EBV infection. The other possibility is deviated nasal septum. Nasal polyps and tumors, worms in stool causing high eosinophil counts, gastric reflux are the other causes. The treatment will be complete only on removing the cause. Hence please consult an ENT specialist (you must already be under one) and discuss these possibilities. Depending on the cause treatment will be prescribed. Hope this helps.

My problems started back when I was about 12? or so. That is when I had my first sinus infection. Since than I get terrible colds a few times a year and have problems breathing. Over the last year or so my suffering has increased, about 11 months ago I began to get a terrible sore throat on one side. Went to a doctor and she told me it was n't strep (got tested) and just a normal sore throat and to get rest. Anyway the sore throat lasted about 2 weeks and was almost unbearable. Than in June I started to get terrible headaches, and felt more stuffy than normal and another doctor told me I had chronic sinusitis, and that I had a sinus infection and told me to use a neti rinse and gave me 2 weeks worth of antibiotics. Than in August the sore throat came back on the same one side, terrible headaches on and off than the sore throat went away. Now starting a few days ago the sore throat has come back on the one side, along with terrible heads and a bit of ear pain all on the one side. Does anyone think this is another sinus infection? I feel like I 'm in and out of doctors constantly the past year. I went back to the doctor last month and was told I had a cold, but this time it feels different. Please tell me there 's something out there that will help me more and I hope this is just another infection. Thank you so much for your time######>> Hi you say you have a diviated septum which could be the cause of your problem! I understand they could fix the septum through surgery! What did your Dr say! Have you asked him before about the posibillity?######Hi, I also have a deviated septum and am often blocked up on one side or the other. I have had only one bad Sinus infection and was recomended (Sudafed) by an ENT specialist. He prescribed it in tabs form but some months later I found it in liquid form. I must say of all the things I have tried I found this to be the best. It goes without saying that if you have an infection you will require Antibiotics but for normal use this is good.

Hi everybody, I 've been reading this thread and your stories resonate with me a lot! I 'm 27 years old, and my battle with sinusitis started about three years ago. First I started noticing some clear post nasal drip and allergy/sneezing type of symptoms that would come and go. I did n't pay much attention to this, since it was not debilitating. About a year later, I caught a bad cold that turned into a sinus infection. When the cold subsided, the infection also subsided from the right side of my nose, but the left developed chronic sinusitis. I suffer from pain over the eyebrow, fatigue, eye pain and twitching, a lot of yellow mucus and yellow post nasal drip. I went on maybe 6-7 different antibiotics to no avail. MRI scan showed inflamed and opacified maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinuses, on the left side, normal on the right. ENT wanted to do surgery, but I postponed it and tried a dozen different herbal remedies and irrigating with goldenseal, echinacea, eucalyptus oil, red thyme extract, lavender oil, the works! Despite all that, the sinusitis is now spreading on the right side and CT scan showed opacification of my right ethmoid as well. Sucks! I 'm finally caving and probably having the surgery next month. However, I 'm still pretty sceptical since it seems to me that it does n't help the majority of people- plus I 'm scared of acquiring irreversible damage. I want to ask you the following: has anybody tried oral antifungals like Diflucan or Nizoral for their sinusitis condition? I 've researched online and there are a few scientific publications where docs tried longterm antifuncal treatment on chronic sinusitis patients when all else failed (antibiotics, steroids, surgery) and found that the patients responded. And then, there are alternative healer (naturopaths) who swear that chronic inflammation of the sinuses is just another symptom of systemic fungal infection (see the book by Rob Ivker- Sinus Survival). I tried getting my GP or ENT to prescribe an antifungal just to see if it works, but they would not hear of it! It is not common medical practice and they feel they have n't exhausted all the other options with me. However, even though these drugs have significant side effects I think it 's worth a shot if they 're actually treating THE CAUSE of the infection. Antibiotics have side effects too, that I suffer through without seeing any sinus improvement! So that 's why I wanted to ask you guys: HAS ANYBODY TRIED DIFLUCAN or NIZORAL for their chronic sinusitis? Thanks a bunch to all the brave sinus warriors out there!######Hello ellie27, I 'm not a DOCTOR. Have you tried any Natural Antifungal Remedies? Look into ``Xlear '' (looks like XClear) it 's a nose wash with GSE (Grapefruit Seed Extract). From what i 've read, GSE is a Natural Antifungal, but do n't take my word for it, do some research yourself. It did n't cure my ``Constant Throat Clearing '' problem, but it might work for you. Also look into Wild Oil Of Oregano. Hope you find the cure soon. Pls keep us posted. Take care..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Sinusitis

She gardened and used her stationary bike and treadmill regularly. Then about 4 yrs ago her doctor put her on Baycol (a statin drug) for her elevated cholesterol. Almost immediately she began having severe muscle aches. She reported this to the Dr. and he responded by switching her to a different statin medication. This process was repeated over the course of about 2 yrs. She was put on Lipitor, Zocor and one other statin. Each time when she went off of the statin the aches improved, but never went away totally. As soon as she began taking another statin the pain increased to the point where she was almost incapacitated. Now it 's been about a year since she has been on any statin and she still suffers. She and I have both been reading about fibromyalgia and agree that she has many of the symptoms, fatigue, lethargy, muscle aches and weakness, restless legs, etc.. We are wondering if her use of the statin drugs, which are known to cause muscle wasting, could have triggered fibromyalgia in her. Can anyone provide any insight or personal experience on this?############It is funny you posted this because I have never been the same since I took Baycol. I am off all statin drugs, and I still hurt everyday. One doc tells me I have Fibro and another says I do n't.######Hiya, I have been taking statins for almost 2 years, but have n't noticed an increase in my symptoms of fibro. Sorry I ca n't be of more help. goldenwings######You are the first to express a similar response. Thank you. My mom and I are frustrated because everyone we talk to or read about says that, yes, they did have muscles aches while on the meds but they disappeared a short time after discontinuing the drug. I feel so sorry for my mom. Her mother, who is 83, enjoys much better mobility and general well-being than my mom who is 63.######I had what seemed to be bouts of Fibro symptoms prior to taking Baycol, but they were far and few between. I even took Zocor and Lipitor before. I ca n't recall if they gave me muscle aches or not. That was in 1998. But after six months or so on Baybol,,, these symptoms are everday and have not gone away. They pulled baycal off the market over two years ago. As a matter of fact, the first week of Baycol I was terrible. The doctor cut the dose in half to lessen the symtoms. My high cholestrol was caused by my liver overproducing it. Not by my diet. I have bascally stopped eating meat, eggs milk and cheese. Wiyh almost a chostrol free diet, my was still high at 252. I lowered to 188 by using the natural methods such as Plant Sternols, (Cholestoff) Flax Seed Oil ETC.. I thought the lab made a mistake. But a second test 6 months later showed I was at 208. Still better than I was on statins. Of by the way, my count was 226 with statins.######I never had any muscle pain till I was put on a statin 7 yrs. ago. After going off of the statin, my muscle pain improved but never went away. I was then diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I have read on other message boards about people who claim they have ``statin induced fibromyalgia '' but doubt you will ever find a doctor to admit it.######If you can remember where it was that you saw this, I 'd be interested in reading anything on this ``syndrome ''.######google search for ``DIT Message Board '' then click on the drug lipitor######Fibromyalgia is a syndrome that is made up of clinical symptoms based on certain set pressure points. It is a disease of pain perception. Statins can cause muscle inflammation. There is no inflammation in fibromyalgia. In other words, there is no such thing as statin induced fibromyalgia... HOWEVER, the pain that you are feeling might be due to an effect the statin had on your muscles. Have you had any bloodwork done?.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

My newest Rhumetologist talked me into taking it regularly, so I do. Taking it with IB Profren makes it work better. Doing this helped me get through the summer We had allot going on & I really feel it helped sooo much! Unfortunetly tramadol just takes the edge off, wish it did more. Takes two hrs for it to do anything. Always works best by the 2nd dose. Unfortunety, it 's still not enough. I 'm looking at going on a more natural med... Taking a muscle relaxer between doses also helps! Course, I am still like you where I do my best to not take meds much... You said you have to work tomorrow. Taking tramadol in the am & again 4 hrs later will help you get through the day. You have to learn to tackle it before it gets worst.

I live in Delaware but was raised in Queens and my husband is from West Hempstead. Just had to throw that out there. . lol. I am finding that most docs besides pain management specialists and rheumys are about the only ones that understand and treat fibro. I was sent to a cardiologist since I have very high cholesterol and diabetes. . both a result of bad genes and not my diet. As I filled out the form for the cardiologist and he reviewed it he just looked at me and said. . boy you have alot of things going on and taking so many meds for a woman of your age. When I said it was mostly fibro. . I got that sideways look like ``yeah right '' that does n't exist. My cousin's wife has what they think is fibro and has been to different rheumys who all wanted to treat her differently and one even said there is no such thing as fibro. I 'm sorry this sounds so negative but I hope more people chime in with some help for you. I just wanted to put my 2 cents in about most docs. My rheumy doesnt do anything more than prescribe muscle relaxers either. He does endorse yoga and moderate exercise and when I do some light stretching I do feel much better.

My muscular pain started after I began taking Zocor. I 've been trying to make the connection for 2 years.######Zocor like many statins can cause muscle pain/damage/temporary or permanent. It would be hard to determine which pain is Zocor related and fibromyalgia, if you already had fibro before starting the Zocor. Be sure and get the enzyme test that determines whether you have muscle damage from Zocor. My husband's test was normal but he had muscle problems that caused his knee to twist and ended up with knee surgery. Try changing your diet and limiting ``saturated fat '' to not more than 7 grams per day, preferably less. This should reduce the LDL in many people. Less starches and sweets will lower tryglicrides. Exercise such as walking helps reduce the bad cholesterol and increase the HDL. If you have read that dark chocolate is good for cholesterol lowering, think twice, because many dark chocolate things contain high amount of saturated fat.

I have n't been sleeping too well at the moment. No specific pain just body aches/coldness/numbness. I was going through a phase just before Christmas of nipping back to bed about midday for an hour and then finding it difficult to get out of it! My last total wipe out was about 3 weeks ago when I helped hubby lift some rolls of loft insulation- took a couple of hours then the Mother-in-Law was popping round as it was my son's birthday and guess what- I really felt exhausted and grumpy because all I wanted to do was go to bed !!!! I had to pretend to be happy to see her and granddad, I felt I had to make something nice in kitchen but I could bearly keep my eyes open. It passes after 2-3 hours gradually and I think it 's just catch up exhaustion. All I can suggest is try not to fight it, I always try but it 's useless. Just try to relax cause that really helps. If you feel really exhausted and have chance- go to sleep, it 's what your body is shouting for. My dogs have the right approach- they sleep on-and-off most of the day until walkies Take care, Clare x######ahhhh i 'm sorry sometimes i ca n't sleep then bam, I feel like i can sleep forever.

Over the next four years, I developed a list of various symptoms as follows: First year: Intermittent pains all over body- chest, head, limbs, ribs (I remember them being fairly sharp and usually only lasting a few seconds to a few minutes) Intermittent tingling, numbness, burning sensations (mainly finger tips, toes, hands, feet at first, would come and go throughout the day only lasting for short times usually) Dizziness/light headedness (I think one or two episodes) Occasional nausea Irritable bowel Year two: same symptoms as previous year plus... Lots of muscle twitching all over body Headache with light sensitivity Frequent sinus congestion/infection Year three: same as previous years plus... Left calf muscle becomes weak for a few weeks and then goes away (had trouble just pushing in my clutch) Later same year left calf muscle goes weak again and then right follows, both go away after a month or two Occasional Restless legs in late evening, I felt compelled to move them every minute or two, usually hour to two before bedtime and sometimes after going to bed Occasional blurry vision and eye drainage Year four: same as previous years plus... Left calf muscle goes weak again, following by right, followed by all major muscles in my body, feels like my muscles are straining to do anything, but I can still lift heavy weight... I do n't appear to be losing any muscle mass, this lasted for a few months Trouble concentrating/thinking and remembering things, forget where I m going/how to get there Word swapping and letter reversing, I always have to check my emails now to make sure that I have n't skipped a word or replaced a word with a different word of similar spelling but completely different meaning Quick tempered and not much patience with things (past 9 months or so). I have had a few periods of sudden rage in response to minor issues Some head pressure (feels like balloon in my head), ear popping past three months added: Developed what I think is arthritis in my knees, then fingers, hands, elbows and shoulders (in that order), the aching/pain is n't there all the time, it comes and goes A few instances of heel pain and what I think is tendon or ligament pain, pain is also about six inches up the back of my leg from the heel I have seen neuro, gastro, cardio, endo, and a rheumatologist. I have had brain mri (4), head CT (2), x-rays, spinal tap (MS, Lupus), EKGs, nerve conductivity test (2), EMG (2), colonoscopy, abdominal CTs and ultrasounds, lots of blood tests (lupus, thyroid, and other autoimmune diseases). All my tests have been normal except: high cholesterol (runs in family... 270). I did recently have a western blot and blood PCR through quest labs and they both came back negative (I grew up in a wooded area and it was common for my parents to find ticks on me) I just saw the rheumatologist yesterday and she said that she thinks I have fibromyalgia, but admits that I do n't have any trigger points. I 'm not sure that I believe her, but I do n't have much choice at this point. She gave me a prescription for elavil (sp?) and told me to exercise every day if possible... come back in 2 months for follow up. SORRY THIS IS SO LONG... If anyone has an feedback, I would greatly appreciate it. Does anyone think this could be still be lyme? Are there other tests I should have done?######Forget to mention, I also was dx with trace mitral valve prolapse... then again, who has n't...######MToms, Lyme can cause many of the symptoms you describe, and many people who have Lyme were first dignosed with Fibromyalgia. It is very important to see a Lyme knowledgeable doctor to confirm or rule out Lyme. No test is completely reliable, and a knowledgeable doctor will consider your entire history..######-Infectious Diseases Board###-Lyme Disease

Searching the internet I find a few decent websites with recipes for those with hypertension but one problem I have is that I 'm not going to immediately change from chicken wings, pizza and fast food to tofu and vegetables overnight. I 'm looking for recipes which are better than the diet I have been living with, which is nothing short of horrible. I 'd like to find a spaghetti recipes which is healthier.

If anyone can point me toward recipes which may help me make the transition I 'm attempting, I 'd appreciate it. Right now I have a few goals I 'm working on: 1. One fish-centered meal per week. 2. One vegetarian meal per week. 3. Large sides of vegetables with every meal. 4. 30 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. This is just my initial goal.

Severe reactions & damage are happening to many people. Many of them unaware that their solution is causing similar but a new host of problems. I am suffering with gastritus and have had the worst year of my life physically since taking prilosec. Many years ago I had reflux from a high stress job and coffee, etc.. After a parent died, and a severe reflux bout, I did n't understand reflux. No one explained eating lots of small meals. . or laying down on an incline, or sitting up three hours after you eat. . or cutting out wine, chocolate, sauce, spices coffee. . though I figured some of that out. Instead I too Nexium for SIX Months... fearing to get off it. . but I couldnt stop the nerves I had and my mother realized it WAS the medicine. So I stopped and slowly got back to normal. . that was in my 30s. Flash forward... some reflux again in my 40s... I find out I have POLYPS in my gallbladder. . WHY? welll reading on reactions it says some users get stomach polyps too! . Not good. But not realizing I took Prilsec again for two months. Older and more vulnerable to reactions, I went by ambulence for TWICE for the first time in my life after taking prilosec. I also had a knot under my stomach that got worse and worse. . all the while thinking it safe and not strong enough for reflux going wild. . NOT REFLUX THOUGH. . it was Gastritus! far worse. . ruining my digestive system. Soon I was unable to drive... !! totally a basket case physically and mentally. Then I could n't sleep... SLEEP APNIA !! digestion impossible at night a NIGHTMARE. Weeks off the prilosec and I could walk outside take a shower more confidently but the rumbling in my stomach made my sides hurt for MANY months and I felt like I had to hold the walls when walking down stairs... !! insane I know I was an athlete and this really ruined my year. Friends drove me around for months. . and then slowly helped me drive again. . with them in the car. My arm and fingers were getting numb after eating. Spice would make me feel like I could pass out! But it was just pressure. I still can not get up in the morning and not need to eat quickly or I will face horrible gastritus making me feel like I could pass out. Heart is good. . every test... moniter, you name it... Endoscopy all good no hpylori, no woman cancers... all checked... even a head scan. . all ok but now I am radiated! oh well thanks for the additional risk factor. It was prilosec and the generic equivalent being dished out by doctors who think they need to give you something for you to want to go there. The FDA has been aware of the over the counter and prescription PPI's (omeprazole and other similar names) and they are not properly warning people. REAL DAMAGE is being done to countless people Please google prilosec ruined my life. . where a college kid was totally messed up by it. Also google prilosec reactions etc.. Pills like this can suddenly turn and cause damage that you wouldnt even realized. . they are not innocuous !! they are hurting the people of this country and nothing is being done about it.######Sorry you have had such a bad reaction to PPIs, Tkcli. Have you seen a GI doctor about all this? It may be you have some other underlying condition. The fact is PPIs are saving lives. Yes, as with all medication there are side effects but get the right PPI (there are about 8 different ones to choose from) and the right dosage and if your problem is excess acid (as for the majority of people with GERD) they will solve the problem and prevent the progression to Barrett's Esophagus and possible Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. I know a number of esophageal cancer survivors- and, unfortunately, some esophageal cancer widows, who would give anything to turn the clock back and have taken PPIs before it was too late..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Acid Reflux

My doctor prescribed omeprazole 40mg generic capsules that is covered by my insurance. It is made by Mylan and is delayed release. He wanted me to try it as a last resort before he calls my insurance company to fight for coverage of Nexium. Unfortunately, this omeprazole is not working well. I did n't notice anything until today (3rd day) and now I 'm having significant heartburn and reflux. I had tried 40mg Prilosec tablets (took 2 pills) before the doctor prescribed this omeprazole and I 'll have to say I think it worked better. I called the pharmacy to inquire and they said the omeprazole has no salts which apparently helps absorption in some? I 'm still not sure about this. If this is the case, why have two kinds? So I 'm thinking to switch to Prilosec tomorrow as I 'm becoming more and more miserable by the minute! Has anyone had different experiences between the two? Is omeprazole magnesium the formula closest to Nexium? Thanks for any help! This whole thing with no insurance coverage for Nexium has really been a bummer for me. Just shows how dependent I am on this medication. Thanks so much. Lori######I do n't know much about the comparison, but I do think you need to give the omeprazole more time. It took me 1-3 weeks to feel better and feel the effects of the medication. Once I quit cold turkey (horrible idea) and it took me 2 weeks back on the medication to feel the heartburn being suppressed. Then the omeprazole started to not work as well (I was on 1 20mg dosage per day), so my doctor told me to increase to 2 20mg pills per day. It took about a 1 and a half for me to feel the effects of that. So, give the omeprazole time.######If the OTC version of Prilosec works, then take that. Everyone's body processes things a little bit differently. That 's why it 's sometimes good to have slightly different medicines to treat the same thing. And, yes, the dependency thing is awful! Do n't you wish they 'd warned us?######I have taken what seems likes every PPI ever make like a merry go round use for able like a few years there it seem to lose some of it potencie anyways I have not found anything that works quite as well as Nexium I do not currently use because of the same issue of no insurance coverage. But you can buy omeprazole with magnesium over the conter in tablet and capsule form I currently use prescription omeprazole once day with prescription Radadine at night as needed. My GI doc says not everyone's body is diff so you have to see what works for you you might also ask about Dexilant which is the latest PPI's it was given to me by my regular doctor as a sample but I have not had a need to take it thank god! This stuff is supposed to be great but as like with anything it may or may not be covered by your insurance. GERD LUCK! Haha right this is what my GI do like to say geezs######Thank you everyone. I 've taken the prescription omeprazole from last Sunday to Tuesday. I then switched from that to Prilosec OTC. I thought it was working better but today I 've had my worst day. I 'm on day 5 now of no Nexium and I 'm concerned that this will get really bad in about 2 days. I know for a fact that Prevacid, Protonix, Dexilant do not work for me. Aciphex works very well but my tinnitus increases so loud that I struggle to sleep. I wish I could take it because my insurance covers it. I do not know if this Prilosec is going to work at all but I 'm praying with all my might that it just needs to build up. I do n't know whether to count the generic and the otc formula to say it is in my system now 5 days? I do n't understand why most of these drugs do not work well for me! The docs do not tell you about the dependence and I wish they did. I tried taking lower doses of PPI's in the past and none of them worked for my reflux/heartburn. I have a small hiatal hernia that should not cause me too much grief but it does! My doctor is not ready to call my insurance company and fight for Nexium coverage. I never thought I 'd be in this poistion where I feel like a drug addict!######I got here by typing ``omeprazole is killing me '' into my browser. I was taking Nexium but I recently changed insurance companies through work and they claim that Nexium is not a preventative medication so it is not covered. I took one Nexium a day and it was all I needed to halt my acid reflux, and I had no side effects that I was aware of. I have pretty much tried everything and nothing else works like Nexium. Sorry if this sounds like a commercial, but I do n't care. I got some samples but recently ran out and began taking Omeprazole. It is tearing me up. I have chronic pain and churning. I really do n't know what to do at this point. I could buy nexium for$ 200 a month, but that 's really not affordable. There are some who claim that Nexium is no different that Prilosec, but they do n't know what they are talking about. I would like to challenge the Insurance Company's claim that Nexium is indeed preventative. Does anyone have experience with that?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD
882	48	5ca2f461c061d65f32c3a4fd	http://www.healthboards.com/boards/acid-reflux-gerd/697821-interesting-article-regarding-nexium-vs-prilosec.html	1	Interesting Article regarding Nexium vs Prilosec.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD######Some Key Points I found interesting (somewhat paraphrasing): \* Astra-Merck expected to find few unhappy Prilosec users, but surveys showed only half of those who used the drug were entirely pain-free and satisfied. -- \* Nexium is one-half of the Prilosec molecule-- an isomer of it. Sometimes the drug that results has fewer side effects or is more effective. Often it works just the same. -- \* Astra found that this half-of-Prilosec molecule seemed to get into the bloodstream more efficiently than the whole Prilosec. While executives doubted it would work any better against heartburn, they thought it might be better against something called erosive esophagitis, where burped-up stomach acid injures the esophagus. -- \* Two studies showed there were no improvements between the larger dose of 40 mg Nexium vs the smaller dose of 20mg Prilosec until finally a two more studies showed Nexium eked out a slight advantage after 8 weeks, 90% healing rate vs 87%. -- \* two studies states the Prilosec and Nexium are equal in effectiveness for erosive esophagitis. \* Astra's lawyers persuaded patent clerks in Europe and the U.S. that its scientists had made a novel discovery when they came up with this triple-layering. A British judge later invalidated this patent because of ``obviousness. '' But in the U.S., the trial on the patent's validity has been grinding on since December in New York. Every day the trial continues, AstraZeneca collects another$ 10 million in Prilosec sales, on average. Equally important, it gains more precious time to switch Prilosec users over to Nexium. -- \* Kaiser Permanente, the largest managed-care group, is nonetheless discouraging its physicians from prescribing Nexium. The reason, says David Campen, a Kaiser physician and pharmacy executive: ``Nexium clearly is no value-added drug.######There are a number of studies which show that all the PPI's have basically the same rate of effectiveness. Some individual patients may find that one drug works better or has fewer side effects than another, but there 's absolutely no evidence that one PPI is best overall. My generic omeprazole is nice and cheap these days!######Amen. I 'm using the CVS brand, and it works well...######Do you guys believe the article? I 'm not saying whether I do or do n't, but if this is the case, why have I read so many posts here in these boards that say that neither Prilosec or the generic Omeprazole worked for them. Instead, they finally found some relief by using Nexium. Can it be that all these posters have mentally accepted that Nexium is better, and thus their beliefs are manifesting themselves? I took 1 Walgreen's brand Omeprazole pill for about a month, and it really did n't cure my problems. Currently I am taking nothing. I am a step-away from beginning a Nexium regimen. If I take Nexium for 3 months, and do n't find relief, would you think it more benificial to meet things half-way? Instead of taking 1 Prilosec during the morning, or 1 Nexium during the morning; I would just take 2 Prilosec during the day. 1 in the morning and 1 before dinner. Anyway, I guess I 'm just theorizing but what are your thoughts on all this?######Trymester: I found that one prilosec a day did n't do it for me, but two did. And like I said before, the drugs are very similar, but not identical. Individual patients may have a better response to one drug than to another.######I 've been on all PPI's over the course of my battle with reflux. Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid, Nexium, Aciphex, Zegrid, and Kapidex. My time on each of these was a minumum of one month and up to 4 years. I agree that it is a very individual thing in response to any of the PPI's. I did n't find a lot of difference between most of them. Some worked a bit better than others. Things were under control for a while with some, but none have totally controlled things. I think part of the hype on effectiveness is that so many of the meds are so very expensive. You mentally expect something expensive to work better. Personally, for about 4 years, I 've been on the twice per day regimine. I have one PPI that helps a bit more than the others so that is what I go with. My doctor finally got to the point that he just asked me which one I wanted a prescription for because most just stopped working. As for Nexium, my GI doc really talked it up. Prior to starting on it, I had a bad chronic cough. That was my reflux symptom. Immediately after starting the Nexium, things got bad. I had major heartburn (which I had never had before), horrible nausea and chronic diarrhea. Per my GI docs instructions, I stayed on the Nexium for a bit to see if it would work, but it only made things worse. When I went off of Nexium, the nausea and heartburn went away. As for the diarrhea, that did n't get better. It was frustrating because I did n't have this problem pre-Nexium. It has been exactly one year since I took and and I have officially been diagnosed with IBS. Now, in addition to the reflux issues, I have been dealing with other digestive issues too. Just made my quality of life much worse. My GI doc still does n't acknowledge the role Nexium played in this for me. I later found out from a doc at my local clinic that my GI doc has a contract for supporting Nexium.######I 've been to two ENTS at two different hospitals and a GI at yet a third hospital. All three independently said that Nexium is the best for treating LPR/ acid problems. I tried prilosec first but it did nothing for me. I have to admit the Nexium helped a lot, and I was lucky in that it has n't given me any side effects. I 've now been on it 1.5 years. I think medications work differently in people so you just have to go through the trial and error until you, hopefully, find one that works for you. Kassie######I find that each person's body reacts differently to each drug, I know that I tried every OTC and every prescription for several years before I finally found that Nex worked the best after a month and that was taking 2 a day. This last week even taking 2 a day I am still getting a slight burn in the throat and chest, it 's like it is not working as well now. It was a fun ride being free of reflux nearly 99% of the time in the last year but it did n't last. IF the pharma companies found a silver bullet cure for GERD they would be out of big money that is why there will never be a drug that can cure it or keep it away forever, too much money to be lost for them.######Unfortunately GERD and LPR are the result of a specific physical problem- an incompetent esophageal sphincter- which is unlikely to be cured with medication (and would require major surgery to address). One of the challenges with PPIs is that they are primarily designed to give your body a chance to heal from the acid that refluxes into the esophagus. Many people start to feel better on the medications and do n't take the long-term steps that can help address GERD and LPR (avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller meals, not eating for 3 hours before bedtime, raising the head of their bed) so their symptoms break through the protection of the PPIs. Unfortunately, lifestyle changes plus PPIs are the only way manage LPR and GERD.######Yes, I agree with you all, everyone seems to react or be helped differently by these meds. Protonix did not work for me, and I just started Nexium. I was just diagnosed with a hiatal hernia, which is what 's causing the gerd. I 'm a swimmer, and my doc has advised me to take an antacid just before swimming. Her plan for me is to have me take a Nexium a day to see if I can get some relief, and then to taper down. Of course, I am also doing all the other recommended things, i.e., smaller meals, not eating before bedtime, raising head of bed, etc.. I noticed the package insert for the Nexium mentioned that long-term usage can promote vitamin B-12 deficiency, which is probably why she wants to taper me down. I wonder if you follow all the things you 're supposed to do, if you can eventually be totally off of medication ??######and even if you follow a strict diet such as I and sleep inclined you still will have some episodes from time to time. I 'm a strict vegetarian now for about 6 months and it has helped 90% but I do have a sugar problem and if I over do it will set it off! But I did find removing meat made a big difference in the severity and duration of bouts. The kicker here is you start to feel half way human again and think, ``just this one time wo n't hurt to have it '' but it does. I heard that once you have GERD it 's a disease that never goes away completely and with the surgery people report it comes back eventually but not as severe!.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

I take one 40mg a day. I started taking it on Nov. 17, 2005 and I have had chest pain every day starting Nov. 21, 2005. I thought Nexium was supposed to help heal the esophagus, not cause chest discomfort. (By the way, I NEVER had heartburn before my endoscopy that showed my errosive esophagus.) I go see my gastro on Feb. 28, so I will ask him then. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. (I just had an echo because of my chest pain, so I do n't know my results yet. An EKG is Dec. was ok)######Yes, terrible chest pain and upset tummy during the one month I was on Nexium. I switched over to Protonix (tablet form) and the chest pain subsided. This week I 'm trying out generic omeprazole because it 's 1/9 the cost of Protonix. The weird side effects that I had with Nexium came back immediately. Since Nexium is almost the same as Prilosec (omeprazole), I figured it must be an incompatibility issue with this particular medication. Before chucking the bottle of omeprazole though, I tried taking it without the capsules and so far the side effects have disappeared! So it may not be the medication itself that is the problem but the ingredients that make up the capsule.######Since I do n't go to my gastro until Feb. 28 and my hemo for my test results until March 2, I am going to try something. Today is my second day that I have n't taken my Nexium. I 'm going to see if my chest discomfort might be a side effect of Nexium. There 's no real risk in doing this, is there?######I think it depends on your condition. For the same testing reason that you have, I went nine days without Protonix and my digestive system felt better, but my LPR symptoms went off the chart. I had to restart the medication because my throat pain was unbearable.######tdonline, what are LPR symptoms? Thanks!######LPR is in a nutshell is when you reflux into your throat. My initial symptoms were a sore throat, post nasal drip and bad breath/taste. The vocal chords are very sensitive, so I had a sore throat 24/7 for over 3 months. I only had heartburn while on antibiotics. The chest pains started with Nexium and I still have some discomfort there every now and then. So I think I have heartburn too now. I 'm seeing my GI next week and we 'll probably discuss testing options. I 'm on 80mg of PPI daily and there has been marginal improvement. It 's a frustrating situation because for ingesting so much medication, I expected better returns... ie, return to normal life, disappearance of the bad breath, etc.. The constant sore throat is no longer around, but I do get episodes of burning daily and even when there is an absence of pain, the throat never quite feels right.######I have LPR and here 's what I have been experiencing... > Trouble swallowing > ``Lump in throat '' feeling when swallowing > Hacking cough (not so much now) > Excess mucus in throat (again, not so much as before) > Periodic trouble breathing (asthma type symptoms) > NO heartburn > Redness around vocal cords (as viewed by my ENT) LPR is different than GERD, as you usually do n't get the bad heartburn with LPR as you do with GERD. That ``Lump in the throat '' with troubled swallowing & dry cough are classic symptoms of LPR. You may or may not have a sore throat with LPR.######Nexium seems to cause me abdominal discomfort, but other than that, has helped my reflux. I am taking digestive enzymes, too, to try to assist. Lori######I had been on Nexium for 6 months and asked my doctor to switch me back to Prevacid. I had been on Prevacid before, but after seeing a GI specialist he put me on Nexium. I did n't feel the Nexium was helping. In fact I felt it was causing a lot of side effects. Did a little research and found that Nexium can cause a lot of side effects. Like myself it 's possible that you experience side effects with Nexium. Try asking your doctor to switch you to another med. You should be able to get a list of side effects associated with Nexium if you google ``Nexium side effects. ''.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

My insurance is dropping nexium..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD######Over the years I 've tried many different pills for my acid reflux and the nexium has been working awesome for 3 years now. Granted I take 2 40mg pills daily, but they work. Today I got a letter in the mail from united health care stating that starting sept. 1st, they will no longer cover nexium due to over the counter pills available. Now I 'm worried I wo n't find something that works as well. Any thoughts?######i was sent the same kind of letter for protonix from my insurance there is a way around this mine was toi have the doctor write a letter and send it into the insurance stating this this is the only med you can take otc do n't work as effective as script meds######Did your United Health Care Plan use Medco as the mail-away pharmacy? Are all United Health Care Plans the same- can we all expect to get this letter? It took me 6 months to get approved for Nexium 2x a day when I switched insurance a year ago due to all of Medco and United's screw-ups. Now they want to drop Nexium? Are they planning on dropping all prescription PPIs? I know that every time I get my order in the mail, it comes with a letter asking ``Did I know that Prilosec OTC is now available cheaply? ''######i would imagine that alot of people can expect this kind of letter my insurance was champva i sent my scripts into the goverment i was a disabled vets wife and they did it so i would imagine the private insurance company's are gon na follow######I just called up United Healthcare and they confirmed they are dropping Nexium as of 9/1/2006. They do not have the replacement drug list available yet. This decision can be appealled by the individual. You or your doctor can write the appeal letter, which needs to contain:- Patient Name- Patient Subscriber#- Name of Medicine and Strength- Patient mailing address- Telephone Number- Doctor's Name and Telephone Number. The letter should be mailed to: United Healthcare Appeals P.O. Box 659773 San Antonio, TX 78265 Do n't forget to send it certified! (Not required, but I 'd recommend it)######I took Nexium for about 7 weeks or so and became concerned that taking it much longer could cause more problems. I 'm off Nexium now for about 12 days and I 've only had to take a total of about 6-8 Tums! Nexium may have fixed... something. Do n't get me wrong, I 'm still watching my diet... and I still have some of the throat clearing during the day. I 'm trying the probiotics that a friend suggested-maybe that 's helping. I figure, even if the GERD returns down the road-I 've given my system a rest from the drugs that basically shut down what the stomach needs to properly digest food. I think that 's important to do WHEN POSSIBLE.######Prilosec (omeprazole) and Nexium (esomeprazole) were both originally developed, patented, marketed and sold by AstraZeneca. So, It is probably the closest related PPI on the market-- NOW. When Prilosec came off patent in 2001, AstraZeneca patented the other purple pill Nexium-- was widely promoted, advertised and sold. This was done to make money in the$ 8.9 billion PPI market. There is not alot of dfference between the 2 drugs-- according to Stanford's drug watch person-- Robert Stafford, MD, PHD. But, Nexium does not have to be compared to another PPI only to a placebo for it to get FDA approval. I think what I have read Nexium is 6 to 8% stronger than Prilosec. Harry######you know if i have seen an add from AstraZeneca that if you ca n't afford your meds there is a number you can call and they will base it on your income at little to no cost######I have been on nexium for a couple of years now. I am also on probiotics for constipation but someone stated that probiotics may help your reflux. My refulx is unrepairable so nexium wo n't help but it will help the acid backing up. I wonder if I should try and get off it and try the prelosic again along with the probiotics and see what happens. Prelosic helped but I was getting flutters between my throat and chest. I had a stress test so it was n't that. Anyone had flutters? I too recevied a letter from United Health Care but our company just switched to Aetna on 8/1. I wonder if I am going to get a letter from them now. Thank God I sent for another prescrip before we switched. I have at least a 4 months supply left. Deb in CT######Hello, I am having the same problem. My insurace (Healthnet) is not letting me go for Nexium. Nexium was very effective for me in the past. Now, based on the suggestion of the Doc I am using Prolisec 20MG (OTC) but it is not at all effective. We pay so much money for the insurance and this is not fair that they do not let us get what is needed and what works for us. Is there any way that we can convince the insurance companies to let us get Nexium. Also, is there any other medications that are closer and as effective as Nexium as posted in the question of this topic. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks######Prilosec and Zegred both have the same active ingredient as Nexium- Omperazole. Also, both are availible in 40mg pills/packets.######You probably need 2 of the 20mg Prilosecs to get the same dose you were getting on Nexium.######You probably were not take 20 mgm dose of Nexium-- probably 40 mgm-- So, you may need the same dose of Prilosec ?? I hope this works for you ~ ~ ~ Harry######I 've been reading almost every post on this board for over a year and I have yet to hear of any poster state that Prilosec OTC worked for him/her. This is the Acid Reflux board, for god's sake. If it worked, we would be crowing about it. Prilosec OTC is not an adequate substitute, even for prescription prilosec. Something is going on with the production of the OTC stuff. Theoretically, 2 Prilosec OTC capsules should be the equivalent of one Nexium- but it just does n't work that way in practice. I have LPR- and I got even sicker when I briefly switched from Nexium to Prilosec OTC. I developed new symptoms on OTC that I never even had before starting Nexium (before diagnosis). I was on the OTC for 2 months and ran screaming back to Nexium.######Good point. Everyone I know that has tried prilosec OTC has hated it.######prevacid works good i 've used both.Pepcid ac in a pinch.Baking soda and water in a worse pinch######I just started OTC and actually I feel worst than without taking any PPI. I was on Nexium and it suddenly stopped working or so I thought. Increased belching, chest pains, PVCs. Stopped taking Nexium I actually felt better. I guess I was n't meant to take PPIs.######Prilosec OTC relieves my heartburn, but the side effects are so awful that I stopped taking it. Now, Pepcid AC is n't strong enough.######Am I correct that there is a difference between Prilosec and Nexium in that the latter has the added ingredient to aid in the treatment/repair of damage to the esophagus; weheras the former only reduced the amount of acid produced? I also received the letter fro UHC stating the two drugs are ``therapeutically equivalent ''- but, if Nexium also fixes damage to the esophagus I question the equivalence they are referring to. . or perhaps I am a victim of marketing######Rob, Both Nexium and Prilosec are proton pump inhibitors-- reduces stomach acids-- only. Both were patented by the same company-- AstraZeneca a london based company. Prolosec's patent expired in 2001 and Nexium patent started in 2001. It was done to capitalize on the big PPI market. Neither have anything added to heal a damaged espphagus. Nexium just cost more because it is a brand name product and not a generic. For some people Nexium works better and for others Prilosec works better for acid refux. Both have side-effects that affect some people differently ?? Harry######Yes my insurance told me I needed to try a generic or something else. They would n't let me get Protonix, Nexium, etc. anymore but now that time has passed they are letting me have some more. I think they allow you 3 before they cut off your supply again and request doctor authorization that you need it and have tried everything else known to man first. Well I stopped taking the Nexium ages ago because I figured that it would n't be good on my stomach to take it ``long term '' and indeed I was fine if I watched my diet and such for a long time. Last summer I had a flare up and started taking Protonix and they stopped paying for it so my doctor put me on the generic Omperozole 20mg (I always take 40mg of whatever) and lately my flare up got so bad that I have missed work. I tried Protonix and that did n't seem to work well so I went back to Nexium now and I just have that feeling after 3 months when I go to pick up the prescription they will try to charge me full price. Prevacid gave me uncontrollable dirreaha and Prilocec OTC did absoultely NOTHING for me! I think the insurance companies have deals with certain drugs companies too. Surely they are n't concerned with my health of taking it long term since they are allowing me generic (so far) etc.. Although I have more medical bills if they pulll things like this. We pay so much for insurance and then they treat us like this! I do n't like the idea of using it long term but I want the option of using it and having some help pay for it. It still cost me$ 40 for a 30 day supply of 40mg! My brother's insurance he gets about 3 months for$ 60 which is better..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

I 've heard so many bad things about Nexium, but I figure as I wo n't be on it for years, it wo n't really cause all the irreprable (sp.) damage that I see so many people complaining about. My G.I. said on January 21, 2009 that I had Esophagus: Mildly incompetent L.E.S. Stomach: minimum gastritis in the Fundus and Body Impression: Minimal Gastritis and Mild GERD He had also found H.Pylori, but I 've supposedly cured that. I 've been on Omeprazole for about a month. I want that ``I was on Nexium for 2 months and was completely cured '' story. I want to get back to eating Indian and Mexican food without having to worry about the consequences. This GERD issue just came about randomly in October 2008. It may be caused by another problem, but no one seems to want to treat the main problem, they only focus on the GERD.######I 'm on Nexium on & off now. I had taken it approx 3 months daily (even twice a day at some points). I have n't heard the bad things about it or about any irreparable damages. I do know many say it did nothing for them and prefer prilosec. I guess I better start googling to see what you are referring too...######The PPIs are quite safe really. They might, if you take them for a very long time, contribute to B12 deficiency. The# 1 bad side effect of PPIs is the chronic wallet damage, which I find very painful. Oh, yes, they also cause a form of physical dependency. It 's not addiction, you ca n't be addicted to a drug that does n't affect the mind, but if you 've taken them for a period of time and ARE N'T cured, quitting will cause your symptoms to return worse than ever until your body adjusts. (It only took me 2 weeks to become dependent.)######Hello, I 've been on Prilosec for about a month. I am about to switch to Nexium (I figure I 'd give it a try). Should I just start taking it automatically, or ween my way off the Prilosec and then start taking Nexium. Also, I 'd appeciate any words of encouragement from those who claim to be ``CURED '' by Nexium. And by cured I mean that now you can eat whatever you 'd like and not have to worry about ANY meds. Thanks. I 'd appreciate it.######There 's no need to wean yourself off of Prilosec- Nexium is a similar medication but is more effective than Prilosec so you can just make the switch. Unfortunately, if you 're looking for a ``cure '' you 're likely to be disappointed. Acid reflux is the result of an incompetent Lower Esophageal Sphincter. Nexium (and other PPIs) are designed to give your body a chance to heal from the damage done by stomach acid but they do not fix the underlying problem. Lifestyle and dietary changes can minimize the reflux but there really is n't anything that will ``cure '' reflux and allow you to eat whatever you want to without worrying about medication.######Well, the underlying problem would be: Mildly incompetent L.E.S.. It does n't seem that I 've had a Mildly incompetent L.E.S. forever. This has all just happened to me within the last 6 months. How can this have happened so suddenly? How is this underlying cause fixed?######Typically it requires dietary and lifestyle changes- losing weight if you need to, minimizing the foods that are triggers for reflux (alcohol, coffee, chocolate, etc.), eating 2-3 hours before bedtime, raising the head of your bed 4-6 inches. You need to give your body time to heal from the reflux and then minimize the triggers, over time it can be managed but it takes time and effort.######gcs had it right the 1st time- there is no cure. I suddenly- and I mean, suddenly, the incessant burping started 1 day- got ``GERD ''. That was 3 years ago. It has n't gone away. The only thing close to a ``cure '' is the surgery, but even that either fails many times, and/or causes other problems. All we can do is control the symptoms (if possible at all). In the meantime, people just try to make it out that Nexium is bad because they are simply paranoid that every drug is bad for them (often pushed by the ``naturalists '' to make money on their unproven nonsense). 1st, if you have a bad problem- what choice do you have? 2nd, many drugs have next to no real problems, and are taken for decades. My dad is epileptic and has been taking 2 drugs for it for 50 years. Meanwhile, we simply hope for a real cure. Not everything can be cured. Modern medicine is great, but it 's not perfect.######I got GERD/LPR suddenly out of the blue too. I can pinpoint the day and hour when it all started. I have no idea why. I was 42 and had never had a problem with heartburn or any of the other symptoms before. The only med so far that has helped keep the symptoms bearable is Nexium. I 've been taking it for more than a year. You have to weigh the pros and cons. For me, the pros outweigh suffering through the burping, sore throat, etc, and the damage done by acid eroding the esophagus. I have tried the natural route with Braggs ACV, aloe vera, DGL tablets, but none of it really worked for me. Kassie######Hello Kassie, Do you think you will have to take Nexium for the rest of your life? How many times a day do you take it? Do n't you worry about the long term side effects like when you reach your mid-50s?######Yes, I think I may have to stay on PPI meds for the rest of my life. That 's what my ENT told me. My GI doctor wanted me to do another 24 hr Ph test (my first one only showed mild reflux) because I told him without the medicine my symptoms are quite bad. I get the results of the second test at the end of April. I take two 20mg pills per day, once in the morning and once in the evening. I do worry a bit about the long term effects of the Nexium, but I worry a lot more about developing Barretts esophagus and then possibly esophageal cancer. My father got esophageal cancer after years of acid reflux. He was not on any meds. Although this cancer is not very common, it is not a cancer you want to get-- very bad mortality rate. Kassie######As I see it, if my digestive problems (erosive gastritis) were mild and I could manage them with modest lifestyle changes, I would. But before I started taking the PPIs, my health was suffering because I was unable to eat a nutritionally adequate diet. I was all but living on white starch and still in pain. Now, I can eat most foods and feel all right. Taking medicine every day is not the ideal solution, but it beats the alternative.######I too can pinpoint almost exactly when my reflux started in-- I was laying bricks in the backyard and started belching every time I bent over. I was in my early 30's. I tried the diet, exercise, and homeopathic stuff first. Then I started in with once a day PPI's. That worked for several years. Then I went to taking the PPI's twice a day. Eventually, even that stopped things from being under control. I 've been on every PPI on the market. Currently I am on the PPI that helps me the most. At one point, I fully expected to be able to eventually stop taking the medications. Now, I know it is necessary for my health unless something new is discovered that works for me. I too had an extremely poor quality of life due to my reflux. I 'm just now getting things back under ``control ''. I 'm a bit unusual in that my reflux symptom manifests itself in a chronic cough and breathing problems. When I started needing emergency medical care for reflux related breathing problems, I had no choice but to be aggressive in my self care. I eventually got to the point that I had a Nissen Fundoplication surgery. Although it was very effective, I 'm still going to be on twice a day PPI's for life. If that is what it takes for me to be able to breathe well, I 'll do it. I do have regular appointments with my GI doc, Pulmonologist, ENT and PCP though to monitor things..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

My gastroent suggested that in addition to the 40-mg. Nexium I take before breakfast, I take a 20-mg. O-T-C Prilosec before dinner to see if that will help dissipate the remaining esophagus flutters/twitches I still get on the Nexium alone. Does this make any sense to use two different PPIs? Thanks! Maggie C.######Maggie-- I 'm not real educated, (yet) on using PPI's, altho I have been using them for 7 months now for Acid Reflux. But I have read of a few people using 2 different types at once, which I did myself for a few days. It did n't seem to help me any, but I hope someone will come here and give you some good information. Good luck tho, and I hope you get better real soon! DEDA######I take 2 PPI's and an H2 blocker and magnesium, every day. My Dr said take all that. Nothing is doing me any good. I 've had severe chest pain with each and every swallow of food or water since Jan. 1, had a Barrium Swallow and an endoscopy which showed nothing. Next step will be a manometry. I am quite tired of it already! Good luck. Lia######I took Prilosec for 4 days while my PPI (Prevacid) was gearing itself up for action, and I had diarrhea the entire time. Once I finished the Prilosec & was just on the Prevacid, I was fine. Later my doctor said that taking two of them together was a no-no. However, if your doctor suggested it, I say go for it. It might work for you.######nopizza-- But is n't Prilosec a PPI as well?######Believe it or not I am beginning to have some relief taking Prilosec twice per day, Zantac once a day and magnesium 3 times a day. This morning I feel a distinct lessening of the chest pain and less food hanging up in my throat. It is not over by any means but it is less severe. I will continue to take this combo and see if maybe after 4 mos. of chest pain, back pain, shoulder pain, throat pain, jaw and ear pain and pills and some food hanging up in my throat it will get to the bearable stage anyway. Lia######I have tried all the PPIs, and only Protonix worked for me, but it took weeks of paying for other prescrips and taking them for two weeks with no effect. My doc prescribed double the usual adult dose, but that 's all that works, so i do n't think it 's all that uncommon to try two at once because you never know which ones work for you. Good Luck.######Yes, Prilosec is a PPI; that 's why my doctor advised not to take 2 PPI's at the same time. They apparently do work in different ways; i.e. it was n't exactly like taking a double dose of Prevacid, but enough to give me diarrhea. Both doses might work on some people.######Yes, Prilosec is a PPI. I have 2 samples of otc Prilosec that I might try since RX strength Pepcid does n't always help. I had a Nissen in 1998 that failed after 2 months, so I still need meds. All the foods that bothered me before surgery, still bother me now. I 'm so depressed about this. Also, I was trying to take a muscle relaxer for TMJ, but it causes heartburn too. I just ca n't win. Do I want heartburn that can cause narrowing of my esophagus again or worse, or do I want to have relief from muscle pain?######Maggie, When I first got GERD, the Doc at a teaching Hospital said anything more than 20mgm of a drug like Prilosec was a waste. He gave me a reseach paper put out by the Manufacturer that verified this for GERD. I know you do n't have that but you may need More minerals/ electrolyle studied of your system ?? fluttering, spasms and twiching can all be a nutritional problem-- You certainly have been messing around with Medical Doctors long enough to cure or find your problem !! I would start looking for a new DOC or Specialist !!.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

Thanks everyone !!!!!######All the stuff I have read seems to show that Nexium is the best. I have used Prilosec, Zantac, Prevacid, Aciphex and Protonix at various times in the past. I used them to help avoid problems when I take NSAIDs. My wife has had GERD for several years and now takes Nexium with good results. She had stopped responding to Prilosec and Prevacid so Nexium was the next choice. Zantac and Prilosec are OTC now. You should be able to try those and see how you do. All except Zantac are PPI- proton pump inhibitors.######I was max doses of Protonix. Did n't really help. Now I 'm on Nexium twice daily and it work excellent for me.######Is n't Nexium only once a day? How long can people be on the Nexium at one time?######I am to take twice a day. Thats what my doctors have me on. I 've been on it for about 3 months now. They plan to keepme on it for awhile yet.######To be honest if you have severe cases, none of them really work that well.I have been on every popular one and none of them worked for me. Upon the recomendation of others on the bords I strated taking Magnessium oxide and It works wonders for me.######You ca n't tell how severe GERD is by symptoms. Often the symptoms are much worse than what the test results indicate. Everyone reacts differently to PPIS-- it 's an individual thing. One person may have great results on one particular drug-- but that same drug may not help another person at all. It 's trial and error.######Just to add to the disscussion I was on em all but now Aciphix and that seems to work best for me? Any others? HAp######From what i 've heard, there is no best one for everyone, each formulation is a little different and each person responds differently to the meds. I tried them all and protonix was the only one that actually worked for me. \ I would recommend asking your doc for samples before you fill a scrip. I filled a scrip for prilosec, nexium and one other before i got to protonix, that 's three co-pays before i even got the right med!######How much magnesium oxide are you taking? I 'm taking 250mg a day along with Nexium (40mg) and was getting great relief from symptoms. Now, however, the GERD symptoms are coming back. I 'm just curious if you were taking mega doses of the magnesium oxide.######no, not taking any of that.######I 've been on Prevacid, Nexium, Prilosec, and Zantac (not to mention about a million other stomach meds). All these meds, except Zantac, are proton pump inhibitors. My doctor said they are all very similar, but slightly different, and all good. He said whatever works for you is the best. None work for me. Right now I 'm on Prevacid 30 mg twice a day, just because my doctor did n't want me off ppis.######I am on Locec 20mg 1x per day and my symptoms are 90-100 percent gone. Can very a little day to day. Sandra It, s aso a PPI######I 'm on my 3rd week of free sample of nexium and so far no relief and I 've tried all others. I also have Barrett's esophagus with no cell changes thank heavens but at this rate of no healing what next? Surgery is the last option and I 've tried all the pills along with all the otc to go with them. It 's caused small damage to my air ways, lungs, throat and who knows what else after only 6 months of it. I hope Dr gives me more free samples... I do n't want to pay through the nose for something that does n't work.######I have been on Nexium for about a month now. I have a hiatal hernia and the gerd symptoms associated with it. I went to a chiropractor to try to see if he could massage it down as described in another post. This particular person did n't seem to know how to do it and I was wasting alot of$ in just copays. The nexium seems to be working but I 'm worried about the long term use of it. I get some stomach pain but I do n't know if its the Nexium or my diet. Has anyone been on this for a long time without any negative side effects? I just turned 40 and I hate to have to be on this for the rest of my life. Any Suggestions... MDB######my Pharmacist did say that she knew of many people on it long term and that Nexium is one of the safest drugs to take. My only question is, Is n't Nexium fairly new? Is this going to be a turnout like Vioxx was and will Nexium eventually be realled because it took all that time to figure out that Nexium really did more damage than good? That 's what I worry about with new meds.######Iv ' e been on Protonix for 2 years and maybe once had gerd. works great for me 40 mgs. i was in the hospital when i found out i had acid reflux disease. thought i was having a heart attack.######Was on zantac 150 2 x a day for bout 20 yrs, had a second child and for some reason it stopped working.Doc then put me on prevacid 2 x a day worked like a charm.Take care.######From what I understand, nexium is basically the same thing as Prilosec. The drug company's patent expired on Prilosec, so they needed a new cash cow, therefore Nexium was created. No, I am not a conspiracy nut, or anti-drug company. I have heard this from pharmacists and medical professionals.######I 've been on Prilosec's gen. off spring, Omeprazole for almost 2 years now. It works great for me, better then Nexium did anyway. I really did not like the way Nexium made me feel but, it did seem to help just the same. In the past I 've been known to not take it on the weekends and let me tell you, by Monday morning I 'm right back to square one and swear that I 'll never miss a dose again. The only side effect I 've had with it is a missed heart beat, well, really my heart beats and then beats again before it 's time to so I guess it 's a fast beat but anyway, it only does it twice a minute or so and I have had no ill effects from it. The info that came with my prescript for it said that maybe a side effect and that is the only one I have from it. Now, on the other hand, my brother-in-law can not take Prilosec because he is allergic to it. On yet another hand, my dad takes prevacid (spelling?) and that works great for him. As other posts have said, it all depends on the person and what works best for that person and getting free samples is the best thing to do before getting a prescript for something that may not work or may made matters worse. - M######I was diagnosed with Barrett's Esophagus 3 years ago and was told that I had to have an endoscopy done every 2 years to make sure those pre-cancer cells did not turn into the real thing! I was put on Aciphex back then and it 's workeded very well (no heartburn at all unless I eat too much chocolate) then I pop a Tums in my mouth. I had a grandfather who died of esophageal cancer so I want to keep on top of this thing. Long story short- my insurance company has decided that I do n't need the Aciphex anymore. I was told that once you have Barrett's that it has to be treated for the rest of your life. Can an insurance company just say ``no '' to paying for meds someone really needs? I 'm still waiting on their reply but I know that these over-the-counter meds are not nearly as affective as the prescriptions ones. If I do n't take the meds, I get horrible heart burn, I lose my voice (it gets real hoarse) and I sometimes get choked on the reflux. It 's all very scarey and annoying !!!!! Does anyone have any suggestions on what else I may be able to do? Thank you!######I bought a set of 6 '' bed risers and raised the head of my bed. I sleep on a slant but I do n't even notice it. fly######I guess that we 're talking about American brands of certain drugs, because I do n't recognize the names (except Zantac and doctors do n't generally prescibe that hear, it 's OTC.) I 'm in the UK and have found the both Lanzoprazole (Zoton) and Omoprazole work about the same for me. I get about 80% relief from them, but have to self medicate, depending on symtoms and what I intend to eat... For example when I go to the movies I know that a bag of sweets (that 's candy, my USA friends, lol) will give me aweful reflux, so an extra dose of my PPI 90 minutes beforehand will allow this naughty indulgance (I do n't drink alcohol, coffee or Smoke, so give me a break.) However I 'm having a fundo soon as I do n't like that I need such high doses of drugs (3 x 20mg Omoprazole a day) for only 80% relief! Bring on the knife !!!######Does anyone know if the Zantac 300 can be broken in half? My insurance quit paying for the 150 and it helped. The doc gave me 300 and told me to break it in half but not sure if you should.######Hap, My Mom was just put on AciPhex (they believe the Protonix rendered itself ineffective). After 4 days, she feels just as bad. How long for this to take effect? How many mg are you on, twice a day? Thanks! Lori######= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = hi Tex, I have read in many many places, folks break pills in half. If inner contents tend to spill, use mashed slice of bread, like rubber sheet for texture, as a wrapper. But do it without touching it at all, since fingers carry germs.######Losec is Nexium, I believe. It 's omperazole. Prevacid is lansoprazole.######I have tried practically all of the meds: Zantac, Prevacid, Nexium, etc. etc.. Personally the one I have found the best is Ranitidine 150 mg (one tab per day). Zantac 75 is exactly the same as Ranitidine, only 1/2 the strength. Ranitidine puts out the ``fire '' or heartburn better than the PPI's-- my observation. (I found Nexium better than Prevacid/Prilosec, as far the the PPI's were concerned). ALL of them seem to slow down the digestive process, I find, which is a paradox......######Hap, My Mom, who suffers from extreme reflux and hiatal hernia just recently switched to AciPhex, after her Protonix rendered itself ineffective (so says the GI Dr.). After two weeks on AciPhex, 20 mg, twice daily, it has n't done all that much, and Dr. has now suggested going on it THREE times a day. Has anyone been on this type of high dosage before? He also says to take a Pepcid once before bedtime. Thanks! Lori######I took Protonix for a few months and it worked wonders for me. I had 0 heartburn the entire time. I ran out of the sample doctor stuff and now my heartburn has returned so hoping to get back on it.######Nexium worked the best BY FAR for me.######I take Protonix, 1 pill a day and I am still on the samples. It has been ok for me however, I NEED to stick with taking it everyday. I tend to get a little lazy and not take it everyday and wondering why it 's not working, lol.######Zantac is n't a PPI, it 's an H2 blocker. That is why it ``puts out the fire faster. '' Because it 's meant to work quickly. PPIs take up to a week to work, but generally work better.######Ranitidine is Zantac. For me I take 30mg of Prevacid twice a day. I take up to 300 mg of Zantac up to twice a day as needed. I also take reglan as needed. I ca n't afford something like prilosec or nexium, the student pharmacy does n't carry them. I also pepto bismal as needed, and I take fiber. Slowly increasing fiber intake is good for bowel problems and supposed to be good for the digestive tract overall.######Kyethra, how does Reglan work for you? I was on it for about four months, and it was absolute hell. I had a ton of side effects, and never remembered to take it at the right times.######Well I only take it as needed. And it helps me keep stuff done. Rather than get the heartburn on the meds, I get mostly the reflux. On my 24 hour probe the dr. said that my stomach was incredibly acidic (60% more than it should be and that was already on 30mg on prevacid in the morning) and that when I registered the GERD activity it was the bile comming back up. Reglan increases stomache motility so it helps move things out faster. Diarrhea is one of the potential side effects, but I find it actually helps me with that. I also tend to gag on mucus sometimes and then start retching. On a bad day the reglan will help move the stuff out and then there is less to retch up and it breaks the cycle that otherwise seems to occure (the more I retch the more I gag, and then the more I gag the worse it gets and I throw up a little bit half a dozen times, etc). I take 10-20mg at one time.######When I went on it it was after a pH probe that showed a ton of reflux. The pH probe was done on 80 mg of Nexium a day, so something needed to be added. I was put on Reglan, 40 mg a day (maybe why I had more side effects than you), and was not told that it could be used as needed, but that it was something I should be on all the time. I am just starting to get heartburn. Before that it was all vomiting and refluxing. I also have asthma that is a billion times worse when I am refluxing all the time.######thats usually my first sign to look at reflux problems- the asthma. I have heard bad things about being on reglan all the time-- aparently I was on reglan as a baby and had a bad reaction to it. I always approach new meds cautiously and I would not want to be on reglan all the time because of potential side effects such as fatigue and so forth.######I had major fatigue! Oh my gosh, I slept all the time. I also had terrible headaches, and was getting really depressed. My dose was cut in half and then I went off it completely. It 's a relief! It did n't help much anyways because of the weird timing required. Anyways, I typically use Phenergen or Compazine to get me through bad patches, and it does okay. Have you considered going on a higher dose of Prevacid? I 'm on 60mg a day.######I am also on 60 a day. Not familar with phenergen or compazine though. I 'd really like to get a consultation about enteryx, GP thought that was worth pursuing.######After being diagnosed with reflux after a Barium swallow (and a three-month sore thorat) I was prescribed Omeprazole (20mg day) and started sessions with a speech therapist here in the UK to hopefully get my oesophagus working again! Omeprazole stopped my acid immediately- no ore heartburn or nasty tatse in mouth. BUT after 4-5 weeks I began to get groin pain, lower backache and Gynecomastia (tender, slightly enlraged breasts)- all worrying symptoms for a male (can all be testicular cancer related- had doctor check `downstairs' and he was satisfied that nothing was wrong). Reading the insert, all of these symptoms were also listed as side effects from Omeprazole (albeit `rare '). Groin pain went after a couple of weeks and I stopped taking the Omeprazole for a week but the acid came back so went back onto them. Symptoms all receded after about ten days but came back after a week or so. Have now been on 30mg of Lansprazole a day for a week- fingers crossed but all PPIs have similar effects so I 'm not getting my hopes up. Anyway, so although these side effects are listed as rare, they do happen- a friend of my family (female) suffered exactly the same symptoms as me on Omeprazole- how `rare ' is that? I 've posted another listing to find out if anyomne else has suffered the same!######Phenergan and compazine are anti-emetics used to treat nausea. I have them because nausea is a major reflux symptom for me..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

Doesnt seem to get better can you stay on these forever ???######I 've been on Prilosec for years and my doctor says that it 's okay to stay on it for the rest of my life.######Been on ppi's since early 20s am now 51.######Have you had any longer term effects from being on them for so long? Noticed anything? Thank you so much I am concerned about having to take them for life as well...######I would like to know as well. Various sources are either for or against the long-term use. There 's some controversy. I find the information available quite confusing. Supposedly, the long-term effects have not been studied.######Im 51 now, started on meds in my early 20s. Iv been on tagamet, acidphex, pepcid, prilosec, zantac, and now prevacid.I was on tagamet and zantac the longest.Ive had no side effects that i know of.Because my symptoms can be so bad i have to stay on them for life.There were times that i thought i was getting better, and stopped for a day or so.But then i would have so severe an attack i would have to go back on it.Take care.######Thank you so much, Suzy! That 's exactly what my doctor said about stopping the PPI. If you do, it gets worse. Much worse. I guess I should be grateful I have not had this miserable disorder for 49 years... take care######Your very welcome flowergirl.######Good question! I was wondering the same. I have been on Aciphex for 3 months (2nd time on it) havent taken meds for two days (trying to go off it) and have been having chest pains today######k2626, Why are you trying to discontinue the ppis? Has your doctor instructed you to stop taking the Aciphex? I 'd be very careful... at least my doctor warned me about what would happen with the cessation of PPI therapy. (I believe him). Looks like yours did n't. You are a brave soul and I wish you the best of luck! flowergirl######Well my pains got so much better I rarely would get them so I figured it was time to go off, especially since I have been on aciphex for 3 months-aciphex is not supposed to be for long term use. Also, I noticed I gained 5 pds and apparently weight gain is a side effect of PPI's. I know 5 pds is nothing, but I have no idea how much more it would go up. I work out 2.5 hrs a day and eat pretty healthy so I am sure it is not my diet causing this. I am sending my GI doc an email tonight about going off it. What did your doc warn you of? Are we to just depend on PPI's for life? Shouldnt we try going off to see if we are ``healed '' at least? In the meantime I am switching to DGL and continuing drinking aloe vera juice (this has helped a TON) This whole acid thing is just so confusing!######Everyone is different. I am sure there are people here who discontinued the PPIs successfully with few or no problems. I do n't know what the consensus is regarding the stopping of a PPI therapy. I do know that many people take these drugs long-term for obvious reasons. I assume their reflux is too severe without them. I also gained weight while on this and other weigt gain causing drugs. The extra baggage ads up quickly. My meals are also very healthy. Losing weight is not going to be easy. I inquired twice about discontinuing the PPIs. The doctor just said each time that I could not stop taking them because my reflux would get much worse. I do n't want it getting any worse than it already is. flowergirl######Hi! I have been on PPIs for 13 years. I had a gastric ulcer, then several episodes of esophagitis/gastritis. I have stayed on because my symptoms are bad if I try to go off. However, though my pain is nearly gone while taking PPIs, I still can feel the reflux, even into my mouth, & frequently have cough, hoarseness, congestion, etc. related to the reflux. I did quite a lot of research and found that successful discontinuance of PPIs is quite rare. A study in Sweden, I believe, compared tapering to abrupt stopping and found no difference- pretty dismal both ways. I wanted off because my health has become progressively worse, I have become B12 deficient (ca n't be absorbed without stomach acid), and I 've gained weight slowly but steadily over the 13 years. Highly motivated, here's what I did: 1) COMPLETELY eliminated problem foods: Sugar & artificial sweeteners, Milk products, Wheat, Corn, Tomatoes, Citrus, Caffeine, Chocolate, mint, & anything fried. This does leave eggs, poultry, fish, lean meats, seeds, nuts, veggies, whole grains (non-wheat, non-corn), and occasional fruits. I take several nutritional supplements, digestive enzymes, and probiotics (all recommended by my fantastic doctor- we should all be so lucky to have a real, thinking doctor) 2) Once I was beginning to feel pretty good, I did a very fast (3 day) taper then STOPPED the PPI. I got WICKED heartburn but held on, knowing that it was rebound. I used Zantac as needed, tapering that, then just Gaviscon Extra Strength as needed. This took about 3 weeks. Gaviscon is my new favorite weapon for flare ups. 3) To my amazement, within only a week or two I no longer had joint stiffness, swelling of hands and feet, urinary frequency or urgency, headaches (once the caffeine was all gone), abnormal blood sugars, or low energy. Oh, and despite eating as much as I want, I 've lost 8 pounds in the process. I suspect there are long-term effects of PPIs that are poorly understood as yet. They sure seem like a miracle when you start, but they guarantee their own longevity (and long-term profitability). I 'll NEVER take them again. I hope that one day I 'll be able to successfully reintroduce some of the problem foods, but right now, I 'd just rather feel this GREAT!######I just got myself off of Protonix due to major lack of sleep from the nightmares which was the only known side effect. My doctor said that it 's fine to take occassionally if I have to take the pain pill which irritates my stomach but there 's no way I want back on Protonix again. I feel so much better and actually am getting decent sleep.######I 've been on some form of acid meds since 2004! For me I find what I 'm taking stops working after a while then I get on another and so on then back to original. My Gastro Dr had said when my symptoms were gone to stop for a few days or until symptoms were back! I 've never been able to go longer than a week without trouble starting! I 'm sick of the whole mess!######I weaned myself off nexium taking it 1 year. It took me 2 1/2 months going from 40 mg to 35 to 30 etc. using clear capsules purchased at a health food store. I did have some ``rebound '' acid reflux during the process but found Zantac twice a day helped a lot. Finally I only took zantac as needed and now have been nexium free for 2 months with no problems. I maintain a healthy, low carb diet and feel great. No more joint problems, headaches etc.. The nexium DID heal my esophagitis but after one year I felt I could get along with out it. No doubt about it... you will get REBOUND reflux when weaning off... but for me... the result was worth it.######What a great success story, Justice! I am so glad you 've been able to get off your medication. Thank you very much for describing the steps you took to successfully stop your PPI therapy. Knowing that there 's a way to do that gives me hope and something to work towards. I think most doctors are well aware of the fact that once the PPI therapy is started our bodies adjust and it becomes very difficult to generate just the right amount of acid without the aid of our medication. We should have been told about this while there was still a decision to make, instead of having to live with the consequences if we choose to end our PPI therapy. When I wanted to stop taking this medication, my doctor told me I could n't because the reflux would get worse. I resented hearing that for sure!######I recently weaned myself off nexium after taking it for one year.It did heal my esophagitis but I was tired of having joint pain, headaches and little sleep. It took me 2 1/2 months to totally wean myself but was worth it. I bought some clear capsules from a health food store and went from 40 to35 to30 to 25 etc. until I was down to 0 mg. I did have some painful REBOUND reflux during the process but zantac twice a day helped with this. I have no pain... no reflux now but I do watch my diet... not too many carbs... and smallish meals and snacks. I no longer take any zantac, tums, etc.. This process may not work for everyone but it did for me.######Can any of you tell me what kind of diet is best. I do not want to be on this medication for life and right now, it 's not even working that great. Any suggestions? Thanks, Laurie######What an excellent post justice, I printed it. I 'm now concerned that eventually I 'll have even more side effects from NEXIUM beyond the weight gain I 'm currently experiencing. My Gerd is slowly improving and I 'm wondering how many ``GERD FREE '' days I have to have before weaning myself off NEXIUM. By the way, Endoscopy showed no evidence of erosion or any inflammation. I get better information from this forum than my GI, who has no clue about my prognosis or even if the Nexium actually cured any erosion since I took Prevacid/Nexium for a few weeks before the Endoscopy. Can Nexium cure an erosion in just a few weeks, so as to leave no evidence on the endoscopy?######I 'm not sure I 've been GERD free in the last year. I 've been pain free a lot, but of course PPIs only turn off acid production, not reflux. A lot has been written about the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and how foods and other things relax it and allow reflux of gastric contents (caffeine, high fat, smoking, etc.), but the focus is shifting away from the LES to the gastric valve and other possible causes (food sensitivities, infection, altered motility, etc.) Turning off acid production should, and does, protect the lining of the esophagus from the acid when reflux occurs, but does not do anything to stop reflux. It 's like a bandaid- makes it feel better, but does n't address the real problem- why is food going backward in the first place? And what about the purpose of the acid in the first place (to aid in digestion). The potential problems include nutritional deficiencies and changes in the lining and flora of the intestinal tract. BUT it 's really hard to study the flora of the intestinal tract and average doctors no very little about nutrition aside from ``eat a balanced diet and exercise regularly. '' I do n't mean this disrespectfully, they just do n't get much nutritional education and tend to ignore all but glaring issues. SOOOO, I chose to go off PPIs and work on finding out how to stop my reflux rather than to mask it and accumulate potential risks of medication. My body, my choice. I know the risks of chronic reflux are great, so I would n't do this if I was n't pretty certain I could get rid of the problem through diligence and hard work. Best of luck to all who try and take back their health.######I 'm glad i found your post; i 've been on ppi's a little more than a year and a half; but i 've been doing much btter and decided to stop last week; the last couple ofdays have been burning hell, which started as raw throat... rebound, obviously; i 'm back on te protonix which has alleviated things somewaht, but i really do want to wean off ppis; now i 'm afraid; but i will take your advice, maybe wait a month or so...######OMG you just described all the symptoms that I have been experiencing lately that I never thought were related to my acid-reflux. I have been to 3 different doctors who all said my joint pain and fatigue was the flu, completely disregarding that I ca n't sleep at night without getting up to puke acid... hmm. . I have had my joints checked out and because they are not swollen they said it was mono but a blood test proved otherwise. Thanks for your post!######Thanks for your posts-they have given me hope! I went off nexium 40mg 1x day almost 2 weeks ago. After a week I started having terrible rebound. I have been taking zantac and tums. I do not want to go back on nexium. I agree with your thinking, nexium is a bandaid, watch the foods, etc.. . Anyway is there any tips you can give me to get over the hump? Also, what supplements are you using? Thanks for your help Deb######You are so right about those medications just being like a band-aid. My doctor warned me that the longer I stayed on Nexium the more likely I would get the complications of the GERD which really was n't being treated. He told me the acid is there to buffer the bile that comes out of the digestive tract and if you do n't have it in your stomach then the bile can start digesting your esophagus. He even told me about experiments where they connected bile to the esophagus in animals and got cancer. He says that since the drugs for GERD have come out the number of cancers in the esophagus has skyrocketed.######Another thing, my gastro Dr said to take it only when you are feeling heartburn or reflux, once it has subsided stop. It is like a bandaid, when it hurts take it if you are not feeling the symptoms do n't, and not until you are having another episode. The idea you have to continue taking the drug even if you do n't have symptoms comes from the sales rep and think about it. You will use more if you take daily than if you take it when needed and that 's more money for the drug manufacturer. Granted some people never get relief even when taking it, I 'm like that, but when I stopped taking it daily and stayed away from my triggers, it became a take as needed and I usually only need to take it for 4 days each episode and then I 'm good for a few weeks. Once the esophagus has healed from long term gerd then it can be taken when needed, I 've had two Drs tell me the same thing and one say take it everyday forever! This is a disease that does n't cure itself but can be controlled after much trial and error and you can take other less aggressive OTC acid relief in between bad episodes. I use the acid neutralizers inbetween bad gerd episodes.######I have been on prevacid about 4 years and Nexium around 6, I think (ten years total on meds) for gastric reflux due to a hiatal hernia. About 8 yrs. ago I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and now have chronic anemia-- the hematologist says for some unknown reason I can not absorb iron. I am suspicious that the Nexium is at least part of the problem. There have been recent studies showing that proton pump inhibitor use increases chances for osteopororis, presumably due to hindered calcium absorption. I believe this could also affect iron absorption. I have never heard before about it being difficult to wean off of Nexium. I know if I miss a dose, I am absolutely miserable. I would like to talk to my doctor about getting the Nissen Fundipiclation (sp?) so I could possibly stop taking Nexium, but now I am wondering if that is going to be a solution.######Hi JJ, Thanks for sharing. It 's really scary to think that the drugs we take to make us feel better could be causing us harm when taken long-term. I am on Nexium indefinitelly (until told otherwise, I guess). I do n't think it 's helping me at all. Unfortunately, I have no way to tell for sure. All I know is that I had no GERD symptoms (except for nausea) when I started taking it about seven months ago. After I started taking it, I gradually but in rapid succession developed all of the GERD and LPR symptoms. This certainly makes me wonder if it is possible for this drug to bring about symptomatic GERD or at least exacerbate mild GERD so that it becomes symptomatic. What do you mean by this? I think you have answered your own question. My doctor told me that I can not stop taking the Nexium unless I am prepared to deal with GERD that is much worse than what I have now. Well, I am not, so... I am on Nexium. Do plenty of research if you do decide to take that route. I would n't unless there was no other way and my life depended on it. That 's because someone I know who 's had it done shared his experience with me. This was his advice. He is facing ANOTHER surgery as a result of his failed first one, which resulted in more problems than it cured. On the other hand, there are posters on this board who have had no problems with this procedure. Their input would be very helpful if you decide that is a way to go.######Although I suspect Nexium to be at least partly the cause of my severe anemia, the doctors do not agree and think it is due to heavy periods. My periods are somewhat heavy, but have been all of my life and the anemia has only been a issue for about the last 5 years. So my first step, before considering the Nissen fundiplication is to see what I can do to lighten my menstrual flow. My doctor recommended the Mirena IUD because I have a family history of breast cancer and the hormones are very low in the Mirena. Well, my insurance will not pay for the Mirena, so now the doc said my only other alternative is a uterine ablation. My concern with this is that it can mask uterine cancer in the future. So I need to weigh out paying the full cost of the Mirena IUD versus the ablation and the risks and benefits of each. If this does not help with my anemia, I will be more certain it is the ppi and would consider the surgery then. Even before taking Nexium, my GERD was severe. I had to sleep almost in a full sitting position and still would have trouble. I am not sure if I am worse now when I have missed a Nexium dose because it was always pretty bad.######To all of you who have written about the medication for acid reflux: I was on medication two times a day and found it was nothing but a band aid and for a short time. Went on the Internet and found Digestinol, which is all natural and it has done wonders !!!! Give it the college try.######JJ, What 's this going to do to your anxiety/stress levels? I hope you 'll make the right decision without losing too much sleep over it and getting stressed out. best of luck. FG######I am getting desperate and wondering if any of you have any suggestions. I am 25 and have always had heartburn that has progressively gotten worse. About two years ago I started to get a pain in my breastbone area, and was diagnosed with erosive esophagitis. I have been taking omeprazole, 20 mg once a day for nearly the last two years. I think if I could just get my esophagus to heal and get the pain to go away, I could manage to stay of the PPI's with diet, but I ca n't get the esophagus pain to go completely away. Should I double up on the omeprazole? I 've heard things like aloe vera juice/gel and chewable DGL's can assist in healing the esophagus. Any suggestions? What has worked for you?######Just wondering if you have had an endoscopy to see how bad your esophagus is. You may want to have one done if it seems like it is n't yet healing.######I did get a scope about a year ago, which is where the diagnosis of level 2 esophagitis came from. Their solution seemed to be to take a PPI until it gets better. Well, another year has gone by and it still seems as though it has n't healed. Should I go back to the GI specialist or seek other alternatives?######Hi, Since it has been a year since your last test, I think you should go back and be re-tested. Get them to scope you again. You have nothing to lose. The test will reassure you about the state of your esophagus. You will feel better knowing its condition for sure than when trying to guess what it might be. The test will also help your doctor assess the therapeutic effectiveness of your medication. I ca n't help much- we are all on the same boat, so to speak, looking for answers and hoping for an improvement in our symptoms.

I am very unhappy with the prevacid... though at my 6 week check I did n't hate it near as much as I do now. I have been having horrendous globus at night. When I miss the prevacid, the rebound burning is unbelievable. I am so uncomfortable almost all the time. One night last week I actually popped a nexium i had left over on top of the prevacid... I do n't know what to do other than to go back to my doctor. My doctor wants me to try to come off PPI's next summer. That scares me sooo much. I am terrified of being this uncomfortable or worse. I think that my newest issue is related to the reflux. I am having shortness of breath and wheezing (when breathing and and out) as well as an increased cough. It definitely gets worse when I lie down. I do n't even know why I am posting this. I do n't really want advice... I just want to know someone is going through the same thing. I hate this. All I can think is that I am waayy to young for this to be happening to me and I feel like I 'm falling apart. I just turned 23 years old and I 've been having reflux issues for about 2 years and on medication for 20 months.######hi missa i have LPR and bad stomach issues so even thou my symptoms arent the same i can relate......... if you were on nexium twice a day why arent you on prevacid twice a day as well? you prob need to be covererd for the full 24hrs.... . you could also try losec/proselic as its the orginal ppi and nexium is a copy of it (with something else added or altered) so its very simialar.......... . you could also consider surgery as you are young...... it does have a 90% or so succes rate do some researh on it.... . do you have gerd (heartburn) or just LPR or both the coughing and short of breath is a common acid symptom....... take care ness######I do n't know why I 'm not on Prevacid twice a day. I think my doctor did not think that that was helpful to me for whatever reason. He actually said that I should n't have been taking it as I was. I guess because its supposed to be good for the entire day, maybe? I 'm not sure. I probably would feel a lot better taking the prevacid twice a day. My doctor said I can not go up on medication so much and still have him prescribe it because it is an off-label use and it would need to be prescribed by a specialist and I 'm not currently seeing a GI doc... I guess I should-I did one time, and they seemed uninterested in my reflux and at the time I was also having abdominal pain and cramping almost every time I ate. I had an EGD and was negative for h. pylori on biopsy and no inflammation was seen in my esophagus from the gerd... maybe because of the Nexium I was on at the time. After my EGD I was told to go down on the Nexium to one pill every day instead of two. I ended going back up to two after about a month. I would like to have surgery but it has not been discussed at this point. It would actually make a lot of sense because I am young and otherwise healthy, do not want to be on medications forever and am failing medical treatment. I am on my third PPI and from what I 've heard Nexium and Prevacid are pretty heavy duty. I also have developed an iron deficiency and am bordering on low for my B12... both which I think are due to my medications. I sometimes have heartburn though it is n't my main symptom. Mostly I have a feeling of a lump in my throat and the coughing stuff.######Is your question why you aren taking more Previcide? Okay, I looked them up in one of my drug books. You know that the active ingredient in each is different do n't you? Previcide is lansoprazole and Prilosec is omeprazole. Apparently 15 mg. lansoprazole is equivalent to 20 mg omeprazole, as the usual starter dose of lansoprazole (Previcide) is 15 mg., and the usual starter dose of omeprazole (Prilosec) is 20 mg. You are taking 30 mg. lansoprazole which is twice the usual starting dose. The globus sawllowing is just a symptom of the inflamation of the esophagus caused by the GERD. I have it too and I take omeprazole. I have to take it every day. You have to maintain a therapeutic level of the drug in your system. Hang in there. Good luck.######Well that 's comforting that I 'm at least on the ``right '' dose... even though I 've been on Prevacid for about 10 weeks I 'm still not experiencing relief. Well, I guess I did initially but I have n't for the most part had relief in the last few weeks. I do trust my doctor so I knew there must have been a reason for him doing things the way he did. I still wish I was feeling better though..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

Levels have n't been to bad that I 've caught, but this morning my level was 197 and I have n't ate or drank anything since about 7:30 last night. Any clue why its so high ??######I got type 1 diabetes, and i got a ``condition '' called Dawn Phenomenon (about 80% of all diabetics do, if I remember correctly). It 's when your body produces growth hormone which increases the body's resistance to insulin. In some people it can start as early as 10 pm and sometimes lasts to 10 am (which it does with me). I 'm am higly resistant to insulin at night and I am very sensitive to insulin after about 12 am (which leads to poorly regulated diabetes). So I almost always have too high blood sugar in the morning (it 's almost always about 12- 14 mmol/L, 216- 252 mg/dl). Here is a link for you to read about it (url) http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/article.cfm?aid=1023[/url] Take care######The other thing I would like to mention is to be very careful to have clean hands when you test your sugar. This can throw your reading way off. It takes very little contaminant in the small drop of blood being tested to alter the result significantly.######Everyone has dawn phenomenon. It is your body's way of preparing for the day. At some time during the night or early morning your body puts out glucose so that there will be energy available when you get up. For some people it is only a mild elevation and for others it is quite significant. Because it is only an issue for people with diabetes, it is often mentioned in conjuction with diabetes, but everyone has it to some extent or another. Cora######Tinkerbell, Were you at one time hypoglycemic? Just curious, because hypoglycemia is often a precursor to T2 diabetes, and I was thinking that if in fact you had been, maybe your blood sugar actually went too low at sometime during the night, triggering your liver to release glycogen to raise the blood sugar. This is called ``rebound effect '' and causes high blood sugar in the am. Even if you were n't ever hypoglycemic, try setting your alarm for around 3 AM and testing your blood sugar at that time. If it 's quite low (below 60, especially), then what you 're experiencing is rebound, and the way to prevent it is to have a light snack before bedtime. Ruth######Yes, that 's true. But not everyone with diabetes has problems with it, becuase it 's not so severe in everyone, as i said about 80% have minor to greater problems with it. So i only metioned it, so she could look it up to see maybe her cause to why her blood sugar was high in the morning, as the question was..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With Type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes may include fatigue, thirst, weight loss, blurred vision and frequent urination. Some people have no symptoms. A blood test can show if you have diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.######Great! So, do you recommend standard medications (drugs)?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes

I guess my A1c test was high. Does this mean that I have diabetes? Thanks! She said my thyroid test was also high, are they connected in any way?######No, the diabetes is the liver connection. Thyroid is located elsewhere and not related. Best to get with the doctor and get information from the tests and what it all actually means. Good luck.######This is a copy and paste from journal.diabetes.org:######Hi there, Rainbowdawn, At a basic level, they are connected in that are both endocrine disorders, with diabetes being the most common. A high A1C probably means you 've encroached into the world of diabetes on some level but the key is understanding where you are at. Diabetes treatments run the gammut from making better lifestyle choices to having to supply your body with insulin. Try not to be nervous as 97% fall into the lifestyle category. Taking many things into account, your doctor is the best person to explain the best course of action to get you back on track. Elevated thyroid levels could signal something going on and, like diabetes, types & treatments run the gammut with many being extremely common. But again, your doctor is the best person to put things into perspective. I 've been hypothyroid for 20 years and diagnosed Type1 diabetic this Jan05. and I 'm 37 y/o. I 'm not sure exactly how they are connected scientifically (other than metabolically/cellularly) but my Endocrinologist is the one who determines my medication levels for both thyroid meds and insulin levels. Until I went Type1 (requiring the need of a specialist), I was always treated by my family doctor who followed practiced guidelines. Some background on thyroid & diabetes: Diabetes is correctly divided into two major subgroups: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. This division is based upon whether the blood sugar problem is caused by insulin deficiency (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2). Insulin deficiency means there is not enough insulin being made by the pancreas due to a malfunction of their insulin producing cells. Insulin resistance occurs when there is plenty of insulin made by the pancreas (it is functioning normally and making plenty of insulin) but the cells of the body are resistant to it 's action which results in the blood sugar being too high. The sole function of the thyroid is to make thyroid hormone. This hormone has an effect on nearly all tissues of the body where it increases cellular activity. The function of the thyroid therefore is to regulate the body's metabolism. So, take heart in that, while you may be having to look at some lifestyle changes, all will be well. Hope this helps some. Cheers,- Vikingirl######What a nice, encouraging and down to earth reply, Vikingirl! More of this type of posting is needed, I do believe; too much doom and gloom and trying to scare people of their minds going on around here.

Meals should be eaten at approximately the same time every day. Meals and snacks should be planned in conjunction with the insulin dose and the person's planned level of physical activity. The amount and type of food, and the carbohydrate, protein, and fat content of meals and snacks, should be consistent from day to day. This helps with the delicate balance of carbohydrate intake, insulin, and physical activity that is necessary for optimal blood levels of a sugar called glucose. If these components are not in balance, there can be wide variations, from too high to too low, in blood glucose levels. With type 2 diabetes, the main focus is on weight management and weight control, because 80% to 90% of people with this disease are overweight. A calorie-controlled meal plan is recommended, along with appropriate physical activity. In many cases, weight control and a planned diet alone control diabetes. Some people with type 2 diabetes must also take oral medications. Edit######A dismal two-thirds of the nation's 18 million type 2 diabetics do n't have their blood sugar under control, putting them at high risk of the disease's nastiest complications, even death. Yet most are unaware they 're doing so poorly, frustrated diabetes specialists said wednesday. Edit######It is helpful..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes
894	62	5c623249c061d6b8ea5adb15	http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic84.html	1	Diabetes Overview.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes######What Is Diabetes? Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes. ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Points to Remember What is diabetes? a disorder of metabolism-- the way the body digests food for energy and growth What are the main types of diabetes? type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes gestational diabetes What is the impact of diabetes? affects 17 million people is a leading cause of death and disability costs$ 132 billion per year Who gets diabetes? people of any age people with a family history of diabetes most common in older people, overweight and sedentary people, African Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans ------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------- Where Is More Information Available?

Diabetes is a disorder of metabolism-- the way our bodies use digested food for growth and energy. Most of the food we eat is broken down into glucose, the form of sugar in the blood. Glucose is the main source of fuel for the body. After digestion, glucose passes into the bloodstream, where it is used by cells for growth and energy. For glucose to get into cells, insulin must be present. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. When we eat, the pancreas is supposed to automatically produce the right amount of insulin to move glucose from blood into our cells. In people with diabetes, however, the pancreas either produces little or no insulin, or the cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. Glucose builds up in the blood, overflows into the urine, and passes out of the body. Thus, the body loses its main source of fuel even though the blood contains large amounts of glucose. What Are the Types of Diabetes? The three main types of diabetes are Type 1 diabetes Type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease results when the body's system for fighting infection (the immune system) turns against a part of the body. In diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas and destroys them. The pancreas then produces little or no insulin. Someone with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin daily to live. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the beta cells, but they believe that autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, possibly viruses, are involved. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of diagnosed diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes develops most often in children and young adults, but the disorder can appear at any age. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop over a short period, although beta cell destruction can begin years earlier. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, constant hunger, weight loss, blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. If not diagnosed and treated with insulin, a person can lapse into a life-threatening diabetic coma, also known as diabetic ketoacidosis. Type 2 diabetes The most common form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. About 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes have type 2. This form of diabetes usually develops in adults age 40 and older and is most common in adults over age 55. About 80 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Type 2 diabetes is often part of a metabolic syndrome that includes obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high levels of blood lipids. Unfortunately, as more children and adolescents become overweight, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in young people. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin, but, for unknown reasons, the body can not use the insulin effectively, a condition called insulin resistance. After several years, insulin production decreases. The result is the same as for type 1 diabetes-- glucose builds up in the blood and the body can not make efficient use of its main source of fuel. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes develop gradually. They are not as sudden in onset as in type 1 diabetes. Some people have no symptoms. Symptoms may include fatigue or nausea, frequent urination, unusual thirst, weight loss, blurred vision, frequent infections, and slow healing of wounds or sores. Gestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes develops only during pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, it occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, and people with a family history of diabetes. Though it usually disappears after delivery, the mother is at increased risk of getting type 2 diabetes later in life. What Tests Are Recommended for Diagnosing Diabetes? The fasting plasma glucose test is the preferred test for diagnosing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a diagnosis of diabetes is made for any one of three positive tests, with a second positive test on a different day: A random plasma glucose value (taken any time of day) of 200 mg/dL or more, along with the presence of diabetes symptoms. A plasma glucose value of 126 mg/dL or more, after a person has fasted for 8 hours. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose value of 200 mg/dL or more in the blood sample, taken 2 hours after a person has consumed a drink containing 75 grams of glucose dissolved in water. This test, taken in a laboratory or the doctor's office, measures plasma glucose at timed intervals over a 3-hour period. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed based on plasma glucose values measured during the OGTT. Glucose levels are normally lower during pregnancy, so the threshold values for diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy are lower. If a woman has two plasma glucose values meeting or exceeding any of the following numbers, she has gestational diabetes: a fasting plasma glucose level of 95 mg/dL, a 1-hour level of 180 mg/dL, a 2-hour level of 155 mg/dL, or a 3-hour level of 140 mg/dL. What Are the Other Forms of Impaired Glucose Metabolism, Also Called Prediabetes? People with prediabetes, a state between ``normal '' and ``diabetes, '' are at risk for developing diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes. About 16 million people ages 40 to 74 in the United States have prediabetes. There are two forms of prediabetes. Impaired Fasting Glucose A person has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) when fasting plasma glucose is 110 to 125 mg/dL. This level is higher than normal but less than the level indicating a diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired Glucose Tolerance Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) means that blood glucose during the oral glucose tolerance test is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. IGT is diagnosed when the glucose level is 141 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after a person is given a drink containing 75 grams of glucose. What Are the Scope and Impact of Diabetes? Diabetes is widely recognized as one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. In 1999, about 450,000 deaths occurred among adults with diabetes. Diabetes is associated with long-term complications that affect almost every part of the body. The disease often leads to blindness, heart and blood vessel disease, strokes, kidney failure, amputations, and nerve damage. Uncontrolled diabetes can complicate pregnancy, and birth defects are more common in babies born to women with diabetes. In 2002, diabetes cost the United States$ 132 billion. Indirect costs, including disability payments, time lost from work, and premature death, totaled$ 40.2 billion; direct medical costs for diabetes care, including hospitalizations, medical care, and treatment supplies, totaled$ 91.8 billion. Who Gets Diabetes? Diabetes is not contagious. People can not ``catch '' it from each other. However, certain factors can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs equally among males and females, but is more common in whites than in nonwhites. Data from the World Health Organization's Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes indicate that type 1 diabetes is rare in most African, American Indian, and Asian populations. However, some northern European countries, including Finland and Sweden, have high rates of type 1 diabetes. The reasons for these differences are not known. Type 2 diabetes is more common in older people, especially in people who are overweight, and occurs more often in African Americans, American Indians, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, and Hispanic Americans. On average, non-Hispanic African Americans are twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of the same age. Hispanic Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. American Indians have the highest rates of diabetes in the world. Among the Pima Indians living in Arizona, for example, half of all adults have type 2 diabetes. On average, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.6 times as likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. Although prevalence data for diabetes among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is limited, some groups, such as Native Hawaiians, are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes as white residents of Hawaii. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is likely to increase for several reasons. First, a large segment of the population is aging. Also, Hispanic Americans and other minority groups make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Finally, Americans are increasingly overweight and sedentary. According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is predicted to be 8.9 percent of the population by 2025. How Is Diabetes Managed? Before the discovery of insulin in 1921, everyone with type 1 diabetes died within a few years after diagnosis. Although insulin is not considered a cure, its discovery was the first major breakthrough in diabetes treatment. Today, healthy eating, physical activity, and insulin via injection or an insulin pump are the basic therapies for type 1 diabetes. The amount of insulin must be balanced with food intake and daily activities. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored through frequent blood glucose checking. Healthy eating, physical activity, and blood glucose testing are the basic management tools for type 2 diabetes. In addition, many people with type 2 diabetes require oral medication and insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with diabetes must take responsibility for their day-to-day care. Much of the daily care involves keeping blood glucose levels from going too low or too high. When blood glucose levels drop too low from certain diabetes medicines-- a condition known as hypoglycemia-- a person can become nervous, shaky, and confused. Judgment can be impaired. If blood glucose falls too low, a person can faint. A person can also become ill if blood glucose levels rise too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. People with diabetes should see a doctor who helps them learn to manage their diabetes and monitors their diabetes control. An endocrinologist is one type of doctor who may specialize in diabetes care. In addition, people with diabetes often see ophthalmologists for eye examinations, podiatrists for routine foot care, and dietitians and diabetes educators to help teach the skills of day-to-day diabetes management. The goal of diabetes management is to keep blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as safely possible. A major study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), showed that keeping blood glucose levels as close to normal as safely possible reduces the risk of developing major complications of type 1 diabetes. The 10-year study, completed in 1993, included 1,441 people with type 1 diabetes. The study compared the effect of two treatment approaches-- intensive management and standard management-- on the development and progression of eye, kidney, and nerve complications of diabetes. Intensive treatment aimed at keeping hemoglobin A-1-c as close to normal (6 percent) as possible. Hemoglobin A-1-c reflects average blood sugar over a 2- to 3-month period. Researchers found that study participants who maintained lower levels of blood glucose through intensive management had significantly lower rates of these complications. More recently, a followup study of DCCT participants showed that the ability of intensive control to lower the complications of diabetes persists up to 4 years after the trial ended. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a European study completed in 1998, showed that intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure reduced the risk of blindness, kidney disease, stroke, and heart attack in people with type 2 diabetes.######What Is the Status of Diabetes Research? NIDDK conducts research in its own laboratories and supports a great deal of basic and clinical research in medical centers and hospitals throughout the United States. It also gathers and analyzes statistics about diabetes. Other Institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research on diabetes-related eye diseases, heart and vascular complications, pregnancy, and dental problems. Other Government agencies that sponsor diabetes programs are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense. Many organizations outside of the Government support diabetes research and education activities. These organizations include the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, and the American Association of Diabetes Educators. In recent years, advances in diabetes research have led to better ways to manage diabetes and treat its complications. Major advances include The development of a quick-acting insulin analog. Better ways to monitor blood glucose and for people with diabetes to check their own blood glucose levels. Development of external insulin pumps that deliver insulin, replacing daily injections. Laser treatment for diabetic eye disease, reducing the risk of blindness. Successful transplantation of kidneys and pancreas in people whose own kidneys fail because of diabetes. Better ways of managing diabetes in pregnant women, improving chances of successful outcomes. New drugs to treat type 2 diabetes and better ways to manage this form of diabetes through weight control. Evidence that intensive management of blood glucose reduces and may prevent development of diabetes complications. Demonstration that antihypertensive drugs called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors prevent or delay kidney failure in people with diabetes. Promising results with islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes reported by the University of Alberta in Canada. A nationwide clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International is currently trying to replicate the Canadian advance. Evidence that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes can lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. What Will the Future Bring? In the future, it may be possible to administer insulin through inhalers, a pill, or a patch. Devices are also being developed that can monitor blood glucose levels without having to prick a finger to get a blood sample. Researchers continue to search for the cause or causes of diabetes and ways to prevent and cure the disorder. Scientists are looking for genes that may be involved in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Some genetic markers for type 1 diabetes have been identified, and it is now possible to screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to see if they are at risk. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-- Type 1 (DPT-1) identifies relatives at risk for developing type 1 diabetes and treats them with an oral form of insulin in the hope of preventing type 1 diabetes. In the same study, researchers recently completed a separate trial in which they found that low-dose insulin injections do not prevent type 1 diabetes in relatives of people with type 1 diabetes. For more information, call 1-800-HALT-DM1 (1-800-425-8361) or see www.niddk.nih.gov/patient/dpt_1/dpt_1.htm on the Internet. The DPT-1 is funded by the NIDDK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Center for Research Resources within the National Institutes of Health as well as the American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. Transplantation of the pancreas or insulin-producing beta cells offers the best hope of cure for people with type 1 diabetes. Some pancreas transplants have been successful. However, people who have transplants must take powerful drugs to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. These drugs are costly and may eventually cause other health problems. Scientists are working to develop less harmful drugs and better methods of transplanting beta cells to prevent rejection by the body. Using techniques of bioengineering, researchers are also trying to create artificial beta cells that secrete insulin in response to increased glucose levels in the blood. Recently, researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, announced promising results with islet transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes. At the time of the report in the New England Journal of Medicine, all seven patients who had received the transplant remained free of insulin injections up to 14 months after the procedure. A clinical trial funded by the NIH and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International will try to replicate the Edmonton advance. With the insights gained from this trial and other studies, scientists hope to further refine methods of islet harvesting and transplantation and learn more about the immune processes that affect rejection and acceptance of transplanted islets. In 1996, NIDDK launched its Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of this research effort was to learn how to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The findings of the DPP, which were released in August 2001, showed that people at high risk for type 2 diabetes could sharply lower their chances of developing the disease through diet and exercise. In addition, treatment with the oral diabetes drug metformin also reduced diabetes risk, though less dramatically. Participants randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. On average, this group maintained their physical activity at 30 minutes per day, usually with walking or other moderate intensity exercise, and lost 5 to 7 percent of their body weight. Participants randomized to treatment with metformin reduced their risk of getting type 2 diabetes by 31 percent. Of the 3,234 participants enrolled in the DPP, 45 percent were from minority groups that suffer disproportionately from type 2 diabetes: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. The trial also recruited other groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, including individuals age 60 and older, women with a history of gestational diabetes, and people with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes. Several new drugs have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes. By using the oral diabetes medications now available, many people can control blood glucose levels without insulin injections. Studies are under way to determine how best to use these drugs to manage type 2 diabetes. Scientists also are investigating strategies for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes.

896	62	5cc38c1ec061d64ea4994c8d	http://www.healthboards.com/boards/diabetes/585743-does-my-hubby-have-diabetes-please-help.html	1	Does my hubby have diabetes? Please help!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes######For the past few months my hubby has not been himself. He is tired all the time, and since mid December has been constantly thirsty. He ca n't get enough to drink. Several trips throughout the day to the bathroom, (but would n't that be from all the liquids he drinks?) His vision goes blurry, he gets very shakey, and sometimes he says he feels like he is going to pass out. No energy. While shopping last night I picked up a blood glucose test meter. We waited until this morning to do the test. He did n't have anything to eat or drink for 9 hours so we could get the proper results. The meter came up with ``510 ''. The test said if it is below 20 or higher then 600 a warning would appear letting him know it was too low or too high. We do n't know what a normal level should be. The test does n't really tell us. We did the test again about an hour after he ate lunch and it was ``471 ''. I did the test also to see what would happen and mine said ``80 '' in the morning and ``105 '' after lunch. He is 54 years old and NEVER been to a family Dr. because of not having any health insurance.Today I called all over to find a Dr. that will accept new patients without insurance. After 3 hrs. I found one who made an appt. but not until March 25. I even explained how worried I am about him. No one seemed to care. If he would of had insurance, they would have glady seen him. Can someone please tell us what a normal reading should be and your opinions on his symptoms? Thank you!######I do n't mean to scare you. But I would STRONGLY suggest you take your husband to a hospital emmergency room IMMEDIATELY. A lot of his other blood chemistries could also be out of whack and life threatening. It is possible that he may just get sent home with a prescription for glyburide, but please, you are better safe than sorry. These numbers are life threatening from what I understand. Please do not wait for the dr's appt. Go to the hospital. His numbers are extremely high. Anything above 126 is abnormal and these are life threatening values, again, from what I understand.######Normal is more in the range you saw on yourself, a bit higher would also be normal. In terms of symptoms, frequent urination is a symptom. I am not a Dr but my understanding is that where your blood sugar is too high, your kidneys try to dump some of the sugar out through urine. So you pee a lot. This dehydrates you and you are thirsty. I do n't know if you measured properly but if so, 510 and 471 would be very high. Can you continue looking for another doctor sooner? Is there not another medical service you can get help with?######I agree with Uma... your husband should go to the nearest emergency room. With blood sugars running that high, he could be in diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. While there, ask if he would qualify for uncompensated care (most hospitals have a fund to help take care of people who do n't have health insurance and are in financial straits but still need urgent medical care.) A non-diabetic's blood sugars would never go that high, even after eating a high-carb meal. Normal range is between 70 and 140, never higher. Your husband is definitely diabetic... question is, whether it 's type 1 or type 2, and the only way to tell is through some blood tests. Ruth######Yes, that would indicate diabetes, probably type 2, given his age, meaning he has resistance to his own insulin. He needs to see a doctor or go to the hospital asap to get his blood glucose in control. Normal blood glucose is between 70 and 120, so 520 is very high. Meters read ``HI '' when over 600, but that warning is just indicating extremely severe highs. Good luck, and do not let this slide so as to prevent any complications.######Finally talked hubby into going to the ER instead of waiting for Dr. appt. He does have type 2 diabetes. He did n't have any ketones which they said was a good thing. His glucose level while we were there was 296. They gave him a prescription for Metaformin. They set him up with a follow-up Dr. for this Thursday. I just want to thank e `one for telling me he should go to the ER. I was really scared for him. He 's been on the med. for 2 days but his numbers are still in the 200's. Anyone have any idea how long this med. takes to start working? Thank you all again!######Everyone is different but met can take weeks to kick in full effect. If I remember well they said as much as 4 to 6 weeks. When I started it was n't doing anything and I read it COULD take several weeks. It will slowly start to make a difference. Was it his morning levels that were so bad or after eating? In the mean time, go easy on the carbs and drink lots of water.######Not really sure if he is overweight, but probably is. . He is 6 ' 1 '' and weighs 255 pounds He 's gained 25 pounds since Sept' 07. Thats when he quit smoking (cold turkey) and took up eating candy. . tons of it! Around Nov./ Dec. is when he started feeling really bad. . (But since not feeling well he 's been losing weight) The ER did n't give us a diet plan or anything to follow before his Dr. appt. on Thursday, so I had to go online and look it up. I know the med. is making him even more sicker to his stomach, cramps, and diarrhea. I guess thats a normal side effect from what I have read about it and just to stick with it because you will feel worse before you get better ??? His reading this morning before breakfast was 189, the lowest it 's been since we started monitoring it a few days ago. Exercise. . yes, my hubby wants the both of us to start going for walks. We will ask the Dr. about it first. He 's a bricklayer and ca n't wait for spring to settle in so he can return to work. But mostly, all he keeps saying is. . ``I hope I get better ''. He 's very worried about not having insurance and not being able to work if he does n't get feeling better. Hopefully things will work out somehow.######If he is in fact Type2, the metformin will start having an effect after about 3 weeks. But if he is Type1, metformin wo n't do him any good and he will steadily get worse. The fact that the onset has been so quick, blood sugars of 500 + have been recorded, and he has lost weight suggest that it could be Type1. So watch it carefully.######He was diagnosed with type 2.######Sheila, From what I have heard and read, the side effects from metformin do go away after a while, but if they become intolerable, the best way to manage is to start from the beginning, with a very small dose, and then increase it gradually over a period of several weeks. Do n't know how much he 's taking, so ca n't tell if he 's on a large dose already or not. This is something you can work out with his doctor. Ruth######Thank you Ruth. He is on 500mg, 3 times a day.######There are people who 's pancreas produces no insulin. They are type 1. There are people who produce insulin but their body does n't use it well. They are type 2. And there are people in between who do n't produce quite enough or who 's body barely make due with what they produce. There are people borderline between the two. The progression of one to another sometimes occurs with age Doctors will try and use metformin and if your husband does n't get good control, they will try other medications and may eventually prescribe the use of insulin. Metformin is usually the first attempt. If it does n't work, there are several other weapons in the arsenal. I guess theoretically the minute you use insulin you are type 1. NIDDM is ``non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus '' (type2). IDDM is ``insulin depenant diabetes mellitus '' (type 1). I does n't really matter if he is type 1 or 2. The important thing is for him to get control, and if to do so, means insulin injections, so be it. They are not the end of the world, just think of them as a different form of medication. But for now, listen to the Dr. Metformin does a couple of things. I allows the insulin your husband has (assuming he is producing some) more efficiently. It also reduces the amount of sugar his liver produces. If he is responding to metformin, the chances are he does have some insulin production left. If it 's enough is to be determined. But remember, if not, insulin injections are not the end of the world. I hope this info helps. If it 's just annoying, let me know######I feel the need to correct a misconception here. Type1 Diabetes and Type2 Diabetes are clinically diseases and need to be treated in different ways. Type1 is an autoimmune disorder, whereas Type2 is the result of insulin resistance. While you ca n't progress from the one to the other, it is possible to have both Type1 and Type2 at the same time. The problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between them in the early stages, and Type 1 is often mis-diagnosed as Type 2. If the diagnosis was not based on insulin level and antibody test results, it could be wrong. As I mentioned in the previous post, normal weight, weight loss and very high blood glucose readings suggest that this could be the case. The fact there were no ketones could just mean that the pancreas is still producing enough insulin to stop this from happening. But things change fast in the onset of T1. And treating Type1 with type2 oral medications accelerates onset of the disease. Most importantly, these medications wo n't stop the development of ketoacidosis, which is dangerous condition. This is why it needs to be watched carefully at this stage.######Could n't have said it better myself, Mark! Also, even if T2 progresses to the point where one is insulin-dependent (as I am), it is STILL T2, not T1. It 's just T2 with a completely worn-out pancreas. Ruth######Unfortunately not all doctors and litterature use the terms the way you do. Some refer to type 1 as insulin dependent (IDDM) and type 2 as non insulin dependent (NIDDM). They seem to classify the result, i.e ``do I need insulin ''. You have classified them, as some doctors and litterature by the underlying issue, ie deterioration of the beta cells in the pancreas vs deterioration of the bodies ability to use insulin, that may lean to a burn out of insulin production. In your language, is IDDM type 1 and NIDDM type 2 or are those terms meaningless?######No, Type1 is not equal to IDDM and Type2 is not equal to NIDDM. And yes, it is unfortunate that the terminology has become so confusing. I think it highlights the shortcomings of defining a disease by its symptomatic characteristics. It makes much more sense to define a disease in terms of what causes it. But up until the 1970's, the distinction between the respective causes of what we now know as Type1 and Type2 diabetes were not well understood. So it was easier to call them IDDM and NIDDM. The terms Juvenile Onset Diabetes and Maturity Onset Diabetes were used for similar reasons. Things have changed a lot over the last 30 years. It is not uncommon for young people to become insulin resistant and for older people to have an autoimmune attack on their beta cells. It is also common for someone with insulin resistance to lose all beta cell function and become totally dependent on injected insulin (like Ruth). Also consider that an insulin dependent T2 is not the same as a T1 (who is also insulin dependent). The presence of insulin resistance means that additional treatment options may have to be considered. The net effect is that those old terms have lost their descriptive exclusivity. This is why usage of the IDDM/NIDDM and Juvenile/Maturity Onset Diabetes terminology has been superseded by ``Type1 '' and ``Type2 '' diabetes. These terms are both well understood in terms of the respective etiology, and the risk of mis-diagnosis has been brought into focus. This is what I was commenting on in the earlier post. It is easy to misdiagnose a T1 as T2 in the early stages. Doctors still use age and size as diagnostic guidelines and do n't do the required tests. Use of the old terms, IMO, is not helpful and just causes a lot of confusion. Mark######To highlight the lack of clarity, this from the definition page of the canadian diabetes association. (url) http://www.diabetes.ca/Section_About/dictionary.asp[/url] TYPE 1 DIABETES (or insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas no longer produces any or very little insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar as an energy source. Type 1 diabetes usually develops in childhood or adolescence and affects 10% of people with diabetes. TYPE 2 DIABETES (or non-insulin-dependent diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs or the insulin is not metabolized effectively. Type 2 usually occurs later in life and affects 90% of people with diabetes..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Doctor called me and said my sugar readings were high and she want me to come in and we will discuss options, so I will see her on Wednesday of next week. My question is this, what do they generally start with for controlling type 2 diabetes? Medications or insulin or what? I know a big change of diet and excerise is a couple of things. but what else? thanks######Diet and exercise is 1st. Depending on levels of blood sugars, many times docs start w/ metformin. (makes you more sensitive to the insulin you produce and stops hepatic glucose production). TZDs like Actos or Avandia are sometimes added next or sometimes as a starter if metformin cant be used. They take 12 weeks to take full effect. No matter what, you need to decide to change your eating habits and try to exercise. Loosing weight and exercise is the key to staying off meds. Good health to you.######I have experience with an alternative product that is a herbal formula called Combetic. It will keep your blood sugars at a normal level and you will not have to go on drugs or insulin..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Just found out that my two sisters have diabetes, and hoping I do n't. Can someone tell me what your first symptoms were of diabetes. My sister said that she would get hot and sweaty and could n't lose weight.######Hot, sweaty, and not able to lose weight are not symptoms of diabetes. Weight loss, palore, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue are symptoms.######Okay thanks, I thought that not being able to lose weight was not one of the symptoms.######Lady50, I read in a Diabetes journal that there is a connection between Diabetes and NOT being able to lose weight. I know for myself, I tried different approaches to losing weight but did n't get results. Since recently being told I 'm Diabetic I started to watch my carb intake and carb mixtures for the past month to have control of my sugar numbers and already seen a reduction in my weight. It may be more of eating a healthier low carb diet but I also think since my sugar is at a steady pace- it 's easier for me to get the weight off. \* I also do get hot and sweaty but I 'm 46- that 's just plain ol' mother nature. PollyAnn######The not being able to lose weight may be what causes Type 2, but it is definitely not a symptom of diabetes. When you have diabetes, you are n't able to properly use carbohydrates for energy, so you urinate them out. This basically results in your peeing out your number 1 energy source, forcing your body to burn fat rapidly. Therefore, weight loss is a symptom.######Thats not exactly it but close. The Problem comes from No Insulin. Type 1 Diabetics will ofton see the weight loss but Type2's usually wont. When there is not any insulin in the body at all the body cant do many things, Insulin is responsible for Moving Glucos from the Blood stream to where it is needed. Which includes to Glycogen for energy and to fat for storage. Without any insulin the body also cant rebuild muscle as it gets broken up when used. So you end up losing tons of muscle. Unfortunately many Type 2 Diabetics actually do not experience any symptoms at all.######I visited a Diabetes Support group and the first thing I noticed was that everyone there was overweight. My thoughts were `is this the way I 'm heading with my Diabetes'. I have about 25lbs to lose but these people were a lot heavier. I went to gain knowledge from others that are in the same boat but at first I felt a little odd. Everyone was very nice, had different types of Diabetes and ranged in all ages. There was a 13-year-old girl who takes insulin and even she was overweight. Does insulin cause you to gain weight? I also learned from this group that most everyone has other serious issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure and lung problems. And the women in the late 40's age said they were dealing with Menopause symptoms and think possibly that Diabetes is making the symptoms worst for both their Diabetes and Menopause. It was n't the place for me but it 's nice that there are such place for support.######I agree type 2 diabetics do n't always show weight loss or any symptoms at all, but I do n't believe only people with type 1 experience weight loss. My pathophysiology text book lists weight loss as a symptoms for both types. Type 1s will lose more weight for the reasons you mentioned, but they will overall have more symptoms since their blood sugar will raise at a much more rapid pace. Once blood sugars reach over 180, most people will be peeing out glucose, since that is generally the renal threshold for glucose.######Thank you all so much. I have another question, hope ya all do n't mind. Right now I am like dead broke, and wanted to get a diabetes test since 2 sisters of mine have it. I was thinking of going to the local Health Department and get a finger \*\*\*\*\* blood sugar test. Do you think this test would detect diabetes in me. If your bloodsugar is quite high, does that mean diabetes. I have read that urinalysis is a good test, since there should be no sugar in the urine. This finger \*\*\*\*\* bloodtest will only cost me 3 bucks.######correction: should have said finger poke instead of the other word.LOLLOL######If both your sisters have it, I would think the easiest way to detect it would be asking one of them to test you. If it 's high, my suggestion to you is to get health insurance before you get diagnosed by a doctor.######It 's all very confusing to me. I thought Diabetes I was when your body ca n't produce insulin at ALL. that 's why it has to be injected. Type II diabetes is totally different and it 's not insulin that they 're taking by pill form. the medication they take by pill form helps regualte their blood sugar in type II. Insulin ca n't be produced in pill form. only with injection. type II can be cured by changing the diet. It 's proven. It 's very technical and can be down right confusing. hypoglycemia, vs reactive hypoglycemia is different from eachother too. I need a good book to describe and illistrate to me in detail what each one is. in laymans terms or dummy form like they make dummy books for computers. the longer I go with having low blood sugar attacks, the worst my being able to understand anything in an orderly fashion is diminishing. it 's very frustrating. maybe there 's a book out there in the market for me. anyone have any suggestions? Linda######There are several types of diabetes. type 1- the immune system attacks it 's own pancreas. This results in the insulin producing cells no longer being able to produce insulin. The blood glucose raises rapidly and dangerously. As no insulin is present, external insulin must be provided through injection or a pump. type 2- this is a bit more complicated. In type two, for some reason, the cells stop responding to the insulin being produced. Basically, insulin acts as the gatekeeper for the cells, allowing glucose to enter the body cells. Think of it as the gatekeeper falling asleep on the job. To make up for this, ``reinforcements '' are sent in. The body just keeps making more insulin so blood glucose can be maintained at a somewhat normal level, though the level does raise. Eventually, the body ca n't make any more insulin, so lack of insulin production becomes a sign of type 2 at some point in time. Gestational- basically in this one, the fetus takes all the glucose away from mom's body. So mom's body tries to not store glucose, but keep it all in the blood instead. The glucose raises. Also, some resistance is present due to the added weight. MODY- maturity onset diabetes of youth. This is a rare genetic form of diabetes. Basically, the body is born not being able to make enough insulin (but it makes some), and it gets worse with age. Diet and exercise can be used at first, then meds, then insulin. LADA- latent onset autoimmune diabetes of adults. Think of this as an adult getting Type 1. It 's a form of type 1 diabetes, but the onset is slower and at an older age.######update: My sister checked my bloodsugar with the finger poke bloodtester. Before I ate, it was 140, after eating it was 117. A few hours later, it dropped down to 57. This is when I was feeling a bit shakey inside.Then I was craving sweets like mad. This is weird that it dropped so low.######Sounds like reactive hypoglycemia.######Thank you for helping me with this. I will be looking that up..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes
899	62	5c6330a0c061d660adabefc5	http://ehealthforum.com/health/topic65793.html	1	Ok, This Is Stupid....######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy######I know this is a lot of crap to read, please bear with me... I went to the diabetes center yesterday to get a monitor and have them show me how to use it. I 'm supposed to check my blood sugar levels 4 times a day: before breakfast and 2 hours after each meal. When I went in, it was three hours after I had eaten, but we took it anyway and recorded it like it had been 2. It was 109. Now, the guidelines she gave me says I do n't want it to be above 120 at the 2-hours-after mark. So 109 is pretty significantly lower (i think), but I did n't think much about it because it had been an extra hour. I took it again two hours after dinner, and it was 92. This morning it was 70. I do n't know what the morning number is supposed to be, but that still seems low to me. My fasting number, which is pretty much the same thing, when I took the glucose test was 96, and the nurse commented on how ``great '' that was because it was so low. But 70? Maybe I do n't know anything, but those numbers seem really low to me. I do n't want to call and be freaking out or anything until I have a full day of testing under my belt, but I was wondering if anybody here knew anything about it. How low is too low? Should I be concerned?######I just took my three hour long glucose test yesterday and im worried that it will come back bad. Pretty sure it will. I dont know if I can freaking prick my fingers like that... Ahhhh makes me queasy thinking about it. The dr said it can get so worse as to inject insulin too ??? I hope you find out your answers = 0 \############I dont know a week ago I took the hour long test, they took my blood I drank the nasty sprite stuff. . Waited an hour and they took my blood the test came back bad so I had to do the same thing but for three hours and they took my blood 4 times, once before and once every hour into the test up till the fourth hour. They didnt do that with you?######Yes, they did. But what i 'm saying is that when they prick your finger, they know within seconds what your sugar levels are. They should n't be making you wait to get the results; they knew the results when you were sitting right there. It 's not like they have to send bloodwork to a lab or something. Heck, I knew before the last prick on my three-hour test that I had failed it because I was already high on two of the numbers.######Oh I havent pricked my finger yet I just took the four hour test yesterday and they said if any two of them come back high I have gestational diabities which im pretty sure they will. I used to have highinsulin a few years ago when I was overweight so thats why the dr wanted to do this test early. Also every single time I eat I get tired and when I stand everything goes black. Something tells me its all connected. I should find out in a few days how the test came out and when I do she said that I have to come in and learn about all that pricking and stuff, see a dietition and some kind of group thing.######Yes, they have pricked your finger. If you did the glucose tolerance test, that 's what they do... Besides, you said they pricked your finger. Each time they prick your finger during that test, they are checking to see if your blood sugar levels are within a certain range. If it 's too high, then that 's bad. They would have known when they did the test if your levels were too high, there is nothing to ``wait '' on. Anyway... Someone * please * answer my question ?????######They took a tube of blood each time from my arm, the never pricked my finder. Hope you get your answer######That 's weird. Anyway, good luck to you. I 'm sure everything will be ok either way.######When I had my 1hr they pricked my finger... But when I had my three hour they drew 4 tubes of blood. I still go my results the next day. Didnt' need to worry abut it. When I had fainting spells they checked my blood and told me that I needed to make sure I ate something like an apple and drink a clear soda... It always made me feel better right away. They gave me the moniter too and as long as it was above 60 I was ok. But now I don; t have the spells anymore and I do n't have to prick my finger anymore.############My grandmother is diabetic and its disgusting now I know pregnancy induced diabetes is different and does go away 95% if you take care of urself this is what I do know some of it is from hubby... Carbs are really bad (basically they are spoons of sugar but come out later) taters, anything bread, carrots pretzels, chip etc naturals sugars you eat in halves so have half an apple in the morning the other in the afternoon just as an example. Make sure ur meals are complete 1/4 of ur plate should have stuff from every food group besides that ur about average for blood sugar 109 is quite high and 70 is kinda playing it on the average-normal side. Best of luck lalee just as an fyi for anyone if you have gestational diabete and do not take care of urself/eat healthy/moderation/diet it is very possible your diabetes may carry over past the pregnancy so take care of urself now! Hubby said its really gross when people come in with diabetes, it slowly kills you and your skin dies he said the smell can be somewhat bad now majority of people who have it did do it to theselves for not taking care of themseles unfortunatly there is people who never asked for it!############I had to sign up in order to respond to this post. I am a certified diabetes educator. The information that diamondsz provided is not only dangerous, but can be construed as prejudice advice to all with diabetes. Everything that diamondz said is wrong. 1) having diabetes is ``not disgusting. '' people who think it is do not even know what diabetes means. 2) gestational diabetes usually goes away, but a person with gestational diabetes is at risk for developing it again in future pregnancies, or type 1 diabetes (we 'll get to that). 3) carbs are not bad at all. Everything you eat consists of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You can not avoid carbohydrates, and in fact, probably consume 60% of them. There are many, many kinds of carbohydrates. I would get into that, but it would take weeks of writing to tell you about it. 4) spoon fulls of sugar is bad, like she said, but it is bad for everyone. Being diabetic does n't mean it 's bad. If you ever, ever say, ``oh my god, that person is diabetic, they ca n't be eating that (insert desert item here)! '' , you need to stick your foot in your mouth. Especially if you ca n't even tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. All of the ``meal plan '' advice that has been provided by diamondz are just platitudes. It is impossible to do an armchair diagnosis of a person. Use this boards as support, not as medical advice. The fyi by diamondz is even more misleading. She claims that if you do n't take care of yourself now, then you 'll have diabetes later in life. This is not true. (we 'll get to that, too.) her ``hubby '' is wrong about diabetes, and it 's shameful that he be claimed to be an authority in this field. It 's all wrong, wrong, and wrong. Yes, uncontrolled diabetes leads to complications. Please note... Uncontrolled. This means different things to different types of diabetes. I wish diamondz did n't spread the common ``media belief '' of diabetes on this board. The following information is true: there are two major classifications of diabetes; type 1, and type 2. Of all the cases of diabetes in the world, between 5-10% of people in the world have type 1 diabetes; the remainder have type 2 diabetes. Of all the people who have type 2 in the world, there are over 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes. Four of the 6 kinds of type 2 diabetes are caused by lack of exercise, poor diet, and insulin resistance. This can sometimes be blamed on the person for not exercising or eating poorly-- in fact, most of the time, it is based on food. But some forms of type 2 diabetes are not the fault of the person. Hence, diamondz calling it ``gross '' is totally abusive in her ``authority. '' some people who have type 2 have gotten it because of cancer drugs (chemotherapy). So the next time you call a type 2 diabetic ``gross '', you 'd better have your facts straight-- they could be a five-time cancer survivor, and you 've just hurt their feelings for living. Type 2 diabetes can be controlled by diet, exercise, and sometimes oral medications called insulin sensitizers or incretin mimetics. Now, to the important type of diabetes-- type 1. Type 1 diabetes does not occur based on anyone's choice. It hits randomly. I said randomly. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction. Do you know anyone with ms? Lupus? Celiac disease? These are all autoimmune conditions. Type 1 diabetes can hit anyone-- at any time. It 's commonly called ``juvenile diabetes '' because it frequently occurs in younger people, but it can happen at any age. For every one-hundred diabetics that reads this message, five to ten of them have type 1 diabetes. Type 1 means their pancreas does not produce insulin, so it must be supplied through an insulin injection. So long as the person tests their blood glucose frequently, and adjusts for carbohydrate/fat/protein intake at meals, they can ``think like a pancreas '' and keep glucose values in normal ranges. This is not an easy job-- it is a full time job. This is a very complex subject, so i 've only touched the surface. There are basal insulins, bolus insulins, and a very complex world of diabetes management. If a person does not manage their blood glucose levels, they are more prone to diseases that affect small blood vessels (like retinopathy, kidney problems, neuropathy, and the list goes on). Please-- do not look at kids with type 1 and say they 're doomed. If they are in control of their diabetes, they live just as long. And with modern technology (e.G. Home blood glucose testing), complications of diabetes are reduced. Type 2 diabetes complications are of the same manner. These are the target populations that give type 1 diabetes a bad, bad name-- diamondz comments are evidence of this. I will respond to lalee's question in the following message.######Lalee, now to answer your question. Gestational diabetes is an interesting topic to me. It 's believed that in some women, insulin resistance causes the diabetic symptoms (it can be seen like type 2 diabetes), where in other cases, it models type 1 diabetes (where the mother's beta cells stop producing insulin in sufficient quantities). Home blood glucose meter kits have a +/ -20% error. This means that if you see 100mg/dl on the screen, it could be anywhere between 80 and 120 mg/dl. The purpose of the meter is tell a story of your trends. If you were showing 200 mg/dl on many occassions, this trend would be a flag about a problem. Showing 121 mg/dl does not mean you have diabetes... Even showing 140 mg/dl does not prove anything, because of the margin of error on the test kits. This fact should help to relax you a bit. Each of those tests costs$ 1.00, so it 's hard to experiment with the meter without costing a fortune. The average blood glucose level of humans, according to quest diagnostics statistics, is 85 mg/dl. This is a plasma level. This means that including post-meal, pre-meal, and fasting conditions, a person without diabetes averages, in their lifetime, 85 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia is when blood glucose levels fall below 60 mg/dl. Some people may experience it, and simply eating a meal (or candy) can raise blood glucose back up. You might feel shakey, confused, tired, annoyed, scared, and even sweaty during hypoglycemia. This is because stress hormones turn on in the body in an attempt to raise blood glucose-- this hormone is called glucagon. When a type 1 diabetic takes too much insulin, or does too much exercise, their blood glucose can drop-- hence their need to chomp on fast acting carbohydrates (such as dextrose). Hyperglycemia is defined as the condtion when glucose is higher than 180 mg/dl. If you give even the healthiest person in the world a bunch of candy, they will rise above 120 mg/dl. The person training you probably was reading the brochure and standard training literature. And they probably do n't know that a meter has a +/ -20% error rate. (i actually see the one-touch ultra, and if you read the small print documentation, you 'll see this is the fact). Make sure your meter code is set for the test strips you 're using-- this can skew your results a bit when it does n't match the test strip vial. 70 mg/dl is normal for waking up. The values you have presented show no signs of hyperglycemia (diabetes). If you are ever worried about having low blood glucose, just eat. Typically, you will find yourself at a low glucose level in the mornings, since you have n't eaten much. If you get up and wait 30 minutes before testing, you 'll discover that your body (specifically, your liver) releases glucose to raise you in order to help you ``hunt for food. '' you have nothing to be concerned about. I 'm going to give one more lesson for any other readers out there. Why are we concerned with gestational diabetes? Well, here's why. Insulin is a hormone that turns glucose (sugar) into fat. That 's it. Yes, very simple. People who lack insulin can not turn glucose into fat, so their bodies ``starve to death ''-- people with type 1 diabetes before 1921 (the invention year of insulin) would die, despite whatever they ate. Type 2 diabetes is defined as insulin resistance-- meaing that their body has plenty of insulin, but for some reason, is not able to use it (i could speak for hours on this topic.) you have beta cells in your pancreas that release insulin in response to high glucose values. (this is why a type 1 takes insulin when they eat, or when they need to lower their hyperglycemia into normal glycemia, which is in the range of 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl). I 'm leaving out a lot of details here... But basically, here 's the problem. If your blood glucose goes really high, the baby will produce insulin in order to lower the blood glucose in its body. You see, you share what is in your body with the baby's body. If your blood glucose is high, the baby's blood glucose will be high, too. So what does the baby do? The baby's pancreas produces insulin to compensate. This insulin, though, does not travel out to the mother's body. Instead, it works to lower glucose in the baby. Read back to what I said that insulin does. It builds fat. Here's why gestational diabetes is a bad thing: 1) the baby will come out weighing 10 + pounds... Not exactly a thing you want going through you, right? 2) high blood glucose increases the chance of bacteria to set up shop, because glucose is the essential food for all life, including bacteria; 3) having high glucose in the mom can cause oxidative stress, meaning, the mom will feel yucky; 4) having high glucose in mom can result in mom's beta cells working too hard-- if they work too hard, they will become damaged, and the mom could potentially be left with type 1 diabetes, which can occur anywhere from one day after birth to... You guessted it... A risk lasting the rest of her life. Some women have 3 kids, and end up with type 1 diabetes. Sorry for all the lessons, but I really saw a lot of information that was way out of line in this thread. Diabetes should not and does not have a negative image associated with it, as diamondz was presenting. You should never define a person with diabetes as beign a ``diabetic '' in a social situation; would you call a person with cancer something like a ``that peson with cancer '' or a person confined to a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis (ms) a ``multiple schleratic ''? I do n't think so. If you or anyone else has questions about diabetes, please feel free to contact me. Typos are the mistake of me writing this at 2 am. I hope this helps to lower your concerns. Also, I could go into the whole world of the glucose tollerance tests (gtt) that some of you have experienced, but I think this is more than enough information to digest for now. Btw, there are people who have ``hypoglycemia ''-- where they produce too much insulin, or become hypoglycemia after eating a high carbohydrate meal. (their body responds with insulin for the meal, but the insulin hangs around too long, causing cells to turn too much of that glucose into fat). Did you know that an average person has 6 grams of glucose in their blood? That 's why diabetes is so hard to manage... If you just add one extra gram of sugar in the body, it can raise glucose values by 40 mg/dl or even more (depending on weight). Okay, i 've said enough on this. I really hope diamondz takes back what she 's said about diabetes, and that she needs to have her husband, if he 's in the medical establishment, to stop telling her what he 's ``heard. '' by the way, a person's glucose can change by 300 mg/dlin as little as one hour. So do n't sweat the small changes. If you 're between 70 mg/dl and 100 mg/dl while fasting, you 're doing great. Two hour post-meal (also called post-prandial) should be under 120 mg/dl, though some scientists believe 140 mg/dl is just as fine, so long as fasting levels return to below 100 mg/dl. These values are played with all the time, but since your home test kit is only correct within 40% of the actual value (+20% to -20%), you ca n't freak out. Now if you keep getting results that are high, or after eating, then you can be concerned a bit more. If you have more diabetes questions, I highly recommend going to the american diabetes association website (www.Diabetes.Org) and go to the message board, and post questions in the appropriate forum. You will have very well grounded and experienced people there that can assist you with your questions.######Weird, my capitalizations on certain words has been modified... For example, quest diagnostics is the name of a business, and should be with a capital ``q '' and a capital ``d '', but when I saved the message, it was placed in lower-case format. Needless to say, the above messages I posted are not how I wrote them. This forum must modify cases to their own non-english standard. -- oh, and one more thing... Labs do n't necessarily test with a glucose meter. For the person who had blood drawn into a tube at each hour, this is because they are sending the blood in for accurate tests. Their glucose meters are the same as the ones you can buy off the shelf. That means they still have that +/ -20% error. The blood they put in a tube, however, will be sent to a lab, spun on a centrafuge, and testsed. The margin of error for lab-tested blood is typically less than 2% (that means a 4 mg/dl error range), which is much, much, much, much more accurate than a home glucose meter.######-Pregnancy Forum###-Pregnancy
