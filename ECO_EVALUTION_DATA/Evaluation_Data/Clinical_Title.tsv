With the advent and increased use of esophageal impedance monitoring, both acid and nonacid reflux disease can be better diagnosed and treated. Patients with severe symptoms or symptoms refractory to medical management may be offered anti-reflux surgery for optimal treatment. Though there are a handful of studies evaluating the efficacy of anti-reflux surgery on those patients with acid or non-acid related reflux disease, the comparison between acid and non-acid reflux disease following surgery is lacking. We propose a prospective study comparing clinical outcomes from those patients with acid versus non-acid reflux disease following anti-reflux surgery with the use of validated and disease specific quality of life surveys.

Other: Analysis of gastric juice Analysis of gastric juice including routine, biochemical and microbiological analysis. Other Name: Routine,biochemical, microbiological analysis Detailed Description: Functional dyspepsia (FD) and acid/bile reflux disease are common. These diseases share similar clinical manifestations. Individuals with functional dyspepsia (FD) often present upper abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, early satiety, loss of appetite, and no organic factors underlie it. Individuals suffering from acid/bile reflux disease often complain heartburn, upper abdominal burning or discomfort. What is more, there are always no specific changes on traditional endoscopy that can be used to differentiate these diseases (except erosive esophagitis). Though proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test is frequently applied to confirm the diagnosis of acid reflux disease, but certain amounts of individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not show favorable response to PPI test. In order to make a distinction of these diseases, esophageal pH-metry is needed, however it is not always available in most clinics. Recent data showed that new endoscopic technology such as Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging could demonstrate indistinct lesions caused by GERD which are not detectable by standard endoscopy, subsequently improve endoscopic diagnosis of these diseases. In addition, simultaneous analysis of gastric juice can help to determine whether bile reflux is present or not. As it is known, pathologic refluxes underlie not functional dyspepsia but acid/bile reflux disease. Hence, it is hypothesized that Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging in combination with simultaneous analysis of gastric juice could be used to differentiate functional dyspepsia from acid/bile reflux disease.   Eligibility 18 Years to 75 Years Genders Eligible for Study:

Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common cause of chronic cough and reflux of stomach contents into the airways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of respiratory diseases. Clinical history in patients with suspected reflux can aid in the diagnosis but traditional investigations for GOR including 24hr oesophageal pH monitoring or endoscopy are not reliable diagnostic tools since the reflux may be non acidic. The detection of pepsin in the sputum, saliva or bronchial biopsy has been found to be an accurate marker of reflux into the airways. Pepsin is solely produced by parietal cells in the stomach. The presence of pepsin in the upper airways therefore indicates reflux. Studies have demonstrated that pepsin was frequently found in laryngeal biopsies and sputum of patients with signs and symptoms of airways reflux and that Nissen fundoplication resulted in a decrease in pepsin detection alongside an improvement in symptoms. The Peptest™ lateral flow device has been shown to be effective in the detection of pepsin in sputum and saliva of patients with chronic cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux. The investigators have detected pepsin in expectorated saliva during episodes of cough, apparently supporting a diagnosis of airways reflux. Critics, however, have suggested that the act coughing itself is responsible for the reflux. This study aims to identify if cough induced by inhaled citric acid in healthy adult volunteers leads to detectable pepsin in expectorated saliva.

Verified March 2011 by National Taiwan University Hospital. Recruitment status was  Recruiting First received: March 8, 2011 Last updated: March 22, 2011 Last verified: March 2011 How to Read a Study Record   Purpose Reflux esophagitis is a common complication following distal gastrectomy. According to the investigators preliminary data, an Roux-en--Y gastrointestinal reconstruction in pancreaticoduodenectomy is associated with higher rates of reflux esophagitis. In this study, the investigators will investigate the incidence of reflux esophagitis after above procedure by the 24-h pH monitoring of esophagogastric junction. Procedure: Methods of gastrojejunostomy reconstruction Study Type: Effect of a Roux-en-Y Reconstruction on Reflux Esophagitis After Pancreaticoduodenectomy Resource links provided by NLM: Further study details as provided by National Taiwan University Hospital: Primary Outcome Measures: Incidence and severity of reflux esophagitis [ Time Frame: 3 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] Use panendiscopy to assess the reflux esopagitis Secondary Outcome Measures: Incidenc of marginal ulcer [ Time Frame: 3 months ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] Use endoscopy to assess the marginal ulcer Biospecimen Retention:   Samples With DNA esophageal mucosal biopsy for Real-Time PCR for COX-2 activity Estimated Enrollment: Patients with roux-en-Y reconstruction (study group) Procedure: Methods of gastrojejunostomy reconstruction Roux-en-Y reconstruction in pancreaticoduodenectomy Roux-en-Y anastomosis versus gastrojejunostomy only surgery, traditional gastrojejunostomy Traditional gastrojejunostomy reconstruction (control group). Detailed Description: Reflux esophagitis is a common complication following distal gastrectomy. Recently, an Roux-en--Y gastrointestinal reconstruction has been used increasingly to prevent reflux esophagitis; however, reflux esophagitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy (also including distal gastrectomy) has never been studied. In our preliminary retrospective study of 371 patients having PD (158 standard PD and 213 pylorus-preserving PD) at our hospital, after a median follow-up of 20 months (range, 2-110 months), 40 patients (10.8%) developed reflux esophagitis — 15 (9.5%) in the standard PD group, and 25 (11.7%) in the PPPD group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the only significant factors related to reflux esophagitis is Roux-en-Y gastrointestinal reconstruction independent of preservation of the pylorus. To our surprise, there is no significant difference in occurrence of GERD between patients after standard PD (15 of 158 patient) and PPPD (25 of 313 patients, P=0.49). We postulate reflux esophagitis following a PPPD in patients without past history of GERD is most likely caused by disruption of reflux-preventing systems at the gastroesophageal junction, thereby allowing reflux of gastric acid into esophagus. If the postulation is true, GERD after PPPD should be acidic in nature. To test this hypothesis we propose a prospective randomized study to compare preoperative and postoperative parameters, including esophageal morphology, bile acid concentration, trypsin activity of esophageal refluxate, COX2 mRNA expression of lower esophageal mucosa, and 24 hour pH monitor of lower esophagus. Moreover, to test the effect of a Roux-en-Y reconstruction to prevent GERD after PD, studied patients will be randomized into Roux-en-Y and control groups to study inter-group differences in incidence of GERD and marginal ulcer after PD. Acidic GERD should be treated with proton pump inhibitor. In contrast, alkaline GERD should be treated with pro-kinetic agent such as primperan and mopride. With this study, we can learn more about the nature of post-PD GERD following various gastrointestinal reconstructions and can give patient more personalized therapy.   Eligibility

It is defined as a gastrointestinal motility disorder that results from the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus or oral cavity, causing symptoms or complications .The prevalence of GERD is estimated to be between 20 and 30% of adults in western countries. Some studies have found a correlation between GERD and certain diseases of the airway and a proposed association to others. Both asthma and laryngitis can be caused by GERD. Pepsin has been discovered in the middle ear of children with middle ear effusion and GERD has been implicated in the pathophysiology of otitis media with effusion. The authors conclude that there may be a role of antireflux therapy in patients with otitis media with effusion. The relationship between reflux and snoring/obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been studied, and it is known that OSAS patients have a high incidence of nocturnal gatroesophageal reflux (nGER). The coexistence of reflux and various respiratory disorders can be used to argue that there is probably a correlation between reflux and CRS. Though some data indicate an association between GERD and upper airway inflammatory disease, this remains a matter of controversy in today's medicine. It is suggested that, if an upper or lower respiratory tract disorder is causally related to GERD, certain criteria should be met: An increased coexistence of both disorders should exist compared to the general population. A biologically plausible pathophysological mechanism should explain how GERD can cause CRS. clinical manifestations of the suspected GERD-related CRS should respond to anti-reflux therapy. There are Some theories for the relation between gastric reflux and CRS. The first one is the direct exposure of the nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa to gastric acid causing inflammation of the mucosa and impaired mucociliary clearance which could cause obstruction of sinus ostia and recurrent infections. It is known that pH variations affect ciliary motility and morphology in the respiratory mucosa.The second hypothesis is a relationship mediated by the vagus nerve; a mechanism already proven in the lower airway and in the nasal mucosa of patients with rhinitis but not in patients with CRS. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system can lead to reflex sinonasal swelling and inflammation, and consequent blockage of the ostia. Demonstrated that by infusing saline with hydrochloric acid in the lower esophagus of healthy volunteers, there was increased production of nasal mucus, increased score of nasal symptoms, and reduced peak nasal inspiratory flow.

Pediatric hypertension specialists lack an evidentiary base on which to establish definitive clinical practice guidelines for first-line therapy. Significant practice variation is an unsurprising consequence. Routine choice of the same first-line therapy for most patients with hypertension, absent testing other options, may delay correction of blood pressure for months or years. Failure to incorporate patient preferences in medical decision-making may also contribute to decreased patient satisfaction and adherence. Large parallel-group, comparative effectiveness trials are likely not on the horizon for this population. Moreover, heterogeneity of treatment effects would minimize the generalizability of such a trial to all patients. This is a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial to test whether the n-of-1 trial approach is superior to usual care in normalizing blood pressure while minimizing exposure to compliance-reducing side effects.

Specifically, there are two risk variants in the chromosome 22 APOL1 gene (G1/G2) and persons possessing 2 copies of these risk variants (G1/G1, G1/G2, or G2/G2), referred to as the high-risk (HR) genotype, are at high risk for non-diabetic kidney disease. Kopp et al. have shown that the APOL1 high-risk genotype confers sizeable odds ratios (OR) for FSGS (OR = 17), HIVAN (OR = 29 in the US; 89 in S. Africa), and hypertension-attributed end stage kidney disease (OR = 7). The presence of these risk variants is highest in West Africa, and specifically in Nigeria among persons of Hausa, Fulani, Igbo, and Asante descent. In the setting of untreated HIV infection, we have estimated that ~50% of individuals carrying the APOL1 HR genotype will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is limited availability of dialysis and kidney transplantation in Nigeria, and most individuals will die soon after developing ESKD. Markers of kidney disease include microalbuminuria, proteinuria, and/or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). All 3 have been associated with increased mortality in HIV+ adults. Increased urinary albumin excretion has diagnostic and prognostic value in the identification and confirmation of renal disease, and changes in albuminuria can be useful in assessing treatment efficacy as well as disease progression. Microalbuminuria, i.e., urine albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) in the 30-300 mg/g range, is likely the earliest stage of CKD, analogous to diabetic microalbuminuria. The renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is the central player in the pathophysiology of CKD and blocking RAAS with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is a well-recognized strategy to slow or halt renal disease progression in diabetics with CKD. To determine whether the presence of APOL1 HR genotype alters or predicts responsiveness to conventional therapy and if the addition of an ACEi to standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk for renal complications among West African adults, we will screen 2,200 HIV+ ART-experienced adults; to conduct the following Specific Aims: To determine the prevalence of APOL1 renal risk variants and assess whether APOL1 HR status correlates with prevalent albuminuria, eGFR, and/or prevalent CKD in a West African population. To assess whether RAAS inhibition (with the ACEi lisinopril) in addition to ART, compared to the existing standard-of-care (SOC), will significantly reduce the incidence of additional kidney disease manifestations. We will randomize ART-experienced (6+ months) adults with prevalent microalbuminuria (uACR 30-300 mg/g) and an eGFR of > 30 ml/min/1.73m2 to lisinopril (n=100) vs. SOC (n=100); and To determine whether the APOL1 HR genotype is associated with worse longitudinal renal outcomes in Nigerians with prevalent albuminuria.   Eligibility 18 Years to 70 Years   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

Recruitment status was  Recruiting First received: October 27, 2010 Last updated: October 27, 2010 Last verified: October 2010 How to Read a Study Record   Purpose Numerous clinical and experimental data show that the elective treatment of diabetic nephropathy should be based on drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Albuminuria is a marker of risk not only renal but also cardiovascular and diabetic patients with concomitant non-diabetic nephropathy, on the other hand, drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system available so far, namely ACE inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists II have proven effective in reducing proteinuria in power even if different therapeutic drug to drug. ACE inhibitors are one of the most known and used treatment options for blocking the renin-angiotensin system in patients with microalbuminuria. Drugs such as enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril are standard therapy in diabetic patients with micro or macroalbuminuria. However, it is still unclear whether their efficacy is, from this point of view, the same or varies from drug to drug. This is particularly true in the diabetic microalbuminuria, a condition in which there is sufficient documentation to prove that ramipril is effective. The main objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and trend of the time and to the antiproteinuric effect of antihypertensive 10-20mg/die imidapril versus ramipril 5-10 mg / day in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.

Methods Design: This will be a multi-center randomized prospective trial. Patients with Crohn's ileitis or Crohn's ileocolitis requiring initial resection will be randomized to undergo either the Kono-S anastomosis or the side-to-side functional end anastomosis. Patients will be randomized into two Groups: Group 1: Kono-S anastomosis vs. Group 2: side-to-side functional end anastomosis. The purpose of this study is to compare the post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease between Kono-S procedure and the side-to-side functional end anastomosis. In any intestine surgery, after the sick portion of the bowel is removed, the intestinal tract is restored by reconnecting the healthy ends together. The new connecting line is called anastomosis, and could be created in a variety ways by the surgeon. This study will compare two different intestinal connections called Kono-S anastomosis and the traditional side-to-side functional end anastomosis. Initial studies have demonstrated that the Kono-S anastomosis has prevented endoscopic evidence of the post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease at greater rates than the traditional side-to-side functional end anastomosis. There is no evidence which of these commonly-used treatments is better because more information is needed. The purpose of this study is to find this by doing this study. Follow up: Patients will be discharged on no prophylactic treatments and they will be followed post- operatively at 3to 6 and 12 months with a colonoscopy to assess for endoscopic recurrence. The mucosa will be graded with the Rutgeerts score for post-operative recurrence. All colonoscopies are part of the standard treatment. All patients will have also standard 30 days follow up. Follow up Care: Patients with a Rutgeerts score at 3 months of: 0, 1 or 2a will be followed prospectively without introducing medical treatment. above >2a will initiate medical therapy for Crohn's disease should the patient's symptoms warrant colonoscopic evaluation earlier than three months; this will be done at the gastroenterologist's discretion. This is a standard of care Colonoscopic images (movie preferable, still color photos acceptable) will be shown to a gastroenterologist blinded to the goal of the study for determination of the Rutgeerts score. The patients will then undergo a subsequent colonoscopy at one year from surgery for reassessment of the anastomosis. Harvey Bradshaw Index as a marker of clinical disease activity will be used. This will be recorded before procedure (baseline), 3to 6 and 12 months post procedure.   Eligibility 18 Years to 90 Years   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

It is defined as a gastrointestinal motility disorder that results from the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus or oral cavity, causing symptoms or complications .The prevalence of GERD is estimated to be between 20 and 30% of adults in western countries. Some studies have found a correlation between GERD and certain diseases of the airway and a proposed association to others. Both asthma and laryngitis can be caused by GERD. Pepsin has been discovered in the middle ear of children with middle ear effusion and GERD has been implicated in the pathophysiology of otitis media with effusion. The authors conclude that there may be a role of antireflux therapy in patients with otitis media with effusion. The relationship between reflux and snoring/obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been studied, and it is known that OSAS patients have a high incidence of nocturnal gatroesophageal reflux (nGER). The coexistence of reflux and various respiratory disorders can be used to argue that there is probably a correlation between reflux and CRS. Though some data indicate an association between GERD and upper airway inflammatory disease, this remains a matter of controversy in today's medicine. It is suggested that, if an upper or lower respiratory tract disorder is causally related to GERD, certain criteria should be met: An increased coexistence of both disorders should exist compared to the general population. A biologically plausible pathophysological mechanism should explain how GERD can cause CRS. clinical manifestations of the suspected GERD-related CRS should respond to anti-reflux therapy. There are Some theories for the relation between gastric reflux and CRS. The first one is the direct exposure of the nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa to gastric acid causing inflammation of the mucosa and impaired mucociliary clearance which could cause obstruction of sinus ostia and recurrent infections. It is known that pH variations affect ciliary motility and morphology in the respiratory mucosa.The second hypothesis is a relationship mediated by the vagus nerve; a mechanism already proven in the lower airway and in the nasal mucosa of patients with rhinitis but not in patients with CRS. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system can lead to reflex sinonasal swelling and inflammation, and consequent blockage of the ostia. Demonstrated that by infusing saline with hydrochloric acid in the lower esophagus of healthy volunteers, there was increased production of nasal mucus, increased score of nasal symptoms, and reduced peak nasal inspiratory flow.

Information provided by (Responsible Party): Medical University of Warsaw How to Read a Study Record   Purpose The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in non-smoking adults with chronic cough and the prevalence of BHR in patients with upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), to evaluate the relationship between BHR and cough reflex sensitivity, to assess the diagnostic accuracy of methacholine challenge test (MCT) in cough variant asthma (CVA) with special regard to its discriminating cut off value between CVA and other causes of chronic cough, particularly GERD, to estimate prognostic value of BHR, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and induced sputum eosinophil count in predicting response to asthma treatment. Patients diagnosed with a chronic cough will undergo the standard diagnostic work-up recommended by experts for patients with a chronic cough, including methacholine challenge test (MCT) and an at least 4-week period of causal treatment. Patients with BHR in MCT will be treated with - in first step B2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for at least 4 weeks, if improvement is not significant in next steps with leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or systemic corticosteroid. A good treatment response, evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and cough challenge will confirm the diagnosis of the disease. A statistical analysis will consist of the frequency of BHR in a chronic cough, correlation between the results of MCT and cough reflex sensitivity in capsaicin inhalation test and cut-off point for MCT to discriminate asthma from other causes of a chronic cough.

After obtaining an informed consent, the diagnostic approach of the most common causes of chronic cough will be performed: a medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph, in some cases chest computed tomography, pulmonary function tests (spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, methacholine challenge test), laboratory tests (total immunoglobulin E concentration, complete blood count), skin prick tests, induced sputum cell count, computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses and ENT consultation, 24-hour impedance with pH monitoring, videolaryngoscopy and cough challenge with capsaicin. The cough severity will be assessed twice (on admission and after six weeks of causal treatment) using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Polish version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and the capsaicin inhalation cough challenge. If MCT result is positive, CVA will be assumed the cause of a chronic cough and treatment with an inhaled steroid combined with a long-acting beta-agonist will be administered for at least 4 weeks. If no satisfactory response to this treatment is observed, an anti-leukotriene agent or in the next step systemic corticosteroid will be applied. Ineffective treatment with the above-mentioned medications will indicate an opportunity for a different underlying cause of BHR. The estimation the area under a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve will be used to determine the optimal cut-off point for the differentiation between asthma and alternate causes of a chronic cough. It is expected to assess the frequency of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in subjects with a chronic cough, to confirm a correlation between the results of MCT and the sensitivity of cough reflex measured in capsaicin inhalation cough challenge. The investigation will probably determine a precise cut-off point for MCT which would allow discriminating asthma from other causes of a chronic cough.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Other Name: Dexlansoprazole Experimental: Guided therapy group Participants will be give Dexlansoprazole 30 mg daily for GERD, 60 mg daily for GERD with erosive esophagitis for 8 weeks and Theophylline SR 250 mg daily for functional chest pain for 4 weeks. Drug: Guided therapy group Receive Dexlansoprazole 30 mg daily for GERD, 60 mg daily for GERD with erosive esophagitis for 8 weeks and Theophylline SR 250 mg daily for functional chest pain for 4 weeks. Other Name: Dexlansoprazole and/or Theophylline SR Detailed Description: Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is very common in the general population but symptom alone or patient's characteristics do not adequately differentiate cardiac and esophageal cause. Cardiologists are usually consulted first to exclude life-threatening acute coronary syndrome. Tests that are performed to exclude ischemic heart disease include exercise stress test and the more invasive coronary angiography. A negative stress test or angiogram or the presence of mild blockage of a single vessel disease will usually be adequate to exclude significant ischemia as a cause for chest pain. The next most important cause of unexplained chest pain would be gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD and its complications of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma have increased markedly in recent decades, not just in the developed countries but also in Asia. Although relatively less common among populations in Malaysia, there are data to suggest an increasing prevalence of reflux disease largely a result of obesity and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Dexlansoprazole (Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Japan) is a novel dual delayed release system recently approved by the FDA for treatment of heartburn associated with non-erosive and erosive reflux disease. It is unknown if dexlansoprazole is effective as an empirical therapy for NCCP. Another approach would be therapy guided by investigations including high resolution (HR) esophageal impedance manometry and 24-hour pH-impedance studies. Study of esophageal function has greatly evolved with the recent availability of high resolution multi-channel solid state manometer and impedance. Water swallows are commonly used in esophageal manometric studies to evaluate for peristaltic abnormalities. Esophageal pH monitoring does not detect all gastroesophageal reflux (GER) events but with the combination of impedance, this technique allows detection of GER of gas and acid or non-acid liquids. These tests would enable diagnosis of GERD and functional chest pain and thereby allow targeted therapy. For treatment of GERD, dexlansoprazole is effective and for functional chest pain, nonspecific adenosine antagonist, theophylline is proven to improve symptoms in patient with hypersensitive esophagus. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is also effective for functional chest pain , however it is not known if theophylline is more effective than any other SSRIs.It is unknown about the response rates based on the guided therapy approach compared to the empirical PPI therapy. Therefore, the aim of the intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness of empirical therapy vs. guided therapy on symptoms unexplained non-cardiac chest pain.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03511521 First Posted : April 27, 2018 Last Update Posted : April 27, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Northwestern University Study Description Go to  Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Glucocorticoids are known to cause an increase in insulin resistance, leading to hyperglycemia, in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. In both the inpatient and outpatient setting, steroids are used for their anti-inflammatory property to treat a variety of conditions. There is a paucity of information regarding the best way to treat steroid-induced hyperglycemia. In this study we will compare (1) the addition of NPH insulin, an intermediate-acting insulin, given at the time of steroid administration to the patient's standard basal/bolus insulin to (2) modification of the standard basal-bolus insulin regimen which will consist primarily increasing the prandial doses at lunch and supper in order to determine which regimen is superior for glycemic control. Condition or disease Hyperglycemia Steroid-induced Insulin Resistance, Diabetes Drug: NPH Insulin Drug: glargine Drug: Insulin Aspart Phase 4 Detailed Description: Inpatients who will receive single daily doses of prednisone or methylprednisolone for treatment of their underlying condition and who become hyperglycemic will be eligible. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of two arms: (1) to their standard basal bolus insulin the addition of NPH insulin given at the time of the steroid adminstration, adjusting the dose based on the dose of steroid; (2) an increase in the basal and prandial bolus insulin doses based on the dose of steroid. Glycemic control and the incidence of hypoglycemia will be assessed over the first 3 days after initiating these insulin regimens. Study Design Go to  Parallel Assignment Intervention Model Description: Patients receiving single dose steroids who become hyperglycemic will be randomized to two treatment arms in a parallel design: (1) NPH added to basal/bolus insulin; (2) increase in doses of basal and bolus insulin Masking: Use of Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) Versus Basal Bolus Insulin for Steroid Induced Hyperglycemia Actual Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Intervention/treatment Experimental: NPH Insulin NPH will be given at the time of steroid administration to the patient in addition to standard basal/bolus insulin the patient may be receiving in the following doses: Prednisone Dose (mg/day) - NPH dose (Units): 10-20 mg/day - 1.2U (units)/mg; 21-40 mg/day - 0.6U/mg; 41-60 mg/day - 0.45U/mg; 61-80 mg/day - 0.3U/mg; >80 mg/day - no additional NPH. Note that the amounts of NPH are added to each other for the various prednisone doses. For example, a dose of 75 mg/day of prednisone would come out to be (1.2U x 20mg = 24U) + (0.6U x 20mg = 12U) + (0.45U x 20mg = 9U) + 0.3U x 15 mg = 4.5U) for a total of 24 + 12 + 9 + 4.5 = 49.5U of NPH for 75 mg of prednisone.

Bariatric surgery can effectively and long-term reduce excess body weight and relieve related metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are commonly used in bariatric surgery. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy due to simple operation, good weight loss, and metabolic disease control effect, which is more widely used. However, there are several studies that show an increased chance of gastroesophageal reflux disease after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Long-term gastroesophageal reflux may lead to Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer. Nowadays, the cause of gastroesophageal reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy is not clear and precautionary measures are not precise. In this study, prospective randomized controlled trials were conducted to explore the possible causes of gastroesophageal reflux after sleeve gastrectomy and to explore ways to prevent gastroesophageal reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy. Condition or disease Phase Gastroesophageal Reflux Bariatric Surgery Procedure: 2 cm away from the pylorus edge Procedure: 4 cm away from the pylorus edge Procedure: 6 cm away from the pylorus edge Procedure: LRYGB Not Applicable Detailed Description: With the social development and changes in the lifestyle, the incidence of obesity and type 2diabetes is rapidly increasing. In 2010, the global incidence of type 2 diabetes was 8.3% in adults, 11.6% in China and 50.1% in China. In overweight and obese people, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes also increased significantly, and the prevalence of type 2diabetes in those people with BMI> 30 reached 18.5-23%. Diabetes-induced cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, renal insufficiency and other complications, seriously affecting the quality of life of the patients, endangering the safety of life, the treatment of type 2 diabetes and related complications to public health expenditure has brought tremendous pressure. Traditional medical methods are difficult to achieve long-term and effective control of type 2 diabetes. Surgery has been shown to achieve 75-95% long-term relief of obesity in patients. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, RYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are most commonly used. Among them, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is relatively simple, low incidence of complications, lower operating costs, and gradually become the most important surgical methods of weight loss and metabolic disease surgery. Numerous clinical studies are shown that sleeve gastrectomy in patients with type 2 diabetes has the same therapeutic effect as gastric bypass with a complete remission rate of 70-90% for T2DM. For the choice of surgical approach, numerous studies have shown that BMI ≧ 45, the general choice of gastric bypass surgery, BMI <45, participants can choose sleeve gastrectomy. The remission rate for T2DM, sleeve gastrectomy has a good result for young patients with shorter duration. In China, the BMI less than 45 is majorities. According to the previous survey in 2012, the newly diagnosed diabetes patients in China constituted more than half of all diabetic patients. Since laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is relatively simple, so sleeve gastrectomy is easier to popularize in China and has wide application prospect. As an invasive treatment, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy also presents opportunities of surgery-related complications, including gastric leak (0.5-1%), stenosis (0.1-0.5%), bleeding (about 0.5%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a most common upper gastrointestinal disease, numerous clinical studies shown that the incidence of GERD in western populations are 10-20%, while obese people are around 37-72%, if abdominal fat accumulation more obvious, the incidence of GERD will become higher. In China, there is still no relevant data. Gastric bypass surgery has a clear effect on the treatment of GERD, and the relationship between sleeve gastrectomy and GERD is still controversial. Some studies have shown that sleeve gastrectomy did not increase the incidence of postoperative GERD, while another study showed that the incidence of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy increased significantly. In addition, no studies have revealed the reasons for the occurrence of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy and no study showed how to prevent the occurrence of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy.

Nevertheless, little is known about the success of this intervention or about the relation of some ultrasound measures with the outcome. Manual Rotation of A Liveborn Procedure: Manual rotation Time Perspective: Prospective Official Title: Relation of Ultrasound Parameters Associated to Labor Progression and Manual Rotation's Success in Persistent Occiput Posterior Position Further study details as provided by Ana Catarina Reis de Carvalho, University of Lisbon: Primary Outcome Measures: Success of manual rotation of the fetal occiput in OP in 2nd stage of labour [ Time Frame: This outcome will be measure immediately after the attempt of manual rotation ] After the attempt of manual rotation we will confirm if the fetal occiput, initially in Occiput-posterior (OP) position, is now in Occiput-anterior position (successful rotation) or if is still in OP position (unsuccessful rotation). This confirmation will be made through ultrasound observation. Secondary Outcome Measures: Impact of ultrasound measures (progression angle (PA) and dorsal fetal position) [ Time Frame: The PA and dorsal fetal position will be measure after the diagnose of full dilatation when occurs the first urge to push or 30 minutes after the diagnose of full dilatation (multiparous) or 60 minutes after the diagnose of full dilatation (nulliparous) ] The relation of PA and dorsal fetal position accessed by ultrasound and the success of manual rotation; Estimated Enrollment: February 27, 2018 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure) Intervention Details: Procedure: Manual rotation Rotation of the fetal head to an anterior position at time of fuel dilation that is part of routine care Detailed Description: Persistent OP at delivery occurs in approximately 10% of fetuses and studies have shown an increase in short-term and long-term maternal and fetal complications such as prolonged labour, maternal exhaustion, fetal distress, instrumental delivery, caesarean delivery and severe perineal tears. Manual rotation of the fetal occiput to OA position has been described as a safe and effective intervention in the setting of labour arrest but evidence is limited. Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate: 1. The success of manual rotation of the fetal occiput in OP in 2nd stage of labour; The relation of progression angle (PA) accessed by ultrasound and the success of manual rotation; This is as prospective study with a sample size calculated of 50 participants. º Identify an OP position during digital examination in the first evaluation at full cervical dilatation (t=0) º Get informed consent from the pregnant woman. º Wait for the first urge to push or T=30 m (multiparous) or T=60 (nulliparous) º Confirm fetal head position by ultrasound and measure PA. º Attempt a manual rotation to anterior position accordingly to the protocol. º Confirm fetal head position by ultrasound.   Eligibility 17 Years and older   (Child, Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

It is able to ""sniff"" smells and separate different smells by their electronic ""signature"". Studies using an electronic nose strongly suggest that smelling samples taken from humans (e.g. urine/ stool/ sweat/ tears) can identify different electronic smell signature from people with different diseases and in the future might be a new and easier way to diagnose serious conditions at an earlier stage. In a very small study, it has been successfully shown that using an electronic nose to sniff a stool sample does seem to identify people before they have had any radiotherapy - who will go on to get serious bowel side effects of radiotherapy. If this finding is correct, this is very important as it would allow the cancer doctors the option to change the way they give radiotherapy if they knew that a person was at very high risk of serious side effects from the treatment and to start treatment for the side effects at a much earlier stage. In this study the investigators want to confirm in a larger study whether the previous findings are correct, and to see whether similar results can be obtained by sniffing urine rather than stool (that would be much easier for everyone) and identify exactly which part of the complicated ""smell"" signature is different in the people who will get side effects. This may lead for the investigators to able to identify why people are making this specific smell and then do something about changing the smell before treatment starts. The likeliest cause for the production of a smell which predisposes to side effects is a specific group of germs living in the bowel. If these germs can be identified, then there are many possible ways of changing these germ populations in advance of radiotherapy. Enormous improvements have been made in treating cancer in recent years leading to hugely improved survival, however, treatment not infrequently can lead to side effects. Of all the possible long term physical side effects of cancer treatment, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are the most common and can have a great impact on daily activity. It is becoming increasingly clear that development of side effects in the bowel is not just related to the dose and way the radiotherapy is delivered."

Not Applicable Detailed Description: In this study, the investigators expect about 30% of the PCOS patients enrolled to be resistant to Myo-inositol treatment for ovulation induction, probably due to the presence of malabsorption caused by gut dysbiosis. The most recent evidence proposes dysbiosis and related chronic low-grade inflammation as the new DOGMA behind PCOS pathogenesis. In this regard, the recent findings on alpha-lactalbumin reports its effect in improving the absorption of different nutrients including myo-inositol as well as a crucial factor for reducing inflammation. Furthermore, this whey protein is well known for its effect as trophic agent for gastrointestinal flora in infants. For all these reasons, the investigators expect that the treatment with Inofolic HP (Myo-inositol and alpha-lactalbumin) will get an efficacy 20-25% higher than the treatment with inofolic.

The study will be conducted at the Royal Victoria Hospital, McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) Solid Organ Transplant Unit, which carries out 60 liver transplants per year. A dedicated liver transplant database is in place since 1990 and prospectively collects demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients. In November 2013, two fully equipped Fibroscan machines have been acquired by the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology of the MUHC. The MUHC is the first center in Quebec to have access to the latest modules of Fibroscan (CAP and XL probe) that are essential to diagnose hepatic steatosis. In preparation for the current project, the Investigators performed an analysis of frequencies of hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, NASH, hepatitis B as indications for liver transplantation MUHC Center Solid Organ Transplant in 2000 and 2013. NASH was the only indication that significantly increased (8% in 2000 vs 20% in 2013; p<0.0001) and currently represents the third indication. Enrolled participants will be followed every 3 months for one year, in conjunction with their regular care visit. Blood samples obtained during the screening and the study visits will be processed by the research technician of the MUHC Solid Organ Transplant Unit. The plasma will be stored at -80C until used for quantitative measurement of CK-18 levels by the Human cytokeratin ELISA kit. The fibroscan examination will be performed on a 4-hour fasting participants. The standard M probe will be used in all participants. The XL probe will be used in obese patients (BMI>30 Kg/m2) and in case of failure of Fibroscan by the M probe. CAP examination will be performed at the same time to diagnose hepatic steatosis. A valid Fibroscan result will be defined by 10 validated measures and IQR < 30% of the median. Validated cut-off values will be applied to diagnose hepatic steatosis and fibrosis by Fibroscan/CAP. Grading of steatosis will be as following: mild steatosis (<30% of the hepatocytes); moderate steatosis (30-60%); severe steatosis (>60%).   Eligibility 18 Years and older   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

It is very similar to other diseases that cause fever, like malaria and yellow fever. People get Lassa fever from mice infected with Lassa virus. It can also be spread from body fluids of people with the disease. Researchers want to learn more about this virus in Mali so they can develop better tools to diagnose and prevent it. Objective: To find out how many people in certain areas of southern Mali have ever had Lassa fever and count how many people get the disease every year. Eligibility: People ages 6 months to 99 years who live in certain areas of Mali Design: Women who are could become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test at each visit. Participants will be asked questions about their age, if they have ever had a fever, and if they have ever seen mice in or around their home. This will take about 20 minutes. Participants will give a blood sample using a needle in a vein in the arm. Young children will give it by pricking a finger or heel with a needle. Patients with a fever illness will have a medical history and physical exam. They will give blood and nasal swabs 3 times over 21 days. Participants may be asked to come back 1 time each year for up to 3 more years to take another sample of blood and answer more questions. Condition or disease Lassa Virus Infection Detailed Description: In West Africa, as many as 300,000 people are infected annually with Lassa virus (LASV),resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths. Most commonly, human infection comes from contact with infected rodent hosts (Mastomys natalensis), or ingestion or inhalation of virus-laden particles. Person-to-person transmission is also well documented and can cause outbreaks, especially in nosocomial settings. Infection in pregnancy, especially the third trimester, is particularly severe, with maternal mortality rates estimated at 20% and fetal mortality rates nearing 100%. A survey of rodents captured in the village of Soromba (rural commune of Sibirila, district of Bougouni, Mali) found that 25% of M. natalensis had evidence of LASV infection. A 2015 study of LASV infection in the human populations of this region showed seroprevalence of 33.2% and annual incidence rate of 6.3% in 2016. The purpose of this serosurvey study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of human exposure to LASV in the administrative districts of Bougouni, Yanfolila, and Kolondi(SqrRoot)(Copyright)ba in southern Mali. The study involves 2 separate sub-studies. Study 1 is a cross-sectional serosurvey of residents of the general population selected from a census. The study will follow up to 500 participants at each of 4 study sites. Participants will be asked to give blood samples at baseline and annually for 3 years. Study 2 is a clinic-based serosurvey conducted at local health centers following up to 500 participants per year at each of the 4 study sites. Patients who report with febrile illness suggestive of Lassa fever will be asked to give blood and nasal swab samples, then return for follow-up visits 5 and 21 days later for clinical consultation and additional blood and swab collection. All participants will be provided with free medical treatment according to local standard of care as needed for the duration of the study. They will be followed passively between study visits and instructed to report to their local health center if they have a fever. Individual participation for both studies will last through a common end date, up to 4 years. Blood and nasal swab samples will be used to identify history of or current LASV infection and for exploratory studies into the biochemistry and pathophysiology of LASV infection. Elucidating the prevalence of LASV infection in the populations of southern Mali may help Malian authorities improve surveillance, and additional research may help develop diagnostics and treatment.

Increased levels of these two enzymes (amylase and lipase) are associated with acute inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis). In humans treated with GLP-1 (receptor agonist) there have not been found an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Animal and cell studies have shown that the increased levels of amylase and lipase in the blood are not due to an inflammatory state but adaptive changes (volume increase) of the pancreas. The investigators (professor Jens Juul Holst, professor Sten Madsbad) want to investigate whether the increased levels of amylase and lipase in the blood of individuals treated with the GLP-1 analogue Saxenda are due adaptive changes of the pancreas. This will be achieved by measuring amylase and lipase before, during and after treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and at the same time use advanced scanning equipment (PET-MR) from the Clinical Physiological and Nuclear Medical Department at Rigshospitalet, which can determine any volumetric changes in the pancreas with high reproducibility. The scan will be centered on the pancreas, other organs are not evaluated why the study is not designed to detect any malignant findings in the pancreas or other organs. Condition or disease

Most of the guidelines related to the details of management of acute pancreatitis are extrapolated from the adult literature. There is only limited data regarding management of acute pancreatitis in children. The mainstay of management is bowel and pancreatic rest with significant fluid support to minimize the effect of the cytokines on the pancreas and other organs. The standard fluid choices are Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) and normal saline (NS). Currently, both LR and NS are used at the discretion of the treating physician as the standard of care for acute pancreatitis. The investigators hope to examine the question of ideal fluid choice for fluid resuscitation in children with acute pancreatitis by assessing recovery time in the context of measured inflammatory markers and SIRS status at 24 and 48 hours after admission. The ideal fluid choice in the initial resuscitation of acute pancreatitis has not been effectively evaluated before in the pediatric population. Even if there is no statistically significant difference between the two fluid options, this trial will still provide clinically significant information.

Condition or disease Drug: Clinical treatment Detailed Description: Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by the sudden onset of abdominal pain, elevated serum amylase, and edema or necrosis of the pancreas. The clinical course of AP is generally mild; however, nearly 25% of patients progress into severe AP which consists of organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis. Although advances in the diagnosis and management have been made, AP remains a major health issue to the society. PNec is a major complication of AP which manifests as non-opacified parenchyma with intravenous contrast, as identified via contrast-enhanced CT scan. Patients with PNec are more likely to develop pancreatic infection and suffer a greater risk for mortality . Currently, CECT scans remain the ""gold standard"" to diagnosis PNec clinically. However, the extent of PNec is best seen about 3 days after the presentation of disease and may be missed in early CT scan. In addition, repeated CT scanning is not convenient to monitor changes in necrosis, most notably for those who are receiving mechanical ventilation or hemofiltration.The clinical diagnosis of AP is based on the presence of the following features: abdominal pain; serum amylase and/or lipase levels three times higher than the upper limit of normal; and characteristic findings of AP on CT scan. Specific plasma biomarkers in predicting pancreatic necrosis (PNec) are needed in treating acute pancreatitis (AP). Aims To investigate the prognostic value of plasma mitochondrial DNA fragments (mtDNA) in patient with AP for PNec. Methods AP patients with symptoms onset within 72 h were prospectively enrolled.The conclusions elevated plasma mtDNA content in AP patients may be used as a more accurate early predictor of PNec in contrast to traditional CRP. Normally,human mtDNA is strictly contained in mitochondria and not exposed to the innate immune system even following cell apoptosis. However, in times of cell death elicited by stress (e.g., trauma and sepsis), mtDNA is released into systemic circulation and leads to an array of inflammatory reactions. Elevated mtDNA levels have been reported in a variety of clinical situations, including trauma, severe sepsis, and cancer. As PNec is caused by intracellular activation of digestive enzymes and autodigestion, we assumed that circulating mtDNA levels could be used as a biomarker for early detection of PNec. Research methods and steps:cell culture and mtDNA extraction、mtDNA detection、statistical analysis、results. Study Design Go to  Layout table for study information Study Type :"

Lipase is a valid target for anti-obesity products as shown by the pharmaceutical drug orlistat which targets the same enzyme. Reducing the amount of lipase activity will reduce the amount of triacylglycerol (TAG) that will be digested and therefore absorbed and will be seen as a reduction in the level of circulating TAG in the blood. Adding alginate to a range of food products that are simple to include into the diet could help with the management of obesity. In this study, sausages containing alginate have been manufactured for us along with matched control sausage. The circulating TAG in the blood will be measured via fingerpick blood samples every 30 minutes for four hours after the volunteers have eaten either alginate sausages or normal sausages. The volunteers will come for two visits and consume the other sausage meal at the second so they will have had both types of sausage. Study Design Go to

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03396354 First Posted : January 10, 2018 Last Update Posted : January 10, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Yonsei University Study Description Go to  Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Despite the theoretical superiority of robotic technology, surgical outcomes following robotic surgery have shown little benefit over conventional laparoscopic surgery. At present, studies have evaluated the value of robotic technology in clinical practice, including EndoWrist®, TilePro®, Firefly®, and Single-Site®, and have demonstrated the possibility of added clinical value, specifically in regards to decreased postoperative pancreatic fistula, usefulness as a multi-display education system, visualization of lymphatic channels, and implementation of reduced-port robotic gastrectomy. However, these technologies have only been applied independently and not in a well-organized manner. Maximizing radicality and safety while minimizing invasiveness are critical to bettering cancer surgery. We hypothesize that robot technology can affect these factors positively and that the use of appropriate parameters thereof could help shed more light on the benefits of a robotic system in gastric cancer surgery. Radicality: added benefit of Firefly® for lymph node visualization Number of retrieved lymph nodes can be considered a surrogate marker of long-term survival. In our proposed study, we will focus on the number of retrieved (lymph nodes as the primary outcome. Additionally, bleeding, which is known to be associated with poor overall survival, will be measured as a secondary outcome. Three-year recurrence free survival and 5-year overall survival will be followed up. Safety: benefit of Firefly® in differentiating lymph nodes from other organs and benefit of a magnified view and EndoWrist® Although robotic surgery reportedly shows less in-hospital and outpatient complication rates, a higher number of enrolled patients is needed to statistically validate these results. In the currently proposed study, these would be secondary outcomes. We have experienced the benefit of using fluorescence imaging to differentiate lymph node from biliary trees and pancreas parenchyma. As a reflection thereof, bleeding would be measured as parameter of unintended injury to a normal organ. To evaluate injury to pancreas parenchyma and postoperative pancreatic fistula, amylase/lipase levels in serum and drainage fluid will be measured. Invasiveness: value of Single-Site® Serum CRP (C reactive protein) levels (day 0, day 3, day 5, and 4 weeks after surgery) and pain scores (at 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr after surgery) will be measured to evaluate surgical trauma to the patients.

The increase in prescription and inadequate use of this class of medication calls for studies on the effects of prolonged PPI therapy on renal function.

These patients have persistent heartburn and/or regurgitation despite double dose proton pump inhibitor. Patients are referred for esophageal high resolution impedance manometry and ambulatory 24-h pH-impedance monitoring on proton pump inhibitor. Other: Correlating the number of reflux episodes detected on 1-h post prandial esophageal high resolution manometry combined and those detected on ambulatory 24-h pH-impedance monitoring performed on PPI Esophageal high resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) consists of introducing a transnasal probe to record esophageal contractility (manometry), bolus transit (impedance) but also the occurrence of reflux episodes. Ambulatory 24-h pH-impedance monitoring consists of recording the occurrence of reflux episodes by introducing a transnasal catheter into the esophagus. After inserting the transnasal HRIM probe and the pH-impedance catheter, both HRIM and 24-h pH-impedance recordings are started. The patient is instructed to eat a meal that induces reflux symptoms (the patient brings his own meal). One hour the end of the meal, the HRIM probe is removed. The patient is discharged at home and the 24-h pH-impedance monitoring is continued. The patient is coming back 24-h after catheter insertion to stop the pH-impedance recording and remove the catheter.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

The fact is that multi medication in old patient increase the iatrogenic risk and decrease the medication compliance. The Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)are overused in this patient category.Several studies suggest the existence of a rebound effect when people were treated more than 8 weeks ; this effect seems to appear around 14 days after with hyperacidity symptoms. But there are no studies about old patient. So in this context the aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of rebound effect occurence after the end of PPI 8 weeks treatment.

Detailed Description: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the top 5 most widely used drugs in the world. PPIs suppress the formation of gastric acid through the inhibition of hydrogen-potassium-adenosine-triphosphatase (H+ / K+ -ATPase) - a known proton pump in the parietal cells of the stomach. In practice, PPIs are commonly prescribed to treat GI disorders such as peptic ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux. They are also used prophylactically to prevent stress ulcers and to reduce GI toxicity associated with certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and steroids, sometimes despite a paucity of evidence. PPI use has been associated with increased risk of enteric infections. A meta-analysis of 23 studies, comprising almost 300.000 patients, showed a 65% increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea among patients who used PPIs. Another meta-analysis of 11.280 patients, from six studies evaluating Salmonella, Campylobacter and other enteric infections, also found an increased risk due to acid suppression, with a greater association with PPI than with H2-receptor antagonists. Moreover, long term PPI use has been shown to be associated with bowel symptoms: A study from 2011 reported incidences of bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain and diarrhoea (43%, 17%, 7% and 2% of selected cases, respectively). In addition, PPIs are known to cause malabsorption of Vitamin B12 which may ultimately lead to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Very recently, PPI use was associated with an increase in mortality. The gut microbiome plays an important role in enteric infections and bowel symptoms. The composition of the gut microbiome can inhibit or promote the microbial colonisation of the gut by microbial pathogens. Several mechanisms can influence bacterial growth or the immune system. Long term PPI use is associated with profound changes in the gut microbiome. It is believed that these conditions are caused through the long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion (and thus shifting intragastric pH) which alters the natural habitat of resident microbiota. Furthermore, increased gastric pH might not sufficiently protect against oral or food-borne pathogens. We recently conducted a study at the Medical University of Graz where we could show that patients with long-term PPI therapy have dysbiosis associated with intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability, bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation associated with a higher risk of complications and mortality in liver cirrhosis. (A. Horvath et al., Long-term proton pump inhibitor use increases intestinal dysbiosis, gut permeability, inflammation and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis, UEG Journal, accepted) Probiotics are live microorganisms that have been demonstrated to alter gut flora and exhibit positive effects on numerous gastrointestinal complaints, strengthen the gut barrier and reduce inflammation parameters We hypothesize that a three months probiotic intervention with OMNi BiOTiC PPI improves PPI induced dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation and gut permeability in patients on long term PPI therapy, leading to a decrease in bacterial translocation and a better gastrointestinal quality of life.   Eligibility 18 Years and older   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

Dexlansoprazole is a new, dual delayed release formulation of PPI that increases the mean intragastric pH during a 24-hour period. The prospective, open-label, randomized study aims to compare the efficacy of two different PPI formula in treating patients with atypical GERD symptoms. Patients with atypical GERD symptoms and a total Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score ≥13 (cough, globus, and NCCP) will be invited to participate. Personal characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, and the severity of erosive esophagitis will be recorded. After enrollment, 120 subjects will randomly assign (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive either oral lansoprazole, Takepron OD 30 mg, once daily before breakfast or oral dexilansoprazole, Dexilant 60 mg, once daily before breakfast for 8 weeks. Subjects will record their symptoms (cough, globus, NCCP, heart burn, and acid regurgitation) at daytime and nighttime everyday via diary for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint is to compare the cumulated incidence of each symptom free during 8-week therapy period between the two study groups. The secondary endpoint will be the withdrawal or drop-out rate due to poor symptoms response or drug adverse effects. Data will be analyzed with SPSS Statistical Software for descriptive statistics (percentage, mean, standard error, and 95% confidence interval) and analytical statistics (chi-square test, ANOVA, and generalized estimation equation; GEE).

In preparation for hemodialysis, they will have an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) procedure which provides access to the veins for dialysis. This study is testing a device called the Fist Assist to dilate the vein in preparation for dialysis. The device is similar to a blood pressure cuff (worn around the arm and applies pressure). All study participants will wear the Fist Assist twice a day up to three months before their AVF procedure. Device: Fist Assist The Fist Assist device works by applying pressure to the subject's arm in the area where their arteriovenous fistula will eventually be created. The device is mobile and battery powered. The Fist Assist device will be assigned to each enrolled subject by randomization code. All subjects will be asked to use their assigned device twice daily, for two 2-hour sessions, once in the morning and once in the evening. Patients will apply the device to the non-dominant arm above the level of the elbow, and to keep a written log to record use, complications and any problems. They will be asked to do this for 3 months, and will come in to be evaluated via study visits at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Vein diameter [ Time Frame: 3 months ] The primary outcome will be the difference in the vein diameter measured in millimeters with use of a vascular ultrasound device before and after Fist Assist use. The standard deviation of the change in vein diameter will be approximately 0.75mm. Secondary Outcome Measures : AVF creation [ Time Frame: 12 months ] Whether or not an arteriovenous fistula was created, as defined by a procedure performed by surgery or interventional radiology connecting an artery to a vein. AVF maturation [ Time Frame: 12 months ] Whether the resultant AVF matured, as defined successful cannulation with two needles for three hemodialysis treatments. Subsequent exposure to central venous catheters [ Time Frame: 12 months ] The subject's subsequent exposure of patients to central venous catheters during their first year for hemodialysis as measured in total number days of central venous catheter access used for hemodialysis.

Patients will be required to put on a pair of hand gloves with 18 IMUs located on specific bony landmarks (distal phalanges of fingers, proximal phalanges of index fingers and thumbs, dorsum of the hands and bilateral wrists). Device: Myelopathy Hand Patients will undergo radiological and clinical examination at the Duchess of Kent Children Hospital. Patients will be required to put on a pair of hand gloves with 18 IMUs located on specific bony landmarks (distal phalanges of fingers, proximal phalanges of index fingers and thumbs, dorsum of the hands and bilateral wrists) Detailed Description: Cervical myelopathy is a common condition due to degeneration of the cervical spine causing stenosis and cord compression, with a higher prevalence in Asian population. It leads to decreased hand dexterity and function, sensory loss, gait and sphincter disturbance. Natural history shows a stepwise deterioration in most cases, whilst a slow progressive deterioration or sudden deterioration is observed in small number of subjects. The myelopathy hand was first described by Ono et al. on the analysis of finger motion impairment caused by cervical myelopathy. They described a 10 second grip and release test, which documents the number of times a subject can make a fist and release it as rapidly as possible within 10 seconds. The clumsiness associated with intrinsic finger weakness decreases the number of cycles a patient can perform during the test. They quantified patients' neurologic deficit and found that &lt;20 grip -release cycles in 10 seconds represented symptomatic myelopathy. The presence of this sign is not only pathognomonic of cervical myelopathy but also correlates with disease severity. This is a sensitive and specific sign of pyramidal tract involvement and has since become a classical sign and objective test of the condition. The presence of myelopathic hand signs aids the diagnosis of symptomatic cervical myelopathy and its grading acts a guide to the severity of the condition to the treating surgeon. However, this quantitative analysis only provides a crude representation of the clumsiness that patients experience from their deterioration of hand function. In the original description, Ono et al. noted the quality of this movement was affected particularly in advanced cases, where there was difficult, slow and incomplete finger extension, exaggerated wrist flexion with attempted finger extension and exaggerated wrist extension with finger flexion. This was considered to be caused by a failure of synergy between the wrist and the fingers. Finger motion is complex, varies greatly and clinical evaluation is often difficult. Apart from the counting the number of cycles a patient can perform, the classical grip and release test contains other critical clinical information that has been widely described by surgeons but in very vague terms that are neither reproducible nor meaningful in clinical practice. Although this uncoordinated finger motion and inability to move their fingers smoothly in grip and release cycles are well-known phenomena in myelopathy patients, they have been only vaguely recognized. Presently these kinematic characteristics have not been quantified or studied, and it is not known which types of myelopathy present with them, how it correlates with disease severity and its prognosticating value.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Weight loss occurs in pancreatic cancer patients and is common in a multitude of other cancers. Patients with metastatic cancer and weight loss sometimes are not able to receive treatment due to physical weakness or debility. Disulfiram is a potential inhibitor of muscle degradation and may reduce tumor induced muscle wasting. Disulfiram may also help gemcitabine hydrochloride work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet know whether giving gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without disulfiram is a better treatment for unresectable solid tumors or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Frail older adults tend to have many health problems that require treatment, but are also at risk of harm from the medications prescribed. This makes it hard to get older adults the treatments they need and keep them safe from the harms from medications. It ends up that a lot of visits to emergency rooms and hospitals are due to medications, especially for older adults. Previous research has shown the benefits of stopping medications older adults no longer need. Even so, healthcare professionals do not always do this as well as they could. Our goal is to make a collection of resources for pharmacists who work with doctors and nurses in primary settings that will help support older adults as they safely stop medications that are no longer needed. The investigators will use knowledge and tools that are already known and published. In the first six months the team, which includes older adults and their families, pharmacists, doctors, nurses, and healthcare policymakers developed a framework and resource toolbox that pharmacists can use to help older adults stop medications that are no longer needed. In the remaining 10 months, the investigators will use the resource toolbox in primary healthcare teams and nursing homes. Overall, the investigators expect that by using the resources the pharmacists will be able to support patients stop medications they no longer need and help reduce the number of pills people take, reduce drug costs, reduce harms from medication use and improve quality of life for frail older adults and their loved ones. Condition or disease Inappropriate Prescribing Primary Health Care Polypharmacy Other: Deprescribing toolbox and intervention Not Applicable Detailed Description: As frailty and medical comorbidity increases, the number of medications used increases. The resultant polypharmacy is intended to improve the health status; however, large observational studies refute this premise. In fact, polypharmacy (more than 3 medications) is associated with increased hospitalization (OR 3.79, 95% CI {1.33, 10.90}) and increased mortality (OR 1.27, 95% CI {1.04, 1.56}). With increasing polypharmacy, the risk of adverse health outcomes increases so it is important that deprescribing initiatives are promoted to reduce medication use to improve patient outcomes. Numerous tools exist that can be used to identify Potentially Inappropriate Medications (PIM), including; Beer's list, STOPP/START, PRISCUS, LAROCHE, Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI), Drug Burden Index, Anticholinergic Drug Scale, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale, and numerous deprescribing tools from the Canadian Deprescribing Network. The implementation of these tools is not as high as it could or should be, as evidenced by polypharmacy data, such as the 2011 study that found 30% of Canadian seniors aged 65 to 79 took at least five prescription medications concurrently. It is likely that medication use is greater among the oldest old. The literature is replete with evidence and tools to identify the medications that are the most likely to cause adverse events, however this information is not being translated into practice as medication use and PIM use persists in older adults. Deprescribing is the process of withdrawal of an inappropriate medication supervised by a healthcare professional with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes. Healthcare practitioners self-identify that deprescribing is a challenging process. Primary care physicians have increasingly complex patient loads, which contributes to increased numbers of specialist involvement. This makes it challenging to know which medications are necessary and which can be discontinued and whose responsibility it is to initiate and monitor the deprescribing process. In Nova Scotia media has brought attention to PIM use with our high rates of benzodiazepine use. Recent publications have also identified high use of antipsychotics in Nova Scotia. Previous work suggests including a pharmacist or nurse in deprescribing helps with its success. Indeed, prior work suggests that culture change, and integrated primary care can make a small difference in polypharmacy, but that more targeted interventions with specific engagement of pharmacists is needed. Pharmacists have extensive training in medication use, effects, safety and toxicity. They can identify and resolve medication related issues. Pharmacists can carry out treatment plans in a collaborative environment working with prescribers to monitor medication adherence, effect, and toxicity. Meta-analysis has identified 13 pharmacist led interventions to reduce polypharmacy, which included nine in primary care and two in nursing homes. Society has a need for improved uptake of deprescribing to support appropriate drug use by adults. The tools and resources available have not led to widespread uptake/implementation. To date deprescribing remains one of the many demands on primary care providers (Family Physicians/Nurse Practitioners). The investigators consider the skill set of pharmacists as ideal to support and monitor patients as they move through the deprescribing process. The investigators recognize that deprescribing cannot happen without extensive communication with primary care providers so that all members of the healthcare team are aware and engaged with the patient and their deprescribing. In considering this collaborative practice clinics with pharmacists embedded in the practice have been identified as sites where pharmacist led deprescribing can successfully support patients through the deprescribing process. This pharmacist led deprescribing process will conform to the standard of care using an evidence supported framework for a selected number of drugs and using recognized deprescribing algorithms and guidelines.

By identifying a partial set of phonemes (units of speech) from this CI feedback, a new language could be developed. Condition or disease Deafness; Sound Perception; Quality of Sound Other: Cognate Speech Synthesizer sound percepts Detailed Description: A cochlear implant (CI) is a small, complex electronic device used by the profoundly deaf or severely hard-of-hearing. The CI has two main components: 1. The externally worn microphone, sound processor and transmitter system; 2. The implanted receiver and electrode system sending electrical currents to the inner ear; whereby the external and internal components are held together by a magnet. The CI does not restore normal hearing; however, it does provide a small representation of sounds in the environment and help him or her to understand speech. Due to the limited capacity of the CI, hearing is vastly different from normal hearing and it is difficult to really understand what they are hearing; hence, the varying outcomes of CI users. Most of the current research on cochlear implants (CI) aims to improve speech recognition for spoken English. However, patients who have a cochlear implant late in life—basically after childhood—have a very limited ability to learn speech. Late implant CI recipients do not distinguish speech sounds well, but it is not known if non-speech sounds can be differentiated, and if so, whether they can be used to create a functional language. Honeder et al studied the latest CI to determine the impact of a new audio processor on speech perception in noise. Overall, this new CI may improve hearing performance especially in difficult listening situations; however, due to inconsistencies in technical setups, speech processors, coding strategies, spatial conditions, spectral and temporal noise characteristics, speech testing paradigms, and subjects' ear they were unable to find significant improvements. Thus, demonstrating the challenge of understanding truly, what CI users hear and understand. Usher Syndrome is the most common inherited condition where children are born with moderate to profound hearing loss, depending on the type affecting. Usher syndrome affects approximately 4 to 17 per 100,000 people, and accounts for about 50 percent of all hereditary deaf-blindness cases. Usher's syndrome affects three to six percent of all children who are deaf and who are hard-of-hearing. Of the three types, types 1 and 2 are the most common and make up about 95% of the reported cases. Since genetic factors are the most commonly known etiology for Usher's Syndrome, it is very difficult to know what exactly the effected patient might hear or understand while using a CI. A systematic review by Nishio et al showed relatively good CI outcomes; however, there have only been limited studies conducted on patients with other gene mutations. Overall, CI patients report improvements in speech and quality of life. Unfortunately, the exact mechanisms of how and what Usher Syndrome CI users' process still requires further investigation. Despite the historical usage and various advancements in computer technology for CIs, the hearing world has yet to implement underutilized methodology and technology to further train, assess, and advance the capabilities of CIs. More importantly, simulation hearing labs providing a standardized, patient controlled environment with high-fidelity tracking and monitoring hearing simulations using a keyboard synthesizer (Cognate) attached to an external CI will allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the CI users' hearing experience, assimilation, interpretation, and user controlled actions. Cognate is a simplified and more structured speech synthesizer. The synthesizer will generate the CI output, an acoustic output, and a visual display of the acoustic signals and CI output on the monitor and record the outputs of the synthesizer. Cognate would be an alternate 'English' encoding CI system that might be simpler to learn, and would translate written English, not spoken English. Cognate would translate text into percepts (sounds) that the subject would 'hear'. These percepts (sounds) would be equivalent in a sense to phonemes (letters). With a partial set of phonemes (English uses 45 for very computer sounding speech synthesis), a new language could be developed. The feasibility and data from this study will be used for future studies to evolve the Cognate encoding CI system, especially for Usher Syndrome patients. Study Design Go to

Experimental: Intervention group An individualized home-based caregiver-training program for managing behavioral problems, with referrals to community services and telephone consultation, further assurance and consultation were provided in monthly telephone follow-ups, and progress in behavior management was evaluated. Other: A home-based caregiver-training program This training program consisted of two weekly sessions, each lasting 2 to 3 hours. Following the training sessions, further assurance and consultation were provided in monthly telephone follow-ups, and progress in behavior management was evaluated. Detailed Description: The illness course and symptoms of dementia is usually very long and characterized with behavioral, psychological and physical changes. Family caregivers' stresses change during the illness trajectory as well. Thus, the needs of the elderly persons with dementia and their family caregivers differ in different stage of dementia, and the services they require are multidimensional. According to the researchers' previous 2-year study, behavioral problem management and service utilization were found to be the most difficult and least prepared caregiving activities and the family caregiver's needs for assistance of these two caregiving activities differed in different stage of dementia.The purpose of this study is to compare the costs and effectiveness of two care models- home-based caregiver-training program model and routine care model for dementia elders in Taiwan.   Eligibility

The burden of dementia is rising in China, with major medical, social and economic impacts. To address this important public health problem, cohort study on elderly cognitive disorders should be carry out. The methods of early prevention, early diagnosis and early treatment the cognitive disorders in elderly should be found to reduce the burden of the social and economic issue due to dementia. At present, the international corresponding guidelines have taken gene and brain imaging biomarkers as important indicators of dementia pathogenesis research, accurate diagnosis and targeted intervention. Based on the above understanding, the study carry out the population cohort study based on accurate diagnosis and construct the high standard information and sample bank. The study will establish the standard and quality system of geriatric cognitive disorders cohort study (unified standards and norms). The study will integrate the standard biological samples stratified acquisition function module (homogeneity and precision) of elderly cognitive disorders, and complete the construction of biological samples bank and clinical diagnosis and treatment information database. The study will apply and develop brain structural and pathological imaging technology to support precision diagnosis of senile cognitive disorders.

Behavioral disturbances are a major source of caregiver burden and an important contributor to the decision to admit AD patients to institutionalized long-term care. Among the innovative approaches, rocking chair therapy has been introduced as a potential means for reducing agitation in elderly with dementia. Only few studies evaluated the effect of this therapy on the behavioral symptoms in elderly with cognitive impairment. The results were promising, but not sufficiently significant. We propose to perform this study having as a main goal to evaluate the effect of the rocking chair therapy in agitation for home care residents with dementia. The secondary aim of the study will be the evaluation of psychoactive drugs use as well as pain killers. Cohen Mansfield agitation inventory will be employed for the pre- and post-therapy evaluation. Included subjects will be installed in groups of five, rocking chairs will be placed away from other residents in a semicircle in a corner of the dayroom. The therapy sessions will be held every afternoon, for two hours, under the supervision of the unit psychologist and a master's degree psychology student. During the daily session, each resident should be encouraged to actively rock to reach the goal of 60 minutes of rocking accumulated per day. The total duration of the therapy period will be 6 weeks. The use of pharmacological restraint (neuroleptics, anxiolytics) and pain killers will be evaluated before, during and after the six weeks therapy. The expected outcome is a reduction of agitation among elderly with dementia, as well as a reduction in the use of pharmacological restraint and pain killers. Condition or disease

It has been estimated that 36 million people have dementia worldwide, and in older people Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-70% of all dementia. Research supports the hypothesis that modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with cognitive decline, which opens new avenues for prevention or modification of disease. The concept that inspires this proposal 'Ageing-Gut-Brain Interactions study' is that the gut microbiota impact upon the gut-brain axis and thereby on behaviour, including challenging behaviours often associated with dementia. In the absence of available cures for Alzheimer's disease, diet is an important modifiable component but knowledge about the role of diet in clinical symptoms of dementia is currently very limited. A recent study from Ireland from the European Union funded Nu-Age cohort reported that the gut microbiota profile in the elderly was different between community-living and institutionalized individuals, with specific microbiome profiles correlating with frailty and poor health. Changes in dietary composition and diversity were considered the main drivers of the shifts in gut bacteria profile. In this multi-disciplinary research study, the investigators will assess the gut microbiota composition in people with Alzheimer's dementia with and without challenging behaviours, test the feasibility of recruitment, and provide initial data to support a future grant application involving a dietary intervention study in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The investigators will test the hypothesis that the gut-brain axis promotes behavioural changes in Alzheimer's dementia and is responsive to changes in gut microbiota profile, by comparing the gut microbiota profile between three participant groups (1) Alzheimer's dementia with challenging behaviour, (2) Alzheimer's dementia without challenging behaviour, and (3) a control group of healthy age-matched elderly. The investigators will also carry out a survey of care homes to assess their willingness to participate in a future dietary supplementation study. Condition or disease Detailed Description: Introduction Healthy life expectancy is a key area of research. It has been estimated that 36 million people have dementia worldwide and that there are 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year. Epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis that modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with cognitive decline, opening new avenues for prevention. Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia in older people, accounting for 60-70% of all dementia cases when using traditional diagnostic criteria for dementia subtypes. There are no available cures for AD, but an alternative approach is to use strategies that delay disease progression at an early stage. Optimal brain function results from highly complex interactions between numerous genetic and environmental factors, including food intake, physical activity, age and stress. Diet in particular has become the object of intense research in relation to cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiota is a large, diverse collection of microbes, collectively containing 100 times more genes than the host. It is host-specific, contains heritable components, can be modified by diet, surgery or antibiotics, and in its absence nearly all aspects of host physiology are affected. We now realise that the human microbiota is a previously overlooked system that makes a significant contribution to human biology and development.There is a new and exciting field of research with limited published data in the elderly, that could provide a basis for the design of novel, microbiota-targeted, therapies to improve care of older people who suffer from Alzheimer's dementia. There is increasing evidence that identifies the gut microbiota as a key conduit between nutrition and brain function. Reduction in the frequency of genes encoding short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was prominent among institutionalized older adults, as were increases in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins-6 and -8, and C-reactive protein. Rationale for Study Hypothesis: The composition and/or diversity of the gut microbiota is different between healthy elderly and those with Alzheimer's dementia, who do or do not exhibit behaviour(s) that are challenging. The concept that inspires Ageing-GB is that our gut microbiota impact upon the gut-brain axis and thereby on behaviour. There is a need to understand the nature of that impact, the underlying mechanisms, and how changes in diet can reprogram our gut microbiota-brain axis to resolve or reduce clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer's dementia. However, to the investigator's knowledge, there has been no published work to examine the gut microbiota profile in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, the investigators first need to demonstrate the differences in microbiota profile between AD patients with or without behaviours that are more challenging to manage. This work is anticipated to provide fundamental evidence to support dietary modification or supplementation as cost-effective and safe avenues for alleviating signs and symptoms of dementia in this vulnerable group and thus reduce the carer burden. This study will require the co-operation of care home managers and staff, and investigators will thus simultaneously assess the feasibility of performing a nutritional intervention study in this group of individuals, in this setting.

In Korea, the prevalence of dementia among elderly people aged 65 and over was 9.18% in 2012, and the number of patients with dementia was estimated to be 540,755 (155,955 for male, 384,800 for female). The number of patients with dementia will be doubled every 20 years until 2050, which is estimated to be 840,000 in 2020, about 1.27 million in 2030, and 2.71 million in 2050. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 55-70% of all dementia. Major risk factors include age, genetic factors, apolipoprotein E gene, female and brain trauma, but stress is also associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Stress can be present anywhere in our daily lives, and stress can energize life, but if people are exposed to stress for a long time, they may develop physical symptoms. Severe and long-term stress can cause or exacerbate diseases such as angina, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, tension headache, back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma and arthritis. Studies about the relationship between stress and Alzheimer's disease have shown that the corticotrophin releasing factor secreted when exposed to stress can increase brain toxic protein such as beta amyloid plaques that are known to be responsible for dementia. There are various ways to overcome stress, like meditation, yoga and relaxation training methods that individuals can do at home. Relaxation training methods include relaxation using breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation therapy stabilizes anxious psychology by stretching and relaxing several muscles of the body in turn. Muscle relaxation promotes arterial and venous flow, lymphatic flow, reduces edema of muscles and connective tissues, and improves organ function to aid homeostasis. Muscle relaxation has been reported to be effective in alleviating anxiety and agitation symptoms in patients with dementia, but no studies have examined the effects of muscle relaxation therapy on cognitive function changes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare and validate the improvement of cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment over the age of 50 years and patients with early Alzheimer's dementia after performing muscle relaxation machine massage regularly.

The investigators will also monitor the appearance of adverse effects during and post intervention, with a follow up at 3 and 6 months. Condition or disease Brachial Plexus Neuropathies Brachial Plexus Birth Palsy Device: Armeo Spring Pediatric Other: Conventional physical and occupational therapy Phase 4 Detailed Description: Obstetric brachial plexus injury is caused by damage of the cervical nerve roots C5-T1 during delivery. It has traditionally been treated with occupational and physical therapy during the first few months, evaluating at 1, 3 and 6 months if primary surgery is required. The goal of primary surgery is to repair the damaged nerve roots and restore neural function. Despite surgery, a large percentage of children will remain with varying degrees of paralysis. Since Narakas I (""Erb's"") paralysis is the most common, motor sequelae usually involve limited shoulder abduction, restricted shoulder external rotation and elbow flexion contracture. This sequelae requires ongoing physical and occupational therapy, especially during school age, to ensure adequate upper extremity function and participation. Armeo Spring Pediatric is a robotic tool that enables upper extremity training using virtual reality. Virtual reality is usually well tolerated and highly motivating to school age children. Since it's a relatively new tool, its effectiveness in the treatment of obstetric brachial plexus injury has not been documented. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Armeo Spring Pediatric training as compared to conventional therapy (occupational and physical therapy), in improving the upper extremity function of children with Narakas I (C5-C6) obstetric brachial plexus injury. It will study two parallel groups of children ages 5-8. Both groups will receive 45 minute sessions, 3 times a week, for a total of 5 weeks (15 sessions). One group will train upper extremity function using Armeo Spring Pediatric and the other group will receive occupational and physical therapy, as detailed in protocol. They will be reevaluated at 3 and 6 months. The appearance of adverse events, such as pain, fatigue or muscle contracture, will be documented during intervention, post intervention, and at 3 and 6 months. In the presence of one such adverse event, the training session will be suspended and the patient evaluated by physiatrist or orthopedic surgeon, with treatment if necessary. If the symptoms resolve before the next session, the patient will complete training as planned. If the symptoms are not resolved by the next session, the patient will be removed from the clinical trial until recovery. Study Design Go to  Effectiveness of Armeo Spring Pediatric in Children With Narakas I Obstetric Brachial Plexus Injury Estimated Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Intervention/treatment Experimental: Armeo Spring Pediatric This group will receive training with Armeo Spring Pediatric in 45 minute sessions, 3 times a week, for a total of 15 sessions Device: Armeo Spring Pediatric Before intervention, the robotic device will be adjusted to the user's unique dimensions to avoid injury. Each 45 minute session will include active upper extremity shoulder abduction, shoulder external rotation and/or elbow extension exercises, led by virtual reality game and supported by robotic arm. Sessions will take place 3 times a week for a total of 15 sessions. Active Comparator: Conventional physical and occupational therapy This group will receive combined physical and occupational therapy in 45 minute sessions, 3 times a week, for a total of 15 sessions. Other: Conventional physical and occupational therapy Conventional therapy will combine physical and occupational therapy, including the following activities: Upper extremity weight bearing exercises. Approximation techniques on wrist, elbow and shoulder. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation: shoulder flection, adduction and external rotation and shoulder flection, abduction and external rotation. Scapulothoracic joint mobilization. Stretching of shoulder abductors and external rotators. Hand/wrist facilitation exercises (with ball). This will be carried out in 45 minute sessions, 3 times a week, for a total of 15 sessions. Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Change in Modified Mallet Scale [ Time Frame: 0 weeks, 5 weeks, 17 weeks, 29 weeks ] It measures arm function in 7 different positions: arm at rest, shoulder external rotation, shoulder abduction, hand to neck, hand to mouth, hand to back and supination. Each position can be given a subscore from 1 (very altered) to 5 (almost normal), with a total score of 35. A higher score means better function (closer to normal movement or position). In this case, the investigators will evaluate change in Modified Mallet Scale between baseline (0 weeks), post treatment (5 weeks) and follow up (17 and 29 weeks). It will take into account changes in total scores and subscores in different positions. Secondary Outcome Measures : Upper extremity passive range of movement [ Time Frame: 0 weeks, 5 weeks, 17 weeks and 29 weeks ] Will be measured by goniometry Adverse events: pain. [ Time Frame: 5 weeks, 17 weeks and 29 weeks ] Will be measured by Visual Analogue Scale. The visual analogue scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The investigator will then measure in millimeters the distance from left to right (0-100 mm) to quantify the amount of pain. A low score means less intense pain and a high score means more severe pain. The Visual Analogue Scale uses many formats (straight line, boxes, happy/sad faces). Because of the age of the study population in this clinical trial, the investigators have decided to use the happy/sad faces scale. At 5, 17 and 29 weeks, the patient will be asked to document the pain they feel at that moment, not during the treatment. Adverse events: fatigue [ Time Frame: 5 weeks, 17 weeks and 29 weeks ] Will be measured by Borg Scale The Borg Scale is an instrument that quantifies the exertion perceived by the patient with a score from 0-10, as follows: 0 = at rest; 1 = very easy, 2 = somewhat easy, 3 = moderate; 4 = somewhat hard, 5-6 = hard; 7-8 = really, really hard; 8-9 = really, really, really hard; 10 = maximal effort. At 5 weeks, the patient will be asked to document the fatigue they felt during the treatment. At 17 and 29 weeks, they will be asked to document the fatigue they feel at that moment. Adverse events: muscle contracture [ Time Frame: 5 weeks, 17 weeks and 29 weeks ] Will only be recorded if present/absent, since there is no scale to measure it Eligibility Criteria Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

On days with and without frequent interruptions, signs of fatigue and the activity pattern of the trapeze muscle are registered and compared using electromyographic registrations of the trapezius muscle. Condition or disease Muscle Fatigue Trapezius Muscle Strain Behavioral: interruptions of work tasks Not Applicable Detailed Description: 30 healthy adults without chronic neck pain participated in a laboratory study designed to simulate two full workdays of computer work. Within each session, participants performed five 50-min working activities separated by 10-min breaks: i) Use a computer keyboard to type a text presented on the left side of the screen; ii) do the typing task with the desk height set10 cm above elbow height; iii) play the computer game Spider Solitaire implemented in Windows 10; iv) Stroop test (This test consists of reading the name of a color whose text is in a color different from the name. The color name was then selected from a multiple-choice panel displaying color names; v) the same online puzzle game was presented to all participants. Assembling the puzzle was performed by drag and drop actions. The work periods were not disrupted (on the ""control day"") whereas two short interruptions of 5-min were introduced at 1/3 and 2/3 of each working period on the ""intervention day"". During these interruptions, participants were asked to perform ""muscle disrupting/relaxing"" activities. For each experimental session a 30-min lunch break took place between the third and the fourth work periods. The specific sequence of work activity type and disrupting/relaxing activities was randomized across participants; however, for each participant the order of work activities remained the same for the two experimental sessions (control and intervention days). The order of control and intervention days was also randomized between participants. A set of six measures were performed at specific time intervals during each experiment: before the first work activity, before and after lunch, immediately and 1 hour after the fifth (last) work activity: i) upper trapezius activation, assessed through the temporal EMG profile recorded by a single bipolar signal; and ii) through the spatio-temporal distribution of EMG activity detected by a 2D array of electrodes (64 channels); iii) muscle fatigue, quantified by changes in electrically induced muscle twitch force signals, iv) isometric performance, v) dynamic performance; iii) cognitive and physical load and stress level. In addition, personality traits (anxiety level), perceived workload and musculoskeletal symptoms were evaluated as covariates.

Sponsor: First received: January 7, 2011 Last updated: January 21, 2011 Last verified: January 2011 How to Read a Study Record   Purpose The overall objective of this study is to provide ongoing assessment of the safety and effectiveness of seasonal and pandemic H1N1 vaccines in the prevention of ILI (influenza like illness), ILI-associated work absenteeism, and laboratory-confirmed influenza in a cohort of Canadian HCP (Health care providers). Given the uncertainties around the timing of the provision of seasonal influenza immunization to HCP for the 2009/10 influenza season, this study will focus on evaluation of safety and effectiveness of pandemic influenza immunization in Year 1 and evaluation of all recommended influenza vaccines in Years 2 and 3. Monitoring Seasonal and Pandemic Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness in Healthcare Providers:A Prospective Cohort Study Resource links provided by NLM: Further study details as provided by Dalhousie University: Primary Outcome Measures: Assessment of the safety and tolerability of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine among a cohort of HCP [ Time Frame: October to April each year ] [ Designated as safety issue: Yes ] Health care providers will receive automated email reminders with a link to report any changes in their health within 4 weeks of vaccination. Secondary Outcome Measures: To validate published ILI case definitions in a cohort of HCP [ Time Frame: October to April each year ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] A cohort of HCP will be asked via an automated email to report the presence of an upper respiratory illness and to self collect a nasal swab to be tested for influenza. Estimated Enrollment: April 2012 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure) Detailed Description: Participants in Year 1 (2009/10) will be recruited beginning Oct. 1 through the end of the pandemic H1N1 influenza immunization campaign. Participants will be followed from the day of vaccination until the end of the influenza season approximately Oct-April for each season. At the initial visit, participants will have 1 tube of blood (10cc) collected at the time of enrolment to determine baseline antibody titres against pandemic H1N1 and the influenza strains in the past and current year's seasonal influenza vaccines. Participants will receive automated email reminders with links to follow-up web-based questionnaires at weekly intervals following the completion of the baseline survey and until the end of the influenza season. If a participant reports a respiratory illness, they will receive a follow-up questionnaire asking details of the illness including the occurrence of respiratory illness and associated symptoms, contact with patients or household members that had respiratory illness, respiratory symptom-related healthcare utilization, prescription or over-the-counter products used for treatment of the respiratory illness, and number of days of work missed due to respiratory illness or worked with symptomatic respiratory tract infection. An email will be sent to each participant every Monday morning during the season reminding the participant to complete their weekly diary and report and send in their nasal swab if they have symptoms of an acute respiratory illness. At the initial visit participants will be taught how to collect their nasal swab and will practice doing their own swab in the presence of the study nurse/research associate. Participants will be instructed to collect a nasal swab and return the swabs as soon as possible after onset of ILI or respiratory illness (target < 48h after onset). Participants will be asked to collect the swab if they develop symptoms compatible with a viral respiratory tract infection (fever without an apparent source OR new symptoms with at least 2 of the following -cough, runny/stuffy nose, sneezing, sore/scratchy throat, hoarseness, malaise, myalgia, headache, fatigue OR one local symptom (runny/stuffy nose, sneezing, sore/scratchy throat, hoarseness, cough) plus one systemic symptom (fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, fatigue). If they prefer, a nasopharyngeal swab will be collected by a member of the study team as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms.   Eligibility 18 Years to 69 Years Genders Eligible for Study:

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03385889 Recruitment Status : Not yet recruiting First Posted : December 29, 2017 Last Update Posted : December 29, 2017 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Aaron Hartstein, Shenandoah University Study Description Go to  Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: The effects of cervical spine manual therapy, including mobilization and manipulation, on cervical spine range of motion, joint position sense, and balance is unknown among individuals with cervicogenic headache. Previous studies have indicated improved frequency of headache, decreased perceived disability, and demonstrated improved neuromuscular function following upper cervical manipulation. Other authors report improved cervical spine range of motion, joint position sense, and balance following cervical spine manual therapy for individuals with cervicogenic dizziness. Through an experimental design, this study aims to determine the effects of cervical spine manual therapy on variables such as cervical spine range motion, joint position sense, and balance among individuals with headache of a cervical spine origin. Condition or disease Unilateral Headache Musculoskeletal Neck Pain Procedure: Cervical Spine Mobilization Procedure: Cervical Spine Manipulation Detailed Description: A convenience sample will be utilized to obtain subjects who suffer from cervicogenic headaches, as defined by the International Headache Classification. Subjects will be given an online medical screening questionnaire to differentiate and screen additional types of headache symptoms (migraine, cluster, tension-type, for example) and identify possible contraindications for manual therapy treatment techniques and exclude individuals if necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of three groups (upper cervical mobilization, upper cervical manipulation, or control) and be tested with the Cervical Flexion Rotation Test, Joint Position Error testing, and sensorimotor balance testing via NeuroCom Balance Master. Subjects with cervicogenic headaches will receive their assigned intervention and dependent variables will be reassessed immediately, as well as 4-weeks after initial intervention. Individuals in either intervention group (mobilization or manipulation) will also complete a specific home-exercise program, which has been reported to improve upper cervical range of motion, to the C1/2 segment. Study Design Go to  Pre-test, Post-test, control group design 3 groups - mobilization, manipulation, control Masking: Single (Outcomes Assessor) Masking Description: Assessors of joint position sense, balance, and cervical spine range of motion via the Cervical Flexion Rotation Test will be blinded to group allocation Primary Purpose: Treatment Official Title: Effects of Cervical Spine Manual Therapy on Range of Motion, Joint Position Sense, and Balance in Participants With Cervicogenic Headache Anticipated Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Intervention/treatment Experimental: Cervical Spine Mobilization Group Subjects with cervicogenic headache who will be assigned to cervical spine mobilization group and receive intervention directed to C1/2 of ipsilateral side of unilateral dominant headache. Procedure: Cervical Spine Mobilization C1/2 graded mobilizations (Grade III/IV) provided to C1/2 segment on ipsilateral side of unilateral headache. Mobilizations will be completed for 3 sets of 30 seconds. Experimental: Cervical Spine Manipulation Group Subjects with cervicogenic headache who will be assigned to cervical spine manipulation group and receive intervention directed to C1/2 of ipsilateral side of unilateral dominant headache. Procedure: Cervical Spine Manipulation C1/2 manipulation (Grade V) provided to C1/2 segment on ipsilateral side of unilateral headache. The goal of the manipulation technique is to elicit an audible cavitation. If no cavitation is achieved upon the first attempt, a second and final attempt will be completed. No more than two attempts will be utilized per each subject in this allocated group. No Intervention: Control Group No intervention. Subjects in this groups will wait for 5 minutes between pre- and post-testing of dependent variables. Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Change in Cervical Flexion Rotation Test (CFRT) [ Time Frame: Post-Intervention, 4-weeks ] The Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) instrument will be placed on the subject. The subject will lie supine on the treatment table. The investigator will then passively flex the entire cervical spine and then rotate the head to both the left and right. The range of motion available in each direction, as measured by the CROM, will be recorded. Secondary Outcome Measures : Change in Joint Position Error [ Time Frame: Post-Intervention, 4-weeks ] The subject will have a small laser pointer mounted onto a lightweight headband, which they will wear. The patient will be seated 90 cm from the wall. The starting point that is projected by the laser on the bullseye is marked. The patient will have their eyes closed and will perform an active neck movement. After this, the patient will return their head as accurately as possible to the starting position. This will include 6 trials, which will include cervical flexion, extension and rotation. The final laser position is measured against the starting position in centimeters. Errors will be measured following active return from cervical extension, flexion and rotation. Change in Balance as measured by NeuroCom Balance Master [ Time Frame: Post-Intervention, 4-weeks ] A pre-programmed option on the NeuroCom Balance Master will be utilized to assess the Modified Clinical test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB). Three different conditions will be utilized and each condition will last 30 secs. Three trials will be completed for each condition.First, the subject will be asked to maintain their balance while their eyes are closed. The amount of postural sway that they demonstrate will be recorded. Second, the subject will be asked to maintain their balance with their eyes open while the platform on the NeuroCom Balance Master force plate moves. The amount of postural sway demonstrated will be recorded. Third, the subject will be asked to rotate their head all the way to the left, then rotate their head all the way to the right. They will continue rotating between sides for the duration of the 30 second trial. The amount of postural sway that they demonstrate will be recorded.

Although the majority of patients have a mild disease course, around 20% will develop moderate or severe pancreatitis, with necrosis of the (peri) pancreatic tissue and/or multiple-organ failure. Previous studies have correlated colonic involvement as a prognostic marker in acute pancreatitis. It is well known that translocation of the colonic flora may significantly influence the clinical course of patients with acute pancreatitis. The correlation between collection(s) around colon in CT finding and clinical outcomes has not been studied in necrotizing pancreatitis. In current study, the investigators will do a prospective observational study correlating collection(s) around the colon and clinical course of patients in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Condition or disease Detailed Description: Introduction and rationale of the study: Acute pancreatitis is the leading gastrointestinal cause of hospitalization in the US, with 270,000 admissions annually. Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process which causes a local and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although the majority of patients have a mild disease course, around 20% will develop moderate or severe pancreatitis, with necrosis of the (peri) pancreatic tissue and/or multiple-organ failure About 5-10% of patients develop necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma, the peripancreatic tissue or both. A collection containing variable amounts of both fluid and necrosis associated with necrotizing pancreatitis; the necrosis can involve the pancreatic parenchyma and/or the peri- pancreatic tissues. A mature, encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peri- pancreatic necrosis with well defined inflammatory wall is walled off necrosis (WON). It usually occurs >4 weeks after onset of necrotizing pancreatitis. Colonic involvement may predict disease severity and outcome. Clinical features may appear late in the course. Colonic complications occur in 1% patients with acute pancreatitis with 6-40% occurring with necrotizing pancreatitis. Correlation between colonic wall thickening at CT and the clinical course has already been established in non-necrotizing pancreatitis. Colonic necrosis is an adverse prognostic factor in pancreatic necrosis. Extension of necrosis towards the transverse colon and the splenic flexure were seen most commonly observed. Previous studies have correlated colonic involvement as a prognostic marker in acute pancreatitis. It is well known that translocation of the colonic flora may significantly influence the clinical course of patients with acute pancreatitis. The correlation between collection(s) around colon in CT finding and clinical outcomes has not been studied in necrotizing pancreatitis. Work plan methodology: This will be a prospective, observational study, to be conducted in 20 bed ICU of department of Critical Care Medicine, Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Postgraduate and Medical Sciences, Lucknow. All adult (≥18 years) ICU patients who had acute necrotizing pancreatitis will be considered. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all ICU patients who fulfill inclusion criteria will be collected along with relevant laboratory tests done for patient management routinely. ICU prognostication scores, i.e., Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score will also be recorded. The investigators will review all available computed tomography scans (CT Scans) of abdomen, from 2nd week to 6th week of pancreatitis, which will be done as per treating clinicians during patient ICU stay. Collection around colon is classified as: 1. No pericolonic collection; 2. Less than 90 degree encasement of colon; 3. In between 90-180 degree; 4. More than 180 degree encasement of colon. Other intra-abdominal collection will also be noted along with mesocolon. Clinical course will be followed till ICU discharge in terms of need for drain and surgery, intra-abdominal infection, and survival at discharge. Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis will be done and data will be presented as mean or median. Intervention: None. Waiver of consent has been granted by the Institute Ethics Committee (IEC).

The most severe clinical complication associated with LPLD is acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis in an LPLD subject often leads to prolonged hospital admissions. Subjects who survive repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis may develop chronic pancreatitis, ultimately resulting in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The clinical manifestations of acute pancreatitis episodes related to LPLD are largely indistinguishable from acute pancreatitis due to other causes. However, collection of data relating to hospital admissions, laboratory test results, scan images and adverse events occurring concomitantly to the acute pancreatic episode should allow elimination of other causes of pancreatitis (e.g. gallstones etc) and ultimately allow confirmation of LPLD-related acute pancreatitis. Characterisation of the presentation of symptoms which occur around the time of known episodes of LPLD-related acute pancreatitis should also permit identification of episodes of acute pancreatitis which have previously been considered as unrelated or even unrecognized. Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera®) is in development for the therapy of LPLD. In summary, alipogene tiparvovec contains the human lipoprotein (LPL) gene variant LPLS447X in a non-replicating vector in solution administered in a one-time series of intramuscular injections in the arms/legs. Studies conducted to date with Glybera have evaluated total triglyceride levels as a surrogate marker for efficacy and have not evaluated a clinical endpoint such as acute pancreatitis episodes as a primary endpoint. Post-hoc analysis has suggested that there may be a reduction in the frequency of acute abdominal pancreatitis episodes reported following treatment compared to the frequency reported pre-treatment from past medical history records. The recorded episodes used in this post-hoc analysis were collected from medical history and adverse event data but no uniform criteria were used to classify these as episodes of acute pancreatitis. Review of the post hoc analysis has raised questions that the recorded past medical history of pancreatitis episodes may be inaccurate with respect to diagnosis and number of episodes. In this case record review study, data will be collected on pancreatitis episodes from subjects who previously enrolled in studies PREPARATION-02 (observational), CT-AMT-011-01 and CT-AMT-011-02. In studies CT-AMT-011-01 and CT-AMT-011-02 subjects received AMT-011 at either dose 3 x 1011 gc/kg or 1 x 1012 gc/kg. Data obtained from medical records, hospital admission/discharge charts, laboratory results and imaging scans will be evaluated for evidence of LPLD-related episodes of pancreatitis by an expert review panel. The evaluation will consider data collected from three time periods: subjects entire past medical history, the period after enrolment into study but prior to AMT-011 therapy, the period post-administration of AMT-011. Data from the subjects who did not progress to receive AMT-011 will be evaluated as a control group using data collected from past medical history and from the period after enrolment in the PREPARATION-02.   Eligibility 18 Years to 70 Years Genders Eligible for Study:  "

If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, individual can become eligible. Myocardial infarction, other acute cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 4 months prior to randomization. Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within three months prior to randomization or anticipated use during the study. For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant within the next 24 months. Women who are potential study participants should be questioned about the potential for pregnancy. Patient with non study eye VA: counting finger or worse (i.e. only one seeing eye) will be excluded. Study Eye Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema. An eye should not be considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered to be related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema.

The media from these cells will then be added to culture to determine whether there is stimulation of a hormone that induces high blood pressure (renin) in kidney cells. Estimated Enrollment: Type 2 diabetics with high blood pressure and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of <20 ng/ml Diagnostic Test: Blood draw Blood will be drawn to isolate monocytes after 2 weeks off of blood pressure lowering medications. Vitamin D Sufficient Type 2 diabetics with high blood pressure and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of >30 ng/ml Diagnostic Test: Blood draw Blood will be drawn to isolate monocytes after 2 weeks off of blood pressure lowering medications. Detailed Description: More than half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus develop hypertension, which doubles their risk for cardiovascular disease. Inflammation plays a role in the development of these diseases, and monocytes, a type of white blood cell, may be critical. This study will isolate monocytes from blood samples of patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure who have either high levels of vitamin D or low levels of vitamin D, and determine what their effects are on stimulating production in kidney cells of a hormone that increases blood pressure.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Inhibition of the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the reduction of albuminuria and preservation of renal function in patients with CKD and it is known that the daily intakes of sodium have a significant effect on the activity of RAAS. Dietary sodium restriction has been shown to enhances the blood pressure, albuminuria, and renal function preservation. Furthermore, recent study has shown that intensive low-salt dietary education reduces albuminuria in patients with CKD. The average sodium intake of Koreans is 4,791 mg/d, which is higher than other countries. It is difficult for medical staff in Korea to invest enough time in low salt diet. Recently, the development of health-related applications (apps) has been carried out worldwidely, and researches on lifestyle improvement using apps have been actively studied. However, there is no research yet on whether intensive education using an apps can affect lifestyle habits and thus changes in actual new features. Smartphone apps may provide an alternative to resource-intensive low salt diet-education. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of intensive low salt diet training on the changes of albuminuria using application. Condition or disease

Increased circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a key regulator of phosphorus metabolism, are critical to the pathophysiology of these diseases, most notably in X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). Increased FGF23 induces hypertrophy and scarring in the heart in part via stimulating the traditional renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin (Ang ll), particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease, but the effect of FGF23 on the heart in patients with FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases is unknown. In addition, the relationship between FGF23 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7) pathway of the RAS is unknown. The objective of this study is to describe the relationship between FGF23, which causes low phosphorus levels, and components of the RAS in the blood and urine to help us understand why the disease occurs and how to better treat it. Subjects will be identified by querying the Electronic Medical Record according to medical diagnosis. Thirty subjects, 2-24 years of age, will be recruited from the tertiary care Pediatric Endocrinology and Pediatric Nephrology clinics at Brenner Children's Hospital. Inclusion criteria include a confirmed diagnosis of hereditary FGF23-related hypophosphatemia. Clinical data will be obtained from the Electronic Medical Record. Each subject will undergo study assessments at baseline, 6 months and 1 year that include blood work, an echocardiogram, and blood pressure measurements. The primary hypothesis is that subjects with higher Ang-(1-7) levels have lower rates of cardiac hypertrophy and thus are protected against high FGF23 levels. The secondary hypothesis is that subjects with higher Ang-(1-7) levels have lower systolic blood pressure. Condition or disease Hypophosphatemia X-linked Hypophosphatemia Renin-angiotensin System Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Diagnostic Test: Ang II and Ang-(1-7) Diagnostic Test: FGF23 and klotho Detailed Description: Clinical data will be collected from the Electronic Medical Record, including age, sex, parent-reported race, past medical and family histories, and current medications. We will calculate body mass index and define overweight/obesity as a body mass index ≥85% percentile for age and sex. We will calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate to measure renal function based on serum creatinine standardized to age, sex, and height. Blood (less than 5 mL) and urine samples will be collected at each study visit at the same time as routine clinical labs. Ang ll and Ang-(1-7) will be measured in the plasma and urine using radioimmunoassays in a CLIA-certified laboratory within the Hypertension and Vascular Research Biomarker Analytical Core at Wake Forest School of Medicine. We will calculate the ratio of the two peptides and, in the urine, standardize their values to urine creatinine. In the blood, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D will be collected and in the urine, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine will be collected all per standard of care. FGF23 and klotho will be analyzed in the Core via commercially available ELISA's. All patients receive baseline and, if abnormal, follow-up echocardiograms to evaluate for left ventricular hypertrophy. Blood pressure will be measured at clinic visits. Because age, sex, and height define normative pediatric values, we will standardize blood pressure with z scores. Study Design Go to

Detailed Description: High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major cause of heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. Natriuretic peptides are cardiac derived hormones that may protect against hypertension. The classical actions of the natriuretic peptides include natriuresis, vasodilation, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which support a key role for these hormones in blood pressure regulation. Race based differences exist in the risk and severity of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, with African-American individuals typically being at greater risk compared with white individuals. Nearly half of African-American adults have hypertension, compared with one-third of whites. Additionally, salt-sensitivity denotes the impaired ability to handle a salt load with resulting increases in blood pressure. It is estimated that 75% of hypertensive African-Americans exhibit salt-sensitivity, compared with 35% of hypertensive whites. Why this predilection towards salt-sensitivity exists, particularly among African-American individuals, is not well understood. Thus, establishing the origins of salt retention in African Americans has biologic, preventative, and therapeutic importance, and may provide insight regarding racial differences in cardiovascular risk. The natriuretic peptide system is the principal counter-regulatory mechanism to salt retention. However, little is known regarding racial differences in the natriuretic peptide system. Recently, it was discovered that African-Americans have lower natriuretic peptide levels compared with whites, raising the possibility that African-Americans individuals can have a relative ""natriuretic peptide deficiency"" with reduced natriuretic peptide responses to salt loading. However, the prior studies were based on epidemiologic data with individuals on random salt backgrounds. This highlights the need for more detailed physiologic studies, under controlled salt conditions and with standardized assessment of the natriuretic peptide and RAAS and tissue sodium stores. The aim of this study is to assess the natriuretic peptide response to dietary salt loading in African-American individuals compared with white individuals. This study will test the primary hypothesis that compared with whites, African-American individuals have blunted natriuretic peptide responses to dietary salt loading. Secondary hypotheses include: Compared with white individuals, African-American individuals have higher baseline tissue sodium content, and Compared with white individuals, African-American individuals have impaired ""target organ"" responses to salt loading, as manifested by higher blood pressure and increased frequency of salt-sensitive hypertension, decreased urinary sodium excretion, less suppression of plasma renin and serum aldosterone, and lack of increase in left ventricular early diastolic relaxation velocities.   Eligibility 18 Years to 55 Years Genders Eligible for Study:  "

This imaging approach is standard of care for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD), and has never been successfully applied to PAD. Preliminary results show distinct patterns of muscle perfusion between healthy and PAD patients, and thus great promise of the technique. The investigators will first verify the reproducibility of the technique, and then compare the calf muscle perfusion measures in PAD patients against healthy age-matched controls. This comparison will test the feasibility of detecting functional abnormality in PAD patients. After the baseline scans, the PAD patients will opt to undergo a 12-week supervised exercise therapy, and then a post-therapy MRI scan. Comparison of the pre- and post-therapy measurements will indicate how the therapy improves the calf-muscle perfusion, and how this perfusion change correlates with increases in patient's walking ability. The long term goals of this project are to develop an improved diagnostic test for patients with PAD to predict who will benefit from therapeutic intervention. The MRI perfusion studies of calf muscle can be performed in conjunction with routine peripheral MR angiography to assess the functional significance of vascular stenosis. Condition or disease Study Design Go to  Stress-rest Calf Muscle Perfusion: a Functional Diagnostic Test for Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) Actual Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Subjects without PAD who have the same average age as the PAD patients Experimental: PAD Patients Patients with PAD. Approximately 75% of PAD patients will be enrolled in the 12-week exercise therapy program. Behavioral: Supervised exercise therapy The therapy will be conducted three times each week for 12 weeks. Each session takes 1 hour, consisting of 5 minutes of warmup activities, 50 minutes of intermittent exercise, and 5 minutes of cool-down activities. Exercise consists of walking on a treadmill initiated at 2 mph and 0% grade, until claudication pain becomes moderately severe. After claudication pain subsides, the subject will restart the walk. At the end of the session, the total exercise duration will be recorded. After a patient is able to walk 8-10 minutes at the initial workload, the grade is increased by 1-2%, or the speed is increased by 0.5 mph as tolerated.

The investigator performed extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). This experiment used a randomized experiment to assess the immediate, short-term and long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on patients with nocturnal leg cramps. Condition or disease Procedure: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy Procedure: General physical therapy Not Applicable Detailed Description: Nocturnal leg cramps (NLCs) are often described as a symptom of sudden and involuntary muscle contraction at night, which often affects sleep quality due to pain and tight discomfort in the thigh, calf and foot. The pathophysiology of nocturnal leg cramps is unclear, but it is generally considered to be associated with excitability lower motor neurons, sleep posture at night, leg muscle fatigue, nerve disability or damage (eg, Parkinson's disease), metabolic diseases (eg : hyperphosphatemia). Generally, quinine or magnesium oxide is the most commonly used pharmacological treatment. The common non-drug treatments are stretching exercise, massage or hot therapy, but there is not enough evidence to indicate which treatment is specific effective. In a previous study, they proposed that nocturnal leg cramps may be associated with myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) of the gastrocnemius. Other studies have also proposed that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) applying to the MTrPs of the upper trapezius muscle could improve cervicogenic headache. We will conduct a randomized parallel study to investigate the efficacy of ESWT on nocturnal leg cramps. Participants will be randomized into two groups: one is only general physical therapy (gPT) and the other one is ESWT + gPT. The outcome measurement tools including the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps, visual analog scale (VAS), pain pressure threshold (PPT) and muscle tone in the gastrocnemius, range of motion of knee and ankle, and quality of sleep questionnaire were used to compare two groups with regard to the pain intensity, quality of sleep, and overall satisfaction in subjects with nocturnal leg cramps. Study Design Go to  Treatment Official Title: Effectiveness of Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy on the Patients With Nocturnal Leg Cramps - Possible Related to Myofascial Trigger Point in the Gastrocnemius Muscle Estimated Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Intervention/treatment Experimental: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy and general physical therapy In this arm, the subjects will receive the intervention of extracorporeal shock wave therapy and general physical therapy 3 times a week for 2 weeks, in total 6 times treatments and will be arrange to take efficacy two assessment on 1 week and 2 weeks after 6 times treatments separately. Procedure: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is a mechanical sound wave that generates energy by extremely high-frequency vibration to compress the medium. Low-energy extracorporeal shock waves can be used for cell regeneration and pain control therapy; medium-high energy can be used to treat patients with poor bone healing; high-energy can be used to lithotrite. In recent years, extracorporeal shock waves have been applied on the musculoskeletal diseases, such as: epicondylitis, plantar fasciitis, chronic pelvic pain, chronic heel pain syndrome, lymphedema, burns, pressure sores, calcific tendinitis and myofascial pain syndrome. This treatment is a non-invasive and safe treatment. Procedure: General physical therapy The general physical therapies such as: thermotherapy, straight leg raise (SLR), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for treatment on calf muscle. Active Comparator: Only general physical therapy In this arm, the subjects will only receive the intervention of general physical therapy 3 times a week for 2 weeks, in total 6 times treatments and will be arrange to take efficacy two assessment on 1 week and 2 weeks after 6 times treatments separately. Procedure: General physical therapy The general physical therapies such as: thermotherapy, straight leg raise (SLR), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for treatment on calf muscle. Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : The frequency of nocturnal leg cramps (FC) [ Time Frame: 1 day ] Ask participants to describe the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps (NLCs) in the last week. The frequency of occurrence is recorded on an average of several times a day (times/day). The frequency of nocturnal leg cramps (FC) can be used as a tracking and indicator of treatment. Secondary Outcome Measures : Visual Analog Scales (VAS) [ Time Frame: 1 day ] The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. This tool used to help a person rate the intensity of certain sensations and feelings, such as pain. A straight line of 100mm is actually marked with 0 mm on the far left and 100mm on the far right. Two faces are drawn on both ends. Explain to the patient that 0 mm means no pain and 100 mm means very painful. From the left end The right shift indicates more and more pain. Take a pen and let the patient draw a short line vertically on the line, representing his painful position, and record the measured cm value. In this test, if the score of the subject decreases, it can represent the treatment is helpful for the improvement of the patient's pain. Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) [ Time Frame: 1 day ] Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain. This measure has proven to be commonly useful in evaluating tenderness symptom Range of Motion of knee and ankle joint [ Time Frame: 1 day ] Range of motion of knee and ankle joint will be limited when the calf muscle with active myofasical trigger point. To record range of motion of knee and ankle joint for tracking the efficacy of treatment. Muscle tone [ Time Frame: 1 day ] Muscle tone is the muscle's resistance to passive stretch during resting state. The measuring tool called Myotone will calculate three parameters such as tone, elasticity and stiffness automatically and get a value to represent the muscle tone. If the value decrease, it can represent the treatment is helpful for the subjective muscle relax. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) [ Time Frame: 1 day ] The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) is currently the most effective assessment tool for assessing sleep quality and status in adults. It can be used to assess and track changes in sleep quality after treatment. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI) content includes (1) subjective sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbance, (6) daytime function, and (7) the condition of using sleep pills. The score of the item is from 0 to 3 points, and the total score is from 0 to 21 points. The higher the score means the worse the quality of sleep. If the total score is greater than 5 points that means the poor quality of sleep.

Estimated Enrollment: December 2017 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure) Detailed Description: Patients with inherited muscle diseases can have several miscellaneous problems in their muscles, which can be both structural and metabolic. Depending on the specific disease multiple symptoms may be present. All the different diseases can affect the contractility of the muscles. Examples of inherited muscle diseases are congenital myopathies and RYR1-myopathy, afflicting the muscle fiber structure. They are the first subgroups of inherited muscle diseases to be investigated in this study. Congenital myopathies are hereditary and relatively non-progressive diseases. Hypotonia is the clinical characteristic of congenital myopathies and is often presented already in the neonatal period. Almost all patients have generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia. The various subtypes of congenital myopathy are a broad group of disorders defined by the predominance of particular and specific structural abnormalities shown in muscle biopsies. Based on genetic and morphological features, they can be divided into four main groups; one with central cores, one with central nuclei, one with minicores and one with nemaline bodies. RYR1-myopathy is caused by a mutation in the RYR-gene. The RYR1-protein is important in the making of RYR1-receptors and channels responsible for the transport of calcium atoms within muscle cells, particularly in muscle contractions. Patients typically present with limb weakness, decreased fetal movement and skeletal abnormalities. About 70% of patients with malignant hyperthermia have a mutation in the RYR1-gene. MRI findings often include involvement of different muscles in the thigh and the calf.   Eligibility 18 Years to 80 Years   (Adult, Senior) Genders Eligible for Study:  "

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03763357 Recruitment Status : Not yet recruiting First Posted : December 4, 2018 Last Update Posted : December 4, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Raghu Motaganahalli, Indiana University Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to apply local heat to the legs, thighs and buttocks of patients with peripheral arterial disease and use PET/CT imaging with an injectable stable radiotracer to study direct measurement of blood flow in the legs pre and post heat treatment. Condition or disease Device: Control/Sham Treatment Device: Heat Therapy (HT) Not Applicable Detailed Description: Cilostazol is the only effective medication available to treat walking pain (intermittent claudication) and it has multiple side effects. Overall improvement in walking performance in patients who use cilostazol is small. Endovascular and surgical interventions are effective alternatives for patients who don't respond to medical therapy, however, these procedures are costly and only applicable to patients with certain lesions types and carry a high risk of restenosis. Heat therapy (HT) is an emerging non-invasive approach that has been shown to enhance vascular function of the leg in old individuals. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a single session of heat therapy will increase local muscle tissue blood flow in the calf of patients with PAD as assessed by PET/CT imaging of generator-based 62Cu-ETS. Subjects who have met inclusion criteria will volunteer for a single experimental visit. Participants will wear the water circulating pants and asked to rest supine for 30 minutes inside the scanner. In the control/sham condition, thermoneutral water (33 degrees C) will be perfused through the garment for 90 minutes. In the heat condition, water at 43 degrees C will be perfused through the pants for 90 minutes with the goal to increase skin temperature in the calf to 39 degrees C. IV injections of 62Cu-ETS and subsequent perfusion imaging will be performed at the end of the 30 minute baseline period, after 45 minutes of HT or sham/control and at the end of the intervention (90 minutes). Due to the short half life of 62Cu, radioactivity from the prior administrations will not interfere with acquisition of a subsequent PET scan at this timing interval. Study Design Go to  Parallel Assignment Intervention Model Description: Half of the subjects in this study will receive the control/sham treatment and half of the subjects in this study will receive heat therapy.

The proteins are encoded by genes from both the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the nucleus, making some of the disorders maternally inherited and some autosomal recessive or dominant. The mitochondria are found in almost all cells in the body and are the main source of energy. The energy is produced through the electron transport chain, which is composed of four multi subunit complexes (I to IV). A mutation in one or more of these complexes is a typical cause of a mitochondrial disease. Since the mitochondria are found in almost every cell, mitochondrial disease can give rise to symptoms from many organs. The symptoms depend on what kind of mutation the patient has, but usually includes muscular and neurological problems, as these cells have especially high energy needs. It is believed that the muscle weakness in mitochondrial diseases is caused by the reduced ability to produce energy. However, recent research has suggested that there is a structural change in the muscles as well. The hypothesis is that this structural change in the muscles will affect its function. The aim of the study is to investigate the relation between muscle strength and contractile cross sectional area (CCSA) in the calf of patients affected by mitochondrial diseases. In healthy individuals there is a close relation between strength and CCSA, as the strength will decrease according to a decrease in CCSA. In mitochondrial disease, the hypothesis is that there can be a disrupted relationship between strength and CCSA. The investigators will recruit 30 subjects with verified mitochondrial disease, and compare the results to that of healthy individuals (results from an earlier research project). A Dixon MRI will be used to find the CCSA of the calf muscle and a muscle dynamometer will be used to find the strength. These two variables are compared.   Eligibility

The Centers of Disease Control advocates for low sodium, senior meal plans as a strategy to lower blood pressure (BP). However, sodium is recommended to treat orthostatic hypotension (OH), a risk factor of falls. The long-term effects of low sodium intake on physical function are largely unknown in older adults. The objective of this proposed pilot study is to determine the feasibility of an individual-level, randomized feeding study that examines the impact of sodium reduction on BP regulation among 40 semi-independent, older adults aged 60 and above. Primary Aim 1: To determine the effects of a low sodium (<0.9 mg per kcal of energy intake), 2-week meal plan compared with a usual meal plan (average sodium ~2 mg per kcal of energy intake) on seated BP among independently living older adults. Hypothesis Aim 1: Compared with the usual meal plan, a reduced sodium meal plan will lower seated BP in older adults after 2 weeks. Feasibility Aim 1: To evaluate the recruitment experience, meal cost, meal delivery logistics, and compliance with and tolerability of the meal plan (urine sodium and palatability questionnaires). Feasibility Aim 2: To determine effect size (variance) of secondary outcomes: standing BP, OH (standing minus seated BP), orthostatic symptoms, and a timed up and go test (TUG). Eligible participants will be randomized to low versus usual sodium meal plans for two weeks. Assessments will be made at the in-person baseline visit, one week telephonic interview and 2 week in person follow-up visit. The primary outcome is seated BP and secondary outcomes include orthostatic hypertension and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests. Both primary and secondary outcomes will be measured twice: (1) before the study begins (baseline), and (2) after 2 week period. Patient-reported outcomes, dietary compliance, and urine electrolytes will be assessed as well. Intent-to-treat analysis will be conducted for all endpoints.

Condition or disease Phase Overweight and Obesity Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Metabolic Syndrome Genetic Predisposition Diet Modification Other: Normo-carbohydrate meal intake Other: High-carbohydrate meal intake Other: High-fat meal intake Other: High-protein meal intake Not Applicable Detailed Description: This is a randomized, crossover study that includes 1 screening visit and four meal challenge test visits, separated by a 1-2-weeks washout period. The screening will include 2000 people, males and females, to evaluate the genotype frequencies in studied population, and to find carriers of the rare genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), who will fulfill all the other inclusion criteria. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be completed at screening visit. Moreover, the fasting blood samples will be collected for genetic analysis, and measurements of blood glucose and lipid metabolism profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), hormones/peptides and other factors involved in energy balance regulation. Subjects will be asked to record their daily food intake for 3 days. Assessments of vital signs and body height and weight, waist and hip circumferences, body fat content and body fat distribution, review of concomitant medication/supplement use and inclusion and exclusion criteria, and evaluation of adverse effects will be performed throughout the study. To meal challenge test only men will be included, since the sex hormones may influence the study endpoints. Subjects will be encouraged to maintain their habitual diet during wash-out periods. During the each meal challenge test subjects will consume one of the study meals in random order. The blood will be collected at fasting state and 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes after meal intake. The energy expenditure and substrate utilization will be measured by indirect calorimetry method at the fasting and postprandially.

Read our disclaimer for details. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03703726 Recruitment Status : Active, not recruiting First Posted : October 12, 2018 Last Update Posted : October 12, 2018 Sponsor: Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Information provided by (Responsible Party): Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Study Details Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Food fortification is regarded as a safe and cost-effective approach to counteract and prevent iron deficiency. Rice is a staple food for millions of people living in regions where iron-deficiency anaemia is a significant public health problem. Therefore, rice may be a promising fortification vehicle. Hot and cold extrusion, have been identified as the major methods for rice fortification. Extruded rice has the advantage of incorporating vitamins and minerals into the food matrix. Cold, warm and hot extrusion differ in the processing temperature and the physical structure of fortified rice kernel matrix. A recent human study in young women showed fractional iron absorption was higher in cold extruded rice compared to hot extruded Rice and this was associated with changes in the starch microstructure. These changes cannot be detected in warm extruded rice, thus, our aim is to test the iron bioavailability in difference extrusion methods; hot and warm and cold with and without the solubilizing agent CA/TSC. This will provide information on optimized rice formulations for optimal iron delivery.

Endoscopic therapy significantly reduces further bleeding, surgery, and mortality in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and is now recommended as the first hemostatic modality for these patients. In the past few years, adjuvant use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after endoscopic therapy has been endorsed in some studies. However, low dose of PPI has also been supported in the management of these patients. The investigators enroll 130 patients with active bleeding or nonbleeding visible vessels in this study. They are randomly assigned as 40 mg/day or 160mg/day IV nexium group. All patients receive successful endoscopic therapy with heater probe or hemoclip placement. In the low dose group (N=65), 40 mg IV Nexium daily is given for three days. Thereafter, the patients receive 40 mg nexium orally daily for two months. In the large dose group (N=65), 160 mg/day continuous infusion is given for three days. Thereafter, the patients receive 40 mg nexium orally daily for two months. The primary end point is recurrent bleeding before discharge and within 14 days. At day 14, volume of blood transfused, number of surgeries performed, and the mortality rates of the two groups are compared as well.

Detailed Description: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the top 5 most widely used drugs in the world. PPIs suppress the formation of gastric acid through the inhibition of hydrogen-potassium-adenosine-triphosphatase (H+ / K+ -ATPase) - a known proton pump in the parietal cells of the stomach. In practice, PPIs are commonly prescribed to treat GI disorders such as peptic ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux. They are also used prophylactically to prevent stress ulcers and to reduce GI toxicity associated with certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and steroids, sometimes despite a paucity of evidence. PPI use has been associated with increased risk of enteric infections. A meta-analysis of 23 studies, comprising almost 300.000 patients, showed a 65% increase in the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea among patients who used PPIs. Another meta-analysis of 11.280 patients, from six studies evaluating Salmonella, Campylobacter and other enteric infections, also found an increased risk due to acid suppression, with a greater association with PPI than with H2-receptor antagonists. Moreover, long term PPI use has been shown to be associated with bowel symptoms: A study from 2011 reported incidences of bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain and diarrhoea (43%, 17%, 7% and 2% of selected cases, respectively). In addition, PPIs are known to cause malabsorption of Vitamin B12 which may ultimately lead to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Very recently, PPI use was associated with an increase in mortality. The gut microbiome plays an important role in enteric infections and bowel symptoms. The composition of the gut microbiome can inhibit or promote the microbial colonisation of the gut by microbial pathogens. Several mechanisms can influence bacterial growth or the immune system. Long term PPI use is associated with profound changes in the gut microbiome. It is believed that these conditions are caused through the long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion (and thus shifting intragastric pH) which alters the natural habitat of resident microbiota. Furthermore, increased gastric pH might not sufficiently protect against oral or food-borne pathogens. We recently conducted a study at the Medical University of Graz where we could show that patients with long-term PPI therapy have dysbiosis associated with intestinal inflammation, increased gut permeability, bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation associated with a higher risk of complications and mortality in liver cirrhosis. (A. Horvath et al., Long-term proton pump inhibitor use increases intestinal dysbiosis, gut permeability, inflammation and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis, UEG Journal, accepted) Probiotics are live microorganisms that have been demonstrated to alter gut flora and exhibit positive effects on numerous gastrointestinal complaints, strengthen the gut barrier and reduce inflammation parameters We hypothesize that a three months probiotic intervention with OMNi BiOTiC PPI improves PPI induced dysbiosis, intestinal inflammation and gut permeability in patients on long term PPI therapy, leading to a decrease in bacterial translocation and a better gastrointestinal quality of life.   Eligibility 18 Years and older   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

PPi prevents the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals on tissues by precipitation of calcium and inorganic phosphate (Pi). It is an endogenous compound whose deficiency causes diffuse vascular calcifications in certain rare monogenic diseases, including the elastic pseudoxanthoma caused by the mutation of ABCC6. PPi is produced by enzymatic transformation of extracellular ATP and, in animals, the liver is the main supplier of ATP and PPi (more than 90%). In humans, liver transplantation offers the possibility of correlating the plasma concentration of PPi ([PPi]pl) with hepatic expression of ABCC6. Liver transplantation is performed in the treatment of chronic liver failure (Child B or C) or, in the absence of liver failure, in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. By measuring[PPi]pl before transplantation and after liver function restoration and by measuring ABCC6 in the diseased liver and healthy liver, it is possible to determine whether liver failure is associated with decreased[PPi]pl and decreased liver expression of ABCC6, which is the objective of our pilot study. Its interest is to establish a physiopathological link between the frequent vascular calcifications in obese patients with hepatic steatosis and the production of PPi. prupose: Look for a deficit in[PPi]pl in patients before the transplant compared to the phase of restoration of liver function Condition or disease

The cure of the H. pylori infection prevents recurrence of duodenal and gastric ulcer and improves dyspepsia in a significant proportion of cases, so it is cost-effective. Eradication therapy has changed over time. The usually recommended pattern in the consensus conferences has traditionally been triple therapy, composed by the combination of 2 antibiotics (clarithromycin plus amoxicillin or metronidazole) and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 7-14 days. Recent meta-analyses have that the current global eradication rate after standard triple therapy is less than 80%. Several European studies have found even lower eradication rates, with 35-40% of cases resulting in treatment failure. Treatment failure leads to a second treatment and a new diagnostic test to confirm eradication. Drug: PPI, amoxicillin, metronidazole and clarithromycin Phase 4 Primary Purpose: Treatment Official Title: Phase 4, Prospective, Randomized and Comparative Study Comparing Sequential and Concomitant Therapy for Helicobacter Pylori Eradication in Routine Clinical Practice Resource links provided by NLM: Further study details as provided by Hospital Universitario de la Princesa: Primary Outcome Measures: ""Intention to treat"" eradication rates [ Time Frame: One year ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] ""Intention-to-treat"" eradication of infection.

Estimated Enrollment: Active Comparator: Sequential treatment: Drug: PPI, amoxicillin, metronidazole and clarithromycin Dual therapy for 5 days: PPI and 1g amoxicillin every 12h. After dual therapy continue with a triple therapy for 5 days: PPI, 1g amoxicillin, 500 mg metronidazole and 500 mg clarithromycin every 12h. Experimental: Concomitant treatment Drug: PPI, amoxicillin, metronidazole and clarithromycin Quadruple therapy for ten days:PPI, 1g amoxicillin, 500 mg metronidazole and 500 mg clarithromycin every 12h Detailed Description: Justification of the study: One of the latest therapeutic innovations is sequential therapy, introduced in Italy by Zullo et al. The drug delivery strategy involves a 5-day induction phase with dual therapy (a PPI every 12 hours and amoxicillin 1g every 12 hours), followed immediately by triple therapy for 5 days with a PPI every 12 hours, metronidazole 500 mg every 12 hours and clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours. Sequential therapy has proved more effectiveness than standard triple therapy for seven and ten days. In order to assess the efficacy of this new treatment in our area, over the past year we conducted a multicentre observational pilot study in routine clinical practice conditions in patients infected with H. pylori and with indications for eradication. 139 patients from 6 different centres were included. Excellent treatment compliance and minimal side effects, similar to those described with triple therapy, were shown. The results confirm similar efficacy to that obtained in previous studies and an eradication rate significantly higher than that obtained with classic triple therapy in our area. Several previous studies have shown excellent efficacy of quadruple therapy with a PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole, administering ""concomitantly"" the same drugs as those of sequential therapy, but only for 5-7 days. Several studies have found a higher eradication rate of this ""concomitant"" therapy as compared with classic triple therapy. The results of a randomized study in which sequential and concomitant therapy were compared have recently been reported in the American Congress of Gastroenterology. Eradication and adverse events rates were similar with both treatments. This data suggest that the ""sequentially""administration of these drugs probably complicated unnecessarily the treatment. Therefore it is necessary to make a controlled clinical trial to directly compare ""sequential"" versus ""concomitant"" therapy. The results of this study will conclude which should be the first line treatment for H. pylori eradication.   Eligibility"

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03793556 First Posted : January 4, 2019 Last Update Posted : January 4, 2019 Sponsor: Information provided by (Responsible Party): SOFAR S.p.A. Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of a 6-weeks treatment of a combination oral formulation of hyaluronic acid with chondroitin sulphate and aluminium hydroxide (GERDOFF®), in addition to proton pump inhibitors (PPI) at the standard dose, versus PPI only, in patients with first diagnosed clinical presentation of extra-esophageal GERD symptoms. The investigators will verify the reduction of symptoms frequency, using a Likert questionnaire, and severity, using the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) questionnaire, to evaluate the proportion of Responders and Non-Responder patients in these two groups after 6 weeks of treatment, compared to baseline. Moreover we will evaluate the persistence of effects of GERDOFF® + PPI treatment on extraesophageal symptoms, after a 12-weeks follow up, only in responder patients Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Cough, hoarseness, prolonged voice lowering, and vocal timbre modification, without any documentable cause, are considered as minor disorders for which patients do not receive adequate attention. These disorders may represent extra-esophageal manifestations of gastro-oesophagea reflux. Accurate diagnosis and gastro-oesophageal reflux therapy have been proved as useful to improve patients' quality of life. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of treatment for 6 weeks with a preparation based on chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid and aluminum hydroxide (GERDOFF®), combined with a treatment with inhibitors of the proton pump (PPI) only in patients presenting associated extra-esophageal symptoms to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in first diagnosis. The investigators will evaluate the reduction of symptoms frequency, using a Likert questionnaire, and severity, using the RSI questionnaire (Reflux Symptom Index), in patients with the association and to evaluate Responders and Non-Responder patients in these two groups after 6 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. After 12-week follow-up, the investigators will evaluate the persistence of effects of GERDOFF® + PPI on extraesophageal symptoms, only in responder patients (enrolled in the arm GERDOFF + PPI) who have reached an RSI score lower at least 50% than baseline and an absolute value <13. Patients who will be included in the follow-up will be randomized in the GERDOFF® group or in the control group (no treatment). Study Design Go to  Parallel Assignment Intervention Model Description: Patients will be randomized in ratio 1:1 and treated with the investigational drug or an active comparator for 6 weeks. At the end of treatment visit (V4) only patients who will be classified as responders and belonging to the GERDOFF®+PPI group will be included in the follow-up phase for 12 further weeks. During the follow-up, patients will be randomized to 1:1 ratio to GERDOFF® group or control group that will not receive any treatment for 12 weeks in order to evaluate the maintenance of treatment effects.

Actual Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Intervention/treatment Experimental: GERDOFF® + omeprazole GERDOFF® (tablets) will be orally administered 3 times per day after meals; omeprazole will be orally administered once a day before breakfast (2 tablets). The treatment will last 6 weeks (+/- 2 days). Device: GERDOFF® GERDOFF® Hyaluronic acid + chondroitin sulphate + hydroxide aluminium Melt-in-mouth tablet 1100 mg Active Comparator: Omeprazole Omeprazole will be orally administered once a day before breakfast (2 tablets). The treatment will last 6 weeks (+/- 2 days). Drug: Omeprazole Omeprazole, 2 tablets 20 mg, once a day before breakfast Other Name: Omeprazen Outcome Measures Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Primary Outcome Measures : Improvement of high symptoms of GERDOFF + omeprazole versus omeprazole [ Time Frame: In the first visit (baseline) and in the visit 4 (after 6 weeks of treatment) ] After 6 weeks of treatment, the changes from baseline in the score of Reflux Index Symptoms questionnaire will be evaluated to verify the effects of treatments on high symptoms. Secondary Outcome Measures : Reduction of symptoms frequency [ Time Frame: In the first visit (baseline) and in the visit 4 (after 6 weeks of treatment) ] Reduction of symptoms frequency after 6 weeks of treatment, evaluated by the Likert scale Number of responders after 6 weeks of treatment [ Time Frame: In the visit 4, after 6 weeks of treatment ] Number of patients randomized in the group GERDOFF + PPI and who respond to treatment Percentage of responders after 6 weeks of treatment [ Time Frame: In the visit 4, after 6 weeks of treatment ] Percentage of patients randomized in the group GERDOFF + PPI and who respond to treatment Number of responders after the 12-week follow-up [ Time Frame: In the visit 6 (after the12-week follow-up) ] Number of Responder patients previously randomized in the group GERDOFF + PPI who maintain a symptoms improvement throughout the study.
