ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03999502 First Posted : June 26, 2019 Last Update Posted : June 26, 2019 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Erasme University Hospital Study Description Go to  Brief Summary: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients. However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure. The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Approximately 250 million subjects worldwide and 30 million subjects in the US suffer from GERD. Among the 12 million Americans who suffer from daily heart-burn (the main symptom of GERD) almost 5 million do not respond completely to medications and many more do not want or cannot take medications due to side-effects (1). The goals of treatment in GERD are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis if present, prevent recurrence of symptoms and esophagitis, and prevent complications. Medical acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) heals esophagitis, relieves symptoms and improves quality of life. However, acid suppressive therapy does not correct the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter and hence symptoms of reflux due to weakly acidic or non-acid reflux persist in the majority of subjects who present with symptoms persisting on PPIs (regurgitations) (2). Abnormalities in the structure and function of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) such as a permanently open EGJ, a hiatal hernia, a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and transient LES relaxations (t-LESR) are the main pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to GERD (3). Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients (4,5). However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure (6,7). The results reported from operations performed in community hospital lower volume centers have been different than those achieved in centers of excellence. It has been reported that between 23% and 62% of patients who have undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication use acid suppression medications at long-term follow-up. Due to these issues patient and physician acceptance of surgical procedures remains low and is mainly limited to patients with severe GERD or those non-responsive to medications. For these reasons, less invasive endoscopic techniques to treat GERD have been developed during the last 2 decades, which may be categorized into 3 groups: (1) sewing/plication at the cardia and EGJ, (2) radiofrequency (RF) thermal therapy to the LES, and (3) injection/implantation of biopolymers at the EGJ. Minimally invasive endoluminal procedures for GERD are designed to provide long-lasting symptom relief and abolish or lessen medication dependency. Most endoluminal modalities that were introduced into clinical practice have failed due to lack of long-term efficacy, complications, or interruption of commercialization due to financial difficulties of the companies that developed the techniques (8,9). Endoscopic sewing/plication techniques comprised mucosal plications (Endocinch) that were not clinically useful because the plications were not durable, and full-thickness (serosa-to-serosa) plications allowing prolonged durability (NDO Plicator device and Esophyx device). The data from the RCTs with Plicator device were encouraging and the finding of better results with multiple plications without an increase in adverse events supported that this device could have clinical utility. However, the company ceased operations in 2008 and the device is no longer clinically available (10). Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) using Esophyx showed promising results in open studies (11). However, long-term follow-up revealed that a majority of patients required either ongoing PPI use or were referred for LNF owing to persistent symptoms (12). Endomina-v2 (Endo Tools Therapeutics SA, Rue Auguste Piccard 48, 6041 GOSSELIES, Belgium) is a CE marked device that can be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows manipulation of angulated tools during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibility to perform transoral surgical full thickness sutures and transoral endoscopic gastroplasty has shown to be safe and effective at mid-term follow-up in obese patients (13). The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use.

RCT.######Condition:######Achalasia######Intervention:######Procedure:######Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM)######Sponsor:######Catholic University of the Sacred Heart Recruiting######Non-inferiority of a Short-POEM compared to a Long-POEM [ Time Frame: 2 years ] Treatment success, defined as an Eckard score ≤ 3. The Eckardt score is a clinical score for evaluating the severity of achalasia-related symptoms. Eckardt score varies between 0 and 12. Questions are asked about the frequency of dysphagia, regurgitation and retrosternal pressure sensation. Depending on whether any of these symptom occurrs, never, occasionally, daily or with each meal, a symptom score between 0 and 3 is applied. In addition a symptom score of 0-3 is assigned to the degree of weight loss (0 - No weight loss; 1 - weight loss < 5Kg, 2 - weight loss between 5 and 10Kg, 3- weight loss > 10Kg). Each symptom score (dysphagia, regurgitation, retrosternal pressure, and wieight loss) is summed to the other. Thus, a completely asymptomatic patient has a score of 0 and the most severely affected patient had a maximum score of 12. Secondary Outcome Measures : Basal Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) pressure [ Time Frame: Before POEM, 6 months and 2 years after the procedure ] Basal LES pressure on esophageal manometry after Short-POEM compared to Long-POEM 4-second Integrated Relaxation Pressure (4sIRP) [ Time Frame: Before POEM, 6 months and 2 years after the procedure ] 4sIRP on esophageal manometry after Short-POEM compared to Long-POEM Side effects and complications [ Time Frame: Baseline to 2 years ] Incidence of side effect and complications after Short-POEM compared to Long-POEM Gastro-Esophageal Reflux (GER) symptom assessment [ Time Frame: baseline, 6 months and 2 years after POEM ] GerdQ questionnaire will be used to evaluate and compare Gastoesophageal reflux symptoms in the two groups. GerdQ is a 6-item, validated, easy to use questionnaire. The GerdQ questionnaire asks patients to score the number of days with symptoms and use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications during the previous 7 days. It uses a four graded Likert scale (0-3) to score the frequency of four positive predictors of GERD (heartburn, regurgitation, sleep disturbance due to reflux symptoms or use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications for reflux symptoms) and a reversed Likert scale (3-0) for two negative predictors of GERD (epigastric pain and nausea) giving a total GerdQ score range of 0-18. The sleep disturbance and use of OTC medication are also used for assessment of the impact of GERD, giving a separate 'impact score' ranging from 0 to 6 Esophageal pH-monitoring study [ Time Frame: 6 months after POEM ] patients will undergo esophageal pH-monitoring study during the follow-up. DeMeester score will be used for the diagnosis of GERD. DeMeester score is a composite score based on 6 parameters (scored in comparison to mean values in normal subjects for each category below): Supine reflux, Upright reflux, Total reflux, Number of episodes, Number of episodes longer than 5 min, Longest episode. A score of >14.72 shows significant reflux. Prevalence of GERD will be compared in the two study groups Operating time [ Time Frame: During the endoscopic procedure ] The duration of the endoscopic procedures for each patients will be calculated, in minutes, since the mucosal incision until the endoscopic closure of the mucosal entry with the last endoscopic clip. The average duration of the procedure in the Short-POEM group will be compared wth the dureation of the procedures in the Long-POEM-groups Quality of life [ Time Frame: baseline, 6 months and 2 years ] Improvement of quality of life after Short-POEM compared to Long-POEM, assessed by using the SF-36 questionnaires' scores The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health Eligibility Criteria Go to  Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Recruitment status was  Recruiting First received: October 27, 2010 Last updated: October 27, 2010 Last verified: October 2010 How to Read a Study Record   Purpose Numerous clinical and experimental data show that the elective treatment of diabetic nephropathy should be based on drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Albuminuria is a marker of risk not only renal but also cardiovascular and diabetic patients with concomitant non-diabetic nephropathy, on the other hand, drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system available so far, namely ACE inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists II have proven effective in reducing proteinuria in power even if different therapeutic drug to drug. ACE inhibitors are one of the most known and used treatment options for blocking the renin-angiotensin system in patients with microalbuminuria. Drugs such as enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril are standard therapy in diabetic patients with micro or macroalbuminuria. However, it is still unclear whether their efficacy is, from this point of view, the same or varies from drug to drug. This is particularly true in the diabetic microalbuminuria, a condition in which there is sufficient documentation to prove that ramipril is effective. The main objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and trend of the time and to the antiproteinuric effect of antihypertensive 10-20mg/die imidapril versus ramipril 5-10 mg / day in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.

Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards). Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) incidents reported between the two groups [ Time Frame: 3 years ] Collection of all non-fatal MI's reported between the two groups will use the log rank test for comparison of outcomes. Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards). MI definition follows universal criteria for Types 1-5 MI events. Specifically, the use of the ""Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction"" detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values, with at least one value >99th percentile upper reference limit and preferred biomarker is Cardiac troponin (cTn).

HAE control score is evaluated as frequency of answers [very often, often, sometimes, seldom, not at all] to the following questions at record closest to enrollment date): 1. In the last 3 months, how often have you had angioedema? 2. In the last 3 months, how much has your quality of life been affected by angioedema? 3. In the last 3 months, how much has the unpredictability of your angioedema bothered you? 4. In the last 3 months, how well has your angioedema been controlled by your therapy? Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) Score [ Time Frame: From enrollment up to 36 months (every 3 months) ] The AE-QoL is developed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment in participants with recurrent angioedema. It is a self-administered PRO designed for adults aged 18 years and older with a recall period of 4 weeks. There are 17 items across 4 domains: functioning (4 items), fatigue/mood (5 items), fears/shame (6 items), and food (2 items). Responses use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'never' to 'very often.' Global scores range from 0 to 100 and scores by domains range from 0 to 100. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health (WPAI:GH) Score [ Time Frame: From enrollment up to 36 months (every 3 months) ] The WPAI:GH is a generic questionnaire to measure the effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities during the past 7 days. It can be self- or interviewer-administered to adults aged 16 years or older. This 6-item PRO covers work (5 items) and daily activities (1 item) using yes/no or numerical answers (number of hours). WPAI:GH outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages. An overall work productivity score (health or symptom) [%0WP], is calculated by multiplying the percentage of work time spent working (health or symptom) [% WTW] by the percentage productivity at work (health or symptom) [%PW]: %0WP = %WTW * %PW. Treatment Satisfaction (TSQM-9) Score [ Time Frame: From enrollment up to 36 months (every 3 months) ] The TSQM is a generic questionnaire to measure participants' satisfaction with medication using yes/no and 5- or 7- point Likert scale response options. It is a self-administered PRO designed for adults aged 18 years or older with a recall period of 2 to 3 weeks, or since the last medication use. Version TSQM-9 includes 3 domains: effectiveness (3 items), convenience (3 items), and global satisfaction scale (3 items). Scores range from 0 to 100.

Preoperative management generally includes clinical evaluation, collection of a pathological sample, most often through fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and imaging. FNAC, despite its high sensitivity and specificity, has the drawback of an approximately 20 per cent rate of nondiagnostic or indeterminate result. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides the best morphological description of the lesion, which is helpful to the surgeon for the planning of the intervention. Recently, advanced functional techniques have been introduced, in association to the conventional morphologic ones: diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCEI) demonstrated the ability to provide information about the possible histological origin of parotid lesions. Multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) comes from the combination of anatomical and functional sequences. The Authors postulate that mp-MRI evaluation may be able to provide information not only about the extension of the lesion, but also about histology, with a high accuracy, at least comparable to ultrasound-guided FNAC. In the present study, the Authors aim to define the value of FNAC and mp-MRI in the preoperative management of parotid gland tumors, comparing their success intended as the capability of the exam to be both diagnostic and accurate in formulating the correct histological suspect of malignancy. Participants are patients affected by parotid gland neoplasms, candidates for surgical resection. The lesion will preoperatively be assessed with both clinical evaluation, ultrasound-guided FNAC and mp-MRI in our Institution. Mp-MRI includes conventional sequences, DWI and DCEI; its interpretation will allow the definition of the suspect histology. FNAC and mp-MRI suspects will be compared to the final histopathological report after surgical removal of the neoplasm. The study considers a total of 100 patients, of whom 50 are analyzed retrospectively (being already operated after obtaining both FNAC and mp-MRI preoperatively) and the remaining 50 to be enrolled prospectively.

Increased levels of these two enzymes (amylase and lipase) are associated with acute inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis). In humans treated with GLP-1 (receptor agonist) there have not been found an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Animal and cell studies have shown that the increased levels of amylase and lipase in the blood are not due to an inflammatory state but adaptive changes (volume increase) of the pancreas. The investigators (professor Jens Juul Holst, professor Sten Madsbad) want to investigate whether the increased levels of amylase and lipase in the blood of individuals treated with the GLP-1 analogue Saxenda are due adaptive changes of the pancreas. This will be achieved by measuring amylase and lipase before, during and after treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and at the same time use advanced scanning equipment (PET-MR) from the Clinical Physiological and Nuclear Medical Department at Rigshospitalet, which can determine any volumetric changes in the pancreas with high reproducibility. The scan will be centered on the pancreas, other organs are not evaluated why the study is not designed to detect any malignant findings in the pancreas or other organs. Condition or disease

It is prevalent in western countries, affecting approximately 70% of individuals by the age of 80 (3,4). The risk of acquiring diverticular disease increases uniformly with age, with approximately 40% of people aged over 60 years affected in western countries. Diverticular complications may be severe and include pain, inflammation, infection and bleeding. Although the majority of people with diverticular disease are asymptomatic, approximately 25% will experience an episode of acute diverticulitis (the principal inflammatory complication of diverticulosis); of these, 15% will develop other significant and often serious complications such as abscess, fistula or perforation (3,8-10). King's College Hospital operates a tertiary referral service for patients with diverticular disease that integrates a gastroenterological and colorectal surgical approach to treatment. We increasingly find that many patients have characteristic DD pain and IBS like symptoms with or without a clearly defined episode of diverticulitis. The link between symptomatic diverticular disease and Irritable Bowel Symptoms is reflected to some extent in the literature, however, it remains a matter of significant controversy (11,12). Nevertheless, these symptoms are often difficult to control and can be debilitating. Current treatment options for the IBS like symptoms in symptomatic uncomplicated DD are limited. In this age group, a low FODMAP diet, the mainstay treatment for IBS, is impractical and there are few if any controlled studies that address these issues. There is hence a need for alternative therapeutic options. Secondly, complications related to DD are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and comes at significant cost to the health service (13,14). At present there is no proven prophylactic intervention to prevent the complications. We have recently published the results of a feasibility study carried out at King's College Hospital, which assessed the effectiveness of elective endoscopic clipping of diverticula in patients with a history of significant diverticular bleeding. Here, all visible diverticula were closed endoscopically using 'Instinct' endoclips. We demonstrated a diverticula closure rate of 87.2% (129/148) at follow up colonoscopy. In this group, there were no post-procedural complications and no diverticula-associated symptoms reported up to the follow-up colonoscopy (15). Notably, incidental complete resolution of chronic left sided abdominal pain was noted in one of our subjects. We now propose the use of elective diverticular clipping in patients with symptomatic diverticulosis with a view to alter the natural history of the disease i.e. to prevent complications of the disease. At the same time we wish to assess their symptomatic response. Patients with symptomatic diverticular disease will be eligible. The trial will be carried out at King's College Hospital endoscopy suite, a tertiary referral centre for endoscopic procedures. The study will include 84 patients. Each patient will be in the study for a period of 12 months. Study Design Go to  Layout table for study information Study Type :

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03999502 First Posted : June 26, 2019 Last Update Posted : June 26, 2019 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Erasme University Hospital Study Description Go to  Brief Summary: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients. However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure. The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Approximately 250 million subjects worldwide and 30 million subjects in the US suffer from GERD. Among the 12 million Americans who suffer from daily heart-burn (the main symptom of GERD) almost 5 million do not respond completely to medications and many more do not want or cannot take medications due to side-effects (1). The goals of treatment in GERD are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis if present, prevent recurrence of symptoms and esophagitis, and prevent complications. Medical acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) heals esophagitis, relieves symptoms and improves quality of life. However, acid suppressive therapy does not correct the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter and hence symptoms of reflux due to weakly acidic or non-acid reflux persist in the majority of subjects who present with symptoms persisting on PPIs (regurgitations) (2). Abnormalities in the structure and function of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) such as a permanently open EGJ, a hiatal hernia, a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and transient LES relaxations (t-LESR) are the main pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to GERD (3). Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients (4,5). However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure (6,7). The results reported from operations performed in community hospital lower volume centers have been different than those achieved in centers of excellence. It has been reported that between 23% and 62% of patients who have undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication use acid suppression medications at long-term follow-up. Due to these issues patient and physician acceptance of surgical procedures remains low and is mainly limited to patients with severe GERD or those non-responsive to medications. For these reasons, less invasive endoscopic techniques to treat GERD have been developed during the last 2 decades, which may be categorized into 3 groups: (1) sewing/plication at the cardia and EGJ, (2) radiofrequency (RF) thermal therapy to the LES, and (3) injection/implantation of biopolymers at the EGJ. Minimally invasive endoluminal procedures for GERD are designed to provide long-lasting symptom relief and abolish or lessen medication dependency. Most endoluminal modalities that were introduced into clinical practice have failed due to lack of long-term efficacy, complications, or interruption of commercialization due to financial difficulties of the companies that developed the techniques (8,9). Endoscopic sewing/plication techniques comprised mucosal plications (Endocinch) that were not clinically useful because the plications were not durable, and full-thickness (serosa-to-serosa) plications allowing prolonged durability (NDO Plicator device and Esophyx device). The data from the RCTs with Plicator device were encouraging and the finding of better results with multiple plications without an increase in adverse events supported that this device could have clinical utility. However, the company ceased operations in 2008 and the device is no longer clinically available (10). Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) using Esophyx showed promising results in open studies (11). However, long-term follow-up revealed that a majority of patients required either ongoing PPI use or were referred for LNF owing to persistent symptoms (12). Endomina-v2 (Endo Tools Therapeutics SA, Rue Auguste Piccard 48, 6041 GOSSELIES, Belgium) is a CE marked device that can be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows manipulation of angulated tools during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibility to perform transoral surgical full thickness sutures and transoral endoscopic gastroplasty has shown to be safe and effective at mid-term follow-up in obese patients (13). The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use.

Other: Analysis of gastric juice Analysis of gastric juice including routine, biochemical and microbiological analysis. Other Name: Routine,biochemical, microbiological analysis Detailed Description: Functional dyspepsia (FD) and acid/bile reflux disease are common. These diseases share similar clinical manifestations. Individuals with functional dyspepsia (FD) often present upper abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, early satiety, loss of appetite, and no organic factors underlie it. Individuals suffering from acid/bile reflux disease often complain heartburn, upper abdominal burning or discomfort. What is more, there are always no specific changes on traditional endoscopy that can be used to differentiate these diseases (except erosive esophagitis). Though proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test is frequently applied to confirm the diagnosis of acid reflux disease, but certain amounts of individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not show favorable response to PPI test. In order to make a distinction of these diseases, esophageal pH-metry is needed, however it is not always available in most clinics. Recent data showed that new endoscopic technology such as Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging could demonstrate indistinct lesions caused by GERD which are not detectable by standard endoscopy, subsequently improve endoscopic diagnosis of these diseases. In addition, simultaneous analysis of gastric juice can help to determine whether bile reflux is present or not. As it is known, pathologic refluxes underlie not functional dyspepsia but acid/bile reflux disease. Hence, it is hypothesized that Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging in combination with simultaneous analysis of gastric juice could be used to differentiate functional dyspepsia from acid/bile reflux disease.   Eligibility 18 Years to 75 Years Genders Eligible for Study:

Israel) in patients with esophageal or extra-esophageal gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related symptoms. The end of the study will be at the end of the 6-year follow-up of the last patient enrolled. The study proposes the following objectives: Primary objective: to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic fundoplication with MUSE for the treatment of GERD, through clinical experience, in terms of: effect on GERD-Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) questionnaire scores effect on the use and dosage of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) feasibility and safety of the endoluminal fundoplication procedure Secondary objective: to characterize the treated patient population (demographic and objective data) and to identify the successful predictors of the procedure. The study design includes the following phases: *Preliminary patient evaluation and verification of inclusion criteria through: Upper GI endoscopy Esophageal high-resolution manometry 24-hours esophageal pH-impedance OFF PPI PPI use GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI 6-month follow-up: Upper GI endoscopy Esophageal high-resolution manometry 24-hours esophageal pH-impedance OFF PPI PPI use GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI 12-months follow-up: Upper GI endoscopy 24-hours esophageal pH-impedance OFF PPI PPI use GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI Yearly clinical follow-up (up to 6 years): PPI use GERD-HRQL and RSI questionnaires scores OFF PPI Condition or disease Study Design Go to  Clinical Application of MUSE System for Ultrasound-guided Endoscopic Fundoplication for Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease Patients Actual Study Start Date : Groups and Cohorts Go to  Device: Endoscopic fundoplication Endoscopic fundoplication is a less invasive alternative to the traditional surgical fundoplication. The MUSE device is similar to an endoscope, so the whole procedure can be done by a single operator. The device is composed of a shaft with a distal rigid part which is placed in the esophagus 3 cm proximal to the esophago-gastric junction containing a cartridge holding five B-shaped titanium surgical Staples and a tip which is retroflexed and contains an ultrasonic transducer which defines the correct tissue thickness for stapling the fundus against the esophagus. The device must be extracted to be reloaded with 5 more staples at a time for creation of a 180° anterior fundoplication.

Behavioral disturbances are a major source of caregiver burden and an important contributor to the decision to admit AD patients to institutionalized long-term care. Among the innovative approaches, rocking chair therapy has been introduced as a potential means for reducing agitation in elderly with dementia. Only few studies evaluated the effect of this therapy on the behavioral symptoms in elderly with cognitive impairment. The results were promising, but not sufficiently significant. We propose to perform this study having as a main goal to evaluate the effect of the rocking chair therapy in agitation for home care residents with dementia. The secondary aim of the study will be the evaluation of psychoactive drugs use as well as pain killers. Cohen Mansfield agitation inventory will be employed for the pre- and post-therapy evaluation. Included subjects will be installed in groups of five, rocking chairs will be placed away from other residents in a semicircle in a corner of the dayroom. The therapy sessions will be held every afternoon, for two hours, under the supervision of the unit psychologist and a master's degree psychology student. During the daily session, each resident should be encouraged to actively rock to reach the goal of 60 minutes of rocking accumulated per day. The total duration of the therapy period will be 6 weeks. The use of pharmacological restraint (neuroleptics, anxiolytics) and pain killers will be evaluated before, during and after the six weeks therapy. The expected outcome is a reduction of agitation among elderly with dementia, as well as a reduction in the use of pharmacological restraint and pain killers. Condition or disease

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03442322 Recruitment Status : Not yet recruiting First Posted : February 22, 2018 Last Update Posted : February 22, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Natalie Leland, University of Pittsburgh Study Details Study Description Go to  Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Of the 1.4 million nursing home (NH) residents in long term care facilities, more than half have Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Due to changes in their familiar daily routines, difficulty expressing their thoughts or asking for what they need, and overstimulation (such as noise) or under stimulation (such as lack of activity), individuals with dementia often display disruptive behaviors like resisting help or continually repeating the same phrases. Medications are often prescribed to reduce agitation and aggressive behavior; however, these medications may not be effective and can have a negative impact on the individual. Therefore, families and other stakeholders strongly advocate the use of other types of approaches that focus on minimizing the cause of the behavior. Two facility-based methodologies include the transdisciplinary approach for integrated dementia care, which combines the expertise of all NH staff, who work together to build a common language and approach for each resident, and the multidisciplinary approach for problem-based dementia care, in which each staff member conducts individual assessments and makes discipline-specific recommendations. While prior research suggests that both of these facility-based approaches are useful, the circumstances under which each approach is most effective are not clear. This project will prospectively randomize 80 nursing homes to one of the two treatment arms to compare the effect of the transdisciplinary approach versus the multidisciplinary approach. This study will examine the difference between the two comparators with respect to facility rates of medications dispensed to residents with dementia, leading to enhanced quality of life for the resident. This project is important because it will address a key clinical dilemma NH staff face as they strive to optimize the use of alternative approaches to reduce disruptive behaviors in residents with dementia. Transforming the quality of dementia care in NHs and enhancing the quality of life of residents with dementia are high priorities for families and other advocates. Condition or disease

The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, the PSQI is intended to be a standardized sleep questionnaire for clinicians and researchers to use with ease and is used for multiple populations. The questionnaire has been used in many settings, including research and clinical activities, and has been used in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Clinical studies have found the PSQI to be reliable and valid in the assessment of sleep problems to some degree, but more so with self-reported sleep problems and depression-related symptoms than actigraphic measures. Other Name: PSQI Behavioral: Sleep diary A sleep diary is a record of a patient's sleep patterns and habits that can be extremely useful in helping doctors make a diagnosis of a sleep disorder and better determine if a sleep study should be prescribed. Behavioral: Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living Katz Activities of Daily Living is a validated tool to assess functional status as a measurement of the elder's ability to perform activities of daily living independently. Elders are scored yes/no for independence in each of six functions. A score of 6 indicates full function, 4 indicates moderate impairment, and 2 or less implies severe functional impairment. Other Name: Katz ADL Behavioral: Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Lawton's Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale was developed to assess more complex activities (termed ""instrumental activities of daily living"") necessary for functioning in community settings (e.g., shopping, cooking, managing finances). The capacity to handle these complex functions normally is lost before basic ""activities of daily living"" which are measured by Activities of Daily Living scales. Therefore, assessing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living may identify incipient decline in older adults who are otherwise capable and healthy.The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes to administer. It contains 8 items that are rated with a summary score from 0 (low functioning) to 8 (high functioning). This scale can be administered through an interview or by a written questionnaire. The patient or a caregiver who is familiar with the patient can provide the answers. Other Name: IADL Behavioral: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (Cummings) Neuropsychiatric Inventory is submitted to the caregiver, if the patient has a Mini Mental State Examination score between 10 and 20. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was developed by Cummings et al. (1994) to assess dementia-related behavioral symptoms which they felt other measures did not sufficiently address. The NPI originally examined 10 sub-domains of behavioral functioning: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor activity. Two more sub-domains have been added since its development: night-time behavioral disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities (Cummings, 1997). This wide variety of domains means that, unlike other dementia measures, the NPI is able to screen for multiple types of dementia, not just Alzheimer's Disease. Other Name: NPI Behavioral: Mini Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale, for the caregiver Mini Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale, for the caregiver, if the patient has a Mini Mental State Examination score between 10 and 20. Behavioral: Mini Mental state examination It is an 11-question tool to evaluate cognitive functions. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. The Mini Mental state examination takes only 5-10 minutes to administer and is therefore practical to use repeatedly and routinely. The MMSE has been validated and extensively used in both clinical practice and research, since its creation in 1975 Other Name: MMSE Behavioral: Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia The Cornell scale For Depression in Dementia is a scoring system specifically developed to assess signs and symptoms of major depression in patients with dementia. The 19 parameters measured are clustered into five groups: mood-related signs, behavioural disturbances, physical signs, cyclic functions and ideational disturbances. The Cornell scale For Depression in Dementia has been shown to be sensitive, reliable and valid for assessing depression in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Behavioral: Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease The Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease is a brief, 13-item measure designed specifically to obtain a rating of the patient's Quality of Life from both the patient and the caregiver. It was developed for individuals with dementia, based on patient, caregiver, and expert input, to maximize construct validity, and to ensure that the measure focuses on quality of life domains thought to be important in cognitively impaired older adults. It uses simple and straightforward language and responses & includes assessments of the individual's relationships with friends and family, concerns about finances, physical condition, mood, and an overall assessment of life quality Other Name: QOL-AD Outcome Measures Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Primary Outcome Measures : Evaluation of the benefits of individualized advice administration on sleep quality for the elderly living at home and complaining about their sleep [ Time Frame: Through study completion, an average of 6 months ] Evolution of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

Impact of a specific follow up on quality of life of elderly complaining about their sleep [ Time Frame: Through study completion, an average of 6 months ] Evolution of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory uses a structured, caregiver-based interview format to assess 10 behavioral domains (Delusions, Hallucinations, Agitation, Dysphoria, Anxiety, Apathy, Irritability, Euphoria, Disinhibition, and Aberrant motor behavior). Two additional domains (Nighttime behavioral disturbance, and Appetite/weight changes) are often added. The presence of problematic behaviors in each domain is assessed by asking an informant a screening question followed by a series of yes/no questions. The caregiver or surrogate reporter is then asked to rate the frequency of occurrence of that domain of behaviors. The same behaviors are then rated on level of severity (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The domain total score is the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score for that behavioral domain. A Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score is obtained by summing all the individual domain total scores.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03768830 Recruitment Status : Enrolling by invitation First Posted : December 7, 2018 Last Update Posted : December 7, 2018 Sponsor: Information provided by (Responsible Party): Tanja Grubic Kezele, University of Rijeka Study Details Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) struggle on a daily basis with accompanying, ""Invisible"" symptoms like primary fatigue, pain and emotional-cognitive disorders. With the disease progression, these symptoms only intensify, and in combination with basic physical symptoms, quality of life (QOL) rapidly decreases. An important goal of researchers and clinicians involves improving the QOL of individuals with MS, and the exercise therapy represents potentially modifiable behavior that positively impacts on pathogenesis of MS and these ""Invisible"" symptoms, thus improving the QOL. However, the main barrier for its application is low motivational level that MS patients experience due to fatigue with adjacent reduced exercise tolerability and mobility, and muscle weakness. Getting individuals with MS motivated to engage in continuous physical activity may be particularly difficult and challenging, especially those with severe disability or Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS 6-8). Till now, researchers have focused their attention mainly on the moderate or vigorous intensity of exercise and on cardiorespiratory training in MS patients to achieve improvements in daily life quality, less indicating the exercise content, and most importantly, breathing exercises. In addition, it is investigators intention to make exercise for MS patients more applicable and accessible, motivational and easier, but most important, productive. Investigators think that MS patients experience more stress with aerobic exercise or moderate to high intensity program exercise, and can hardly keep continuum including endurance exercise, or treadmill. Hypothesis: Investigators hypothesis is that 8-weeks of continuous low demanding or mild exercise program with the accent on breathing exercise can attenuate primary fatigue, pain, headaches, emotional-cognitive and sleep dysfunctions in MS patients and provide maintenance of exercise motivation. Investigators also propose that important assistant factor for final goal achievement is social and mental support of the exercise group (EDSS from 0-8) led by a physiotherapist. This will help to maintain exercise motivation and finally make better psychophysical functioning, and thus better QOL.

Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Change of fatigue intensity [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Fatigue estimation using the ""Modified Fatigue Impact Scale"" (MFIS) questionnaire. This test gives an assessment of tiredness effects on physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning and can therefore be treated as 3 separate categories. In full-time MFIS consists of 21 questions. The time to complete is 5-10 minutes and the examinee can solve the test without the help of an interviewer. The total points are obtained by summing all the answers or the additions are made separately by the mentioned categories. Change of pain intensity [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Assessment of pain level using a ""Visual Analogue Scale"" (VAS) for pain. It is a psychometric response scale or a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics that cannot be directly measured. Here, the participants state their degree of agreement with the facial expression shown with the description of the pain in words, including the appropriate number below the image. The VAS for pain is 5 units long, 0 to 5 (0-no pain and 5-hardest possible pain). Change in quality of life [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of Quality of Life using the abbreviated version of the ""36-Item Short Form Survey"" (36-SF) including physical function, role of constraints due to physical problems, physical pain, general health perception, energy level, social function, the role of limitations due to psychological problems and general mental health. Change in headache intensity - HIT-6 [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of headache and its impact on everyday life using HIT-6 questionnaire. The score is obtained from simple summation of the six items and ranges between 36 and 78, with larger scores reflecting greater impact. Change in anxiety symptoms - STAI [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of anxiety symptoms using STAI questionnaire. It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety and to distinguish it from depressive syndromes. It also is often used in research as an indicator of caregiver distress. Form Y has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. State anxiety items include: ""I am tense; I am worried"" and ""I feel calm; I feel secure."" Trait anxiety items include: ""I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter"" and ""I am content; I am a steady person."" All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e. g., from ""Almost Never"" to ""Almost Always""). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. Change in sleeping quality - ISI [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of sleeping quality using ISI questionnaire. The test is designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia and it consists of 7 items: Severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning wakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, notice ability of sleep problems by others, distress caused by the sleep difficulties. Change in headache intensity - MIDAS [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of headache and its impact on everyday life using MIDAS questionnaire. The questionnaire measures the impact of headaches on everyday life and consists a 7-items (with 5 scored items). Change in anxiety symptoms - BAI [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of anxiety symptoms using BAI questionnaire. The inventory contains 21 items rated from 0 to 3 by the taker, with a total possible score of 63 points. Each item is descriptive of subjective, somatic, or panic-related symptoms of anxiety. The items are experiences related to anxiety such as ""Fear of worst happening"" or ""Heart pounding/racing"". The BAI scores are classified as minimal anxiety (0 to 7), mild anxiety (8 to 15), moderate anxiety (16 to 25), and severe anxiety (30 to 63). Change in depression symptoms [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of depression symptoms using BDI questionnaire. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression.The BDI test includes a four-point scale ranging which ranges from 0 (symptom not present) to 3 (symptom very intense). Change in sleeping quality - PSQI [ Time Frame: baseline, up to 8 weeks ] Evaluation of sleeping quality using PSQI questionnaire. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates ""poor"" from ""good"" sleep quality by measuring 7 areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Secondary Outcome Measures : Motivation evaluation [ Time Frame: up 8 weeks ] Survey made from questions for subjective self-evaluation of motivation efficiency. Mental state evaluation [ Time Frame: baseline ] Assessment of cognitive ability using the ""Mini-Mental State Examination"" test (MMSE). MMSE method includes 11 questions that examine five areas of cognitive function: orientation, acceptance of information, attention and information processing, memory and understanding of language. The highest score is 30. The score of 23 or below indicates cognitive impairment.

Of note, this is a pilot trial for feasibility and acceptability. There is no randomization and we are not comparing arms. Behavioral: Distress Tolerance - Benzodiazepine Discontinuation (DT-BD) Distress Tolerance - Benzodiazepine Discontinuation (DT-BD) is a psychosocial intervention. It is paired with a benzodiazepine taper. The aim of the psychosocial intervention is to improve individuals' ability to tolerate distress in order to assist benzodiazepine discontinuation in patients treated with OAT. There will be 3 sessions between therapist and participant prior to the start of the benzodiazepine taper. The taper for both the intervention and control conditions occurs over 9 weeks and involves weekly meetings with a benzodiazepine prescriber during which a gradual benzodiazepine dose reduction will take place. The DT-BD intervention combines elements of existing psychosocial interventions. Specifically, interoceptive exposure techniques will be paired with elements of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and relapse prevention (RP). Drug: BZD discontinuation protocol All participants will undergo BZD discontinuation. Once the starting BZD dose is determined by prescription monitoring and/or self-report, we will maintain participants on this dose until the start of the BZD taper. Participants will see a study physician weekly to receive their BZD medication for the week until the taper is completed. BZD discontinuation in this study will consist of a gradual BZD taper in dose over 8 weeks. The taper will be flexible in that the study physician will utilize clinical judgement to lengthen the taper if necessary, depending on the severity of the participant's withdrawal symptoms. Anchor points will be set (33% reduction in dose after 2 weeks, 50% mid-treatment, 100% by week 8) to emphasize the time-limited nature of the taper. Other Name: Benzodiazepine Relaxation Therapy (RT) This psychosocial treatment intervention uses a combination of progressive muscle-relaxation training and psychoeducation about benzodiazepine use in OAT. Of note, this is a pilot trial for feasibility and acceptability. There is no randomization and we are not comparing arms. Behavioral: Relaxation Therapy Relaxation Therapy (RT), has been utilized in previous trials involving anxiety disorders and BZD discontinuation. In addition to providing non-specific support through therapist contact, it provides psychoeducation about BZD use in OAT and progressive muscle relaxation training. The relaxation training includes training and review of progressive muscle-relaxation procedures in session and at home. Drug: BZD discontinuation protocol All participants will undergo BZD discontinuation. Once the starting BZD dose is determined by prescription monitoring and/or self-report, we will maintain participants on this dose until the start of the BZD taper. Participants will see a study physician weekly to receive their BZD medication for the week until the taper is completed. BZD discontinuation in this study will consist of a gradual BZD taper in dose over 8 weeks. The taper will be flexible in that the study physician will utilize clinical judgement to lengthen the taper if necessary, depending on the severity of the participant's withdrawal symptoms. Anchor points will be set (33% reduction in dose after 2 weeks, 50% mid-treatment, 100% by week 8) to emphasize the time-limited nature of the taper. Other Name: Benzodiazepine Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Participant acceptability of the interventions [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Qualitative interview of the participants will be done asking about the content of the interventions, method of delivery, and structure. Feasibility of the interventions [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Feasibility of intervention will be measured through the number of participants recruited and enrolled in the study, number of participants who started the BZD taper, and completed assessment tools. Secondary Outcome Measures : Completion of intervention [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Completion of intervention will be measured through participant attendance of weekly sessions. Participants must attend all 13 sessions (Baseline, 3 weekly therapy sessions prior to taper, and 8 week BZD taper urine/drug screens).

The Timeline Followback (TLFB) is a clinical and research method to obtain quantitative estimates of drug or alcohol use, and change over time. Participants will be asked to retrospectively estimate their BZD use 7 days prior to study visit. We will also monitor BZD use on a daily basis with a mobile phone application. Illicit drug use based on urine drug tests [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Illicit drug use urine tests will screen for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, opiates, oxycodone, fentanyl, cocaine, barbiturates, and methadone. Plus: liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for clonazepam and lorazepam, and fentanyl if fentanyl test (immunoassay) is positive. Illicit drug use based on self-report [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Timeline follow-back will be measured using the 30-day Timeline Followback (TLFB). The Timeline Followback (TLFB) is a clinical and research method to obtain quantitative estimates of drug or alcohol use, and change over time. Participants will be asked to retrospectively estimate their illicit drug use 7 days prior to study visit. We will also monitor illicit drug use on a daily basis with a mobile phone application. Alcohol use based on urine drug tests [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Urine drug tests will include a ethyl glucuronide (EtG) test to detect the presence in the urine of ethyl glucuronide. Alcohol use based on self-report [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Timeline follow-back will be measured using the 30-day Timeline Followback (TLFB). The Timeline Followback (TLFB) is a clinical and research method to obtain quantitative estimates of drug or alcohol use, and change over time. Participants will be asked to retrospectively estimate their alcohol use 7 days prior to study visit. The alcohol adaption includes estimates of 1 standard drink in terms of beer, wine, and hard liquor. We will also monitor alcohol use on a daily basis with a mobile phone application. BZD withdrawal symptoms [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] BZD withdrawal symptoms will be measured using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Benzodiazepines (CIWA-B). The CIWA-B is a 20 item instrument, to assess severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal, including nausea and vomiting, anxiety, tremor, sweating, auditory disturbances, visual disturbances, tactile disturbances, headache, agitation, and clouding of sensorium. Scores range from 0 to 80, with 1-20 mild withdrawal, 21-40 moderate withdrawal, 41-60 severe withdrawal, and 61-80 very severe withdrawal. Anxiety symptoms [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Anxiety symptoms will be measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), a 21 item self report inventory for measuring severity of anxiety. The items probe about common symptoms of anxiety that the participant may have experienced in the past week, including numbness, tingling, sweating, and fear. Each item is scored on a scale value of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The standardized cutoffs are: 0-7: minimal anxiety, 8-15: mild anxiety, 16-25: moderate anxiety, and 26-63: severe anxiety. Depressive symptoms [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Depressive symptoms will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II, a 21 item self report inventory measuring the severity of depression.

Inability to tolerate negative states [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] The Distress Intolerance (DI) Index will be used to assess Inability to tolerate negative states.The index is a 10 item self-report measure designed to assess the inability to tolerate negative states. Items are rated from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) and are summed for a total score, with higher scores indicating greater DI. Inflexibility or experiential avoidance [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II will be used to measure inflexibility or experiential avoidance. It is a 7 item self-report measure of psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance. Each of the 7 items can be rated on a scale of 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) so scores can range from 7 to 49. Higher scores equal greater levels of psychological inflexibility. Fear of anxiety symptoms [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Fear of anxiety symptoms will be assessed by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index. It is a 16 item scale with each item rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much). Scores can range from 0 to 64. Higher scores reflect greater fear of anxiety symptoms. Distress tolerance [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] Distress tolerance will be assessed with the computerized Mirror Tracing Persistence Task (MTPT-C). It is a computerized version of the original Mirror Tracing Persistence Task in which trace multiple progressively difficult polygons, with participants free to terminate at any point. Distress tolerance is measured by the latency in seconds to task termination. Motivation for BZD Use [ Time Frame: 12 weeks ] BZD motivations will be measured using the 12 item BZD Motivation Scale, a self report questionnaire.

Collaborators: Information provided by (Responsible Party): Prof. Isabelle Merckaert, Université Libre de Bruxelles Full Text View How to Read a Study Record   Purpose The end of treatment marks the beginning of a challenging period for breast cancer patients. While this period often provokes a sense of relief, it can also be a source of apprehension and vulnerability regarding the future. Patients may be brought to feel contradictory thoughts and emotions impacting their quality of life such as anxiety linked to uncertainty and fear of cancer recurrence. In order to accompany breast cancer patients during this transition period and to address these emotional difficulties, the Institut Jules Bordet has launched an 8-session psychological multi-component group intervention. Its objective is to bring patients tools and competencies (e.g., hypnosis, treatment of intrusive thoughts, learning to cope with uncertainty, attention reorientation toward positive thoughts) to promote emotion management and well-being. Breast Cancer Emotional Disturbances Emotional Dysfunction Anxiety Depression Fear of Cancer Behavioral: Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy and Hypnosis Study Type: Intervention Model: Crossover Assignment Intervention Model Description: This is a two-armed, randomized, waiting-list controlled trial. Patients who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to two groups: 1) the experimental group (EG) where six patients will receive one individual pre-group session and 8 sessions of group intervention combining cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnosis; and 2) the waiting-list control group (CG) where six patients will receive the same intervention 4 months later. Patients will be assessed at three time points: 1) at baseline (T1), 2) 4 months later (T2), that means just after the intervention for the experimental group (EG) and just before the intervention for the control group (CG), and 3) 4 months later (T3), that means 4 months after the T2 for the experimental group and just after the intervention for the control group (CG). Masking: None (Open Label) Primary Purpose: Supportive Care Official Title: Improving Emotion Regulation at the End of Breast Cancer Treatment: A Randomized Controlled Study Assessing the Impact of a Multi-Component Psychological Group Intervention Resource links provided by NLM: Further study details as provided by Prof. Isabelle Merckaert, Université Libre de Bruxelles: Primary Outcome Measures: Change in Patients' Subjective Emotion Regulation through six 10-cm visual analog scales assessing anxiety, sadness, fear of cancer recurrence, physical fatigue, psychological fatigue, and energy state-levels [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Patients' Subjective Emotion Regulation at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Patients' Subjective Emotion Regulation at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Change in patients' subjective emotion regulation will be examined using the Emotion Regulation Task. Patients are asked to self-report their anxiety, sadness, fear of cancer recurrence, physical fatigue, psychological fatigue, and energy state-levels just after both exposures to anxiety triggers (the Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (MAC)) and the Impact of Cancer questionnaire Version 2 (IOCv2)) and regulation exercises (self-relaxation and induced relaxation) using six 10-cm visual analog scales (VAS; with the extreme left defined as ""not at all"" and the extreme right defined as ""extremely""). VAS are used because such scales have been shown to be appropriate and adequate for the assessment of emotional states (Davey et al., 2007; Wewers & Lowe, 1990). Change in Patients' Objective Emotion Regulation through an ambulatory digital Holter recording heart rate (beats per minute) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Patients' Objective Emotion Regulation at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 monts after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Patients' Objective Emotion Regulation at T3 (4 monts after T2) for the CG ] Change in patients' objective emotion regulation will be examined using the Emotion Regulation Task. Heart rate (beats per minute) is measured throughout the Emotion Regulation Task using an ambulatory digital Holter recorder. Change in Patients' Emotion Regulation in their Everyday Life through an ecological momentary assessment [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Emotion Regulation in their Everyday Life at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Emotion Regulation in their Everyday Life at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Change in patients' emotion regulation in their everyday life will be assessed through an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedure during 7 days. The EMA procedure will allow to observe the evolution of the ratio between positive and negative emotions in patients' everyday life (Fredrickson & Losada, 2005). Change in Patients' Anxiety State through the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) - anxiety subscale and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Anxiety State at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Anxiety State at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Change in patients' emotional state will be assessed in terms of anxiety: Anxiety is assessed by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) - anxiety 7-item ordinal self-report subscale (Duijts et al., 2012 ; Naaman et al., 2009). Each item is scored from 0 to 3. The subscale score ranges from 0 to 21. A subscale score from 0 to 7 is considered as normal, from 8 to 10 as an adaptation disorder, and from 11 to 21 as a mood disorder. Anxiety is also assessed by the 16-item ordinal self-report Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer et al., 1990). Each item is scored from 1 (""not at all typical of me"") to 5 (""very typical of me""). The total scale score ranges from 16 to 80, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of pathological worry. Change in Patients' Depression State through the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Depression State at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Depression State at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Change in patients' emotional state will be assessed in terms of depression: Depression is assessed by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale - depression 7-item ordinal self-report subscale (Duijts et al., 2012 ; Naaman et al., 2009). Each item is scored from 0 to 3. The subscale score ranges from 0 to 21. A subscale score from 0 to 7 is considered as normal, from 8 to 10 as an adaptation disorder, and from 11 to 21 as a mood disorder. Change in Patients' Fear of Cancer Recurrence State through the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Fear of Cancer Recurrence State at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Fear of Cancer Recurrence State at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Change in patients' emotional state will be assessed in terms of fear of cancer recurrence: Fear of cancer recurrence is assessed by the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI). It is a 42-item 5-point ordinal self-report scale including seven subscales: triggers, severity, psychological distress, coping strategies, functioning impairments, insight, and reassurance (Simard & Savard, 2009). A higher score indicates higher levels of fear of cancer recurrence. Secondary Outcome Measures: Change in an adapted Emotion Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) ESAS at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 ESAS at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete a self-report adapted Emotion Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) assessing from 0 to 10 their usual emotional and symptomatic states (i.e., pain, physical fatigue, psychological fatigue, sleeping difficulties, memory disorder, concentration disorder, feeling of discomfort, hot flushes, depression, anxiety, fear of cancer recurrence, and ruminations). Change in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Questionnaire [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) HADS at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 HADS at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - anxiety and depression 14-item ordinal self-report subscales (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). Each item is scored from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 to 42. A total score from 0 to 12 is considered as normal, from 13 to 18 as an adaptation disorder, and from 19 to 42 as a mood disorder. Change in the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) Questionnaire [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) FCRI at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 FCRI at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) (Simard & Savard, 2009). It is a 42-item 5-point ordinal self-report scale including seven subscales: triggers, severity, psychological distress, coping strategies, functioning impairments, insight, and reassurance (Simard & Savard, 2009). A higher score indicates higher levels of fear of cancer recurrence. Change in the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) WBSI at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 WBSI at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI) (Schmidt et al., 2009 ; Wegner & Zanakos, 1994). The WBSI is a 15-item ordinal self-report measure of thought suppression. Each item is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate greater tendencies to suppress thoughts. Change in the Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (MAC) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) MAC at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 MAC at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (MAC) (Watson et al., 1988). The MAC is a 40-item ordinal self-report ordinal measure of five psychological dimensions of mental adjustment in cancer patients (fighting spirit, anxious preoccupation, helpless-hopelessness, fatalism, and avoidance). Each item is scored from 1 (definitely does not apply to me) to 4 (definitely applies to me). Change in Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) PSWQ at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 PSWQ at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the 16-item ordinal self-report Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer et al., 1990). Each item is scored from 1 (""not at all typical of me"") to 5 (""very typical of me""). The total scale score ranges from 16 to 80, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of pathological worry.

The MCQ-30 is a 30-item self-report measure of metacognitive beliefs (beliefs about thinking). The MCQ-30 have five subscales: cognitive confidence, positive beliefs about worry, cognitive self-consciousness, negative beliefs about uncontrollability of thoughts and danger, and beliefs about the need to control thoughts. Each item is scored from 1 (do not agree) to 4 (agree very much). Subscale scores range from 6 to 24, and total scores range from 30 to 120, with higher scores indicating higher levels of unhelpful metacognitions. Change in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) ISI at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 ISI at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Morin et al., 2011). The ISI is a brief 7-item self-report measure of insomnia. A total score from 0 to 7 is considered as no clinically significant insomnia, from 8 to 14 as a subthreshold insomnia, from 15 to 21 as a moderate clinical insomnia, and from 22 to 28 as a severe clinical insomnia. Change in the Impact of Cancer Scale (IOCv2) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) IOCv2 at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 IOCv2 at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the Impact of Cancer Scale (IOCv2) (Zebrack et al., 2006). The IOCv2 is a 37-item self-report measure of the quality of life of long-term cancer survivorship. The IOCv2 consists of two higher-order scales, a Positive Impact Scale and a Negative Impact Scale, each with four subscales: Altruism and empathy, health awareness, meaning of cancer, and positive self-evaluation subscales for the Positive Impact Scale, and appearance concerns, body change concerns, life interferences, and worry subscales for the Negative Impact Scale. The IOCv2 also have three additional subscales measuring employment and relationship impacts. Each item is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). A higher score on a subscale/scale implies stronger endorsement of that content area. Change in the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) CERQ at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 CERQ at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) (Jermann et al., 2006). The CERQ is a 36-item self-report measure of cognitive emotion regulation strategies someone uses after having experienced negative events or situations. The CERQ distinguishes 9 cognitive coping strategie: Self-blame, acceptance, rumination, positive refocusing, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, catastrophizing, and other-blame. Each item is scored from 1 ((almost) never) to 5 (always). The higher the score on a subscale, the more the patient uses this cognitive coping strategy. Change in the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) MFI-20 at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 MFI-20 at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) (Smets et al., 1995). The MFI-20 is a 20-item self-report measure of fatigue which covers the five following dimensions: General fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity. Each item is scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicating greater fatigue. Change in a Life Event Questionnaire [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Life Event Questionnaire at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Life Event Questionnaire at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients will complete a life event questionnaire assessing hours of physical activity practice, hours of sleep, drugs use, cafeine, theine and alcohol intake, psychogical background, and health care use. Change in Ecological Momentary Assessment through the use of a pedometer and a measure of cardio frequency (Garmin vívoactive® HR) [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Heart Rate, Physical Activiy and Sleep Patterns at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Ecological Momentary Assessment at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] Patients are provided with an armband (Garmin vívoactive® HR) to continuously record during nine days (two days of test and seven days of assessment), their heart rate levels, physical activity levels (pedometer and accelerometer) and sleep patterns. Change in Attentional Bias through a dot probe task [ Time Frame: Change from T1 (baseline) Attentional Bias at T2 (4 months after T1) and maintenance at T3 (4 months after T2) for the EG; Change from T2 Attentional Bias at T3 (4 months after T2) for the CG ] The attentional dot probe computer task will provide a dynamic picture of patients' attentional orientation.

Device: Virtual Reality Child will wear and interact with virtual reality headset while waiting for surgery. Other Name: KindVR Subjects will be given the drug Midazolam to help alleviate the pre-operative anxiety. Drug: Midazolam Child will receive Midazolam to help with pre-operative anxiety prior to surgery Other Name: Versed Detailed Description: There are approximately five million pediatric surgeries performed in the United States every year, and approximately 50% of pediatric patients experience significant stress and anxiety before their surgery. High anxiety can result in increased postoperative pain, increased analgesic consumption, and delayed recovery. The perception of pain can have a strong psychological component and can increase if the patient gives the area of injury constant attention. Thus, different distraction techniques have been utilized by pain psychologists to take the patient's attention away from the area of injury. Pharmacological intervention to treat preoperative anxiety in children has its own side-effect profile. Midazolam is a common medication used parentally, nasally, or orally to alleviate preoperative anxiety. However, there are many side-effects that are not always preventable. Reports of 3.8% of patients having paradoxical effects from midazolam have been documented, and delayed emergence is possible in surgeries of short duration. In addition, midazolam can also result in critical events perioperatively, such as airway obstruction and worsened nausea and vomiting. Non-pharmacological interventions could help avoid these complications, however, current studies do not show a viable alternative to a pharmacological interventions. Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that allows individuals to experience a virtual world. VR initially began as a form of entertainment, but it has expanded its application into several other areas. Within the past 10 years, this type of technology has been applied clinically as a method of distraction for medical procedures such as chemotherapy, physical therapy, burn wound changes, and surgery. VR allows the patients to be immersed in an interactive world stimulating sights, sounds, and motion to help enhance the distraction from pain, ultimately reducing anxiety. A small validation study was conducted at the Virtual Reality Medical Center to test the usability and safety in patients with chronic pain. Patients were presented with pleasant relaxing scenes including natural areas like forests, beaches, and mountains, with relaxing and soothing effects to help mimic slowed breathing. Researchers in this study found that the pain distraction virtual environment (VE) was easy to use, had good stereo sound effects, and was immersive and interactive. They also found that patients experienced low levels of fatigue, headache, eyestrain, and nausea when using the VR device. No studies have involved VR in setting of anesthesia induction period and a non-pharmacological intervention for preoperative anxiety. A pilot study conducted by Wiederhold et al, tested 6 chronic pain patients using a head-mounted VR device. All six study participants reported a significant drop in pain while using the natural VE. Similarly, a study from the University of Washington found that children playing VR video games or navigating through a virtual environment while receiving wound care for their burns had lower pain scores than patients who just played video games. Another study conducted by Wiederhold et al., looked at fear and pain before and after dental treatment and found a significant decrease in pain perception and stated anxiety scores in patients using the VR eyeglasses compared to the nonuse group. Based on success in other medical procedures, we propose a study to examine the efficacy and feasibility of using VR during induction of anesthesia to help minimize anxiety, postoperative pain and analgesic use in patients undergoing a tonsillectomy or a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedure.   Eligibility 5 Years to 11 Years   (Child) Sexes Eligible for Study:

The needles are inserted at a depth of 10-30 mm vertically or obliquely into acupoints, on which electrical stimulation with continuous waves with 2 Hz and 100 Hz are delivered for 15 min for each frequency through an electrical acupuncture treatment instrument (Hwarto, SDZ-II). The intensities of stimulation are adjusted to a level at which patients feel most comfortable. Each session lasts for 30 minutes. Other: Electro-acupuncture No Intervention: Usual care group Participants randomized to usual care will continue regular follow up arranged by their visiting physicians in public or private sectors. Current usual care of these patients is limited to symptomatic treatment and dietary advice only during the follow-up session in out-patient clinic until the end of observation period (week 10). Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Change of gallstones (excretion of gallstones confirm by ultrasound) [ Time Frame: Baseline and 10th week ] Change of ultrasound of baseline and 10th week of gallstones for both treatment group and control group patients. Secondary Outcome Measures : Change of Gastrointestinal Quality of Life instrument (GIQOLI) [ Time Frame: Baseline and 10th week ] The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Instrument measures the domain based on symptoms related to gastrointestinal tract disorder. GIQLI has four subscales including symptoms, emotions, physical functions, social functions and an item (item 24) related to ""troubled by medical treatment"". The GIQLI is a 35-item, using a five-point Likert-type scale ""from 4 (most desirable option ) to 0 (least desirable option )"". The total GIQLI score ranged from 0 to 140, is obtained by adding the score of each answer of the 35 items. Patients with higher scores indicate that patients are with higher QOL. This GIQOLI was validated for gallstone diseases patients. The symptom. GIQOLI will be measured at baseline and 10th week. It measured the quality change of life during the observation period. 132 subjects with Liver function test [ Time Frame: Baseline, 5th and 10th week ] 132 subjects with Liver function test to measure the liver function across the trial. Blood sample from the liver function includes the blood test for ALT, AST and ALP. Alaine Transaminase (ALT), Asparate Transaminase (AST) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) are important enzyme to reflect the liver function of the body. The monitoring of the liver function tests are very important that may indicate any potential blockage of biliary tree upon during the expel of the gallstone. Therefore the LTF will be assess on baseline, 5th and 10th week. Clear common bile duct confirm by MRCP [ Time Frame: After 10th week if number of gallstones reduced(confirm by ultrasound) ] Number of participants with clearness of ultrasound image.

Change of EQ-5D [ Time Frame: Baseline, 5th week and 10th week ] EuroQol Group - 5 dimensions, EQ-5D, is a utility measure general health on five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The utility can use to measure the quality of life adjusted life years for economic evaluation.This will be measured at baseline, 5th week and 10th week. It measured the quality change of life during the observation period. Part I of the scale consists of 5 single-item dimensions including: mobility, self care, usual activities. pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Descriptive data from the 5 dimensions of Part I can be used to generate a health-related quality of life profile for the subject. Part II is a visual analogue scale, asking to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. (0) corresponds to "" the worst health you can imagine"", and the highest rate (100) corresponds to ""the best health you can imagine"". Change of SF-6D [ Time Frame: Baseline, 5th week and 10th week ] Short Form - 6 dimensions, SF-6D is a utility measure general health on two dimensions: physical and mental. The utility can use to measure the quality of life adjusted life years for economic evaluation.The symptoms and Health-related quality of life measured by SF-6D will be measured at baseline, 5th week and 10th week. It measured the quality change of life during the observation period. Detail of SF-6D: The SF-6D uses 11 questions from the SF-36 to define the six domains (physical functioning, role limitation, social functioning, pain, mental health, and vitality). Each domain has between four and six levels. The lower the score the more disability while the higher the score the less disability. Descriptive data from the 6 domains can be used to generate a health-related quality of life profile for the subject, ranging from 0-1, 0 is the worst while 1 is the best.The higher the score, the better the quality of life.

Detailed Description: More than half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus develop hypertension, which doubles their risk for cardiovascular disease. Inflammation plays a role in the development of these diseases, and monocytes, a type of white blood cell, may be critical. This study will isolate monocytes from blood samples of patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure who have either high levels of vitamin D or low levels of vitamin D, and determine what their effects are on stimulating production in kidney cells of a hormone that increases blood pressure.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Recruiting - verified September 2017######Assigned Interventions Provider Consented providers with prescriptive privileges will use the clinical decision software - provider portal to manage study patients with uncontrolled hypertension for 6 months. Participants will conduct a baseline face-to-face visit with study patients, access the program daily to check for patient high blood pressure alerts and lab results, conduct virtual visits as needed every 7 - 10 days, track the time and number of patients managed using the program and complete two questionnaires. Other: Clinical Decision Software - provider portal As noted in Arms Patients In a 6 month period, participants with uncontrolled hypertension will attend an initial face-to-face visit with a study provider, monitor their blood pressures 3x/week at home, enter their blood pressure readings manually or digitally into the clinical decision software - patient portal, get up to 4 blood draws, participate into up to 3 virtual visits monthly, and complete a questionnaire. Other: Clinical Decision Software - patient portal As noted in Arms Detailed Description: Current guideline directed medical therapies (GDMT) for hypertension (HTN) endorse a trial and error approach based on drug class. This pilot study will evaluate the efficacy of a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) program to assist providers with delivering a more personalized approach using individual renin-aldosterone levels and the mechanism of action of medications included in GDMT recommendations. Current research suggests underlying mechanisms of HTN can be categorized by renin and aldosterone levels into approximately 50 categories and sub-categories. Timely identification of a patients' category is challenging for clinicians and possibly a contributing factor to the low rates of HTN control reported in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 53%. The overarching goal of this study is to achieve HTN control rates above the 2014 NANES rate in a timely, cost-effective manner by individualizing medication management, thereby reducing the patient risk of stroke, heart and renal disease, and other devastating HTN-related outcomes. Specific aims are: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the CDS software program to assist providers in identifying and matching the underlying mechanisms of HTN with the mechanism of action of antihypertensive medications to achieve better HTN control rates than the 53% reported in the 2014 NHANES data, 2) assess the efficacy of the CDS program across prescribing provider levels (MD/DO, residents, and APRN/PA), and 3) Determine the impact of the CDS program on: a) medication costs, b) provider management time, c), provider and patient satisfaction with and perception of usability and efficacy of the CDS program to manage their blood pressure. This 2-phase, prospective, within-subjects, repeated measures pilot study will enroll up to 20 multi-level providers with prescriptive authority and 160 military beneficiaries with uncontrolled HTN in the Northwest to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and usability of a CDS program to improve blood pressure control over a six-month period.   Eligibility 18 Years and older   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04047407 Recruitment Status : Enrolling by invitation First Posted : August 6, 2019 Last Update Posted : August 6, 2019 Sponsor: Information provided by (Responsible Party): University of Castilla-La Mancha Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Groups and Cohorts Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to investigate the induced-pain characteristics after suprathreshold pressure stimulation at different intensities in fibromyalgia subjects, compared with healthy volunteers. Condition or disease Device: Suprathreshold pain stimulation Detailed Description: Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic painful, non-inflammatory rheumatic disease with a high negative impact on the quality of life, and is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue and generalised hyperalgesia on examination, symptoms that can be the consequence of central sensitization. Despite several methods have successfully addressed this increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system, there is a lack of consensus about how to systematically perform them and those that are more appropriated for different syndromes. Therefore, investigating appropriate simple methods to assess clinical manifestations of central sensitization is relevant in the assessment of fibromyalgia. The present study aims to investigate the pain response after suprathreshols pressure stimulation in fibromyalgia subjects compared with healthy volunteers. Study Design Go to  Layout table for study information Study Type : Pain Response Characteristics to Different Doses of Suprathreshold Pressure Stimulation in Fibromyalgia Subjects Actual Study Start Date : Groups and Cohorts Go to  Fibromyalgia Device: Suprathreshold pain stimulation Suprathreshold pain stimulation will be applied in the infraspinatus muscle (point equidistant between the midpoint of the spine of the scapula, the inferior angle of the scapula and the midpoint of the medial border of the scapula) with a pressure algometer (Force Ten ™, Wagner Instruments, USA). Four suprathreshold pressure stimulations (pressure pain threshold + 20%, +30%, +40% and +50%) will be made for 60 seconds, with a minimum rest of 5 minutes between each stimulation. The sequence of stimulation (ascending or descending) will be randomized. Healthy volunteers Device: Suprathreshold pain stimulation Suprathreshold pain stimulation will be applied in the infraspinatus muscle (point equidistant between the midpoint of the spine of the scapula, the inferior angle of the scapula and the midpoint of the medial border of the scapula) with a pressure algometer (Force Ten ™, Wagner Instruments, USA). Four suprathreshold pressure stimulations (pressure pain threshold + 20%, +30%, +40% and +50%) will be made for 60 seconds, with a minimum rest of 5 minutes between each stimulation. The sequence of stimulation (ascending or descending) will be randomized. Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Referred pain induced area after suprathreshold pressure stimulation [ Time Frame: Inmediately after each stimulation ] After each stimulation (120%, 130%, 140% and 150%), the subject should draw the induced pain area on a digital bodychart using the Navigate Pain application (Navigate Pain, Aalborg University, Denmark). The size of the areas of referred pain will be extracted in pixels. Secondary Outcome Measures : Pain intensity [ Time Frame: Inmediately after each stimulation ] It will be measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100 millimeters in length. The subject has to indicate the level of pain he feels, being 0 the absence of pain and 100 the maximum imaginable. Body regions afected by pain after suprathreshold pressure stimulation [ Time Frame: Inmediately after each stimulation ] The digital body chart will be divided into 15 different regions: (1) posterior head and neck area; (2) supraspinal area; (3) infraspinatus area; (4) posterior shoulder area; (5) back area; (6) posterior arm area; (7) posterior forearm area; (8) posterior hand area; (9) anterior head and neck area; (10) supraclavicular area; (11) chest area; (12) anterior shoulder area; (13) anterior arm area; (14) anterior forearm area; (15) anterior hand area. The total number of body regions afected by pain will be recorded.

Patients often suffer many somatic and psychological symptoms which contributes negative effect on the health- related quality of life, physical performance and physical activity. Recently, the European League Against Rheumatism presented evidence based recommendations for the management of the fibromyalgia. Accordingly, prompt diagnosis and patient education is required for optimal management. A graduated approach with the aim of improving health-related quality of life should be followed. Pharmacotherapy is only recommended for severe pain and sleep disturbances. It should focus ﬁrst on non-pharmacological modalities and the only ""strong for"" evidence-based recommendation was the use of aerobic and strengthening exercise. Aerobic exercise with moderate intensity (60 to 70% of age-adjusted predicted maximum heart rate (maxHR)) with a frequency of two or three times per week for at least 4 to 6 weeks for a reduction of symptoms is recommended in the management of fibromyalgia. Low-intensity aerobic exercise (<50 % maxHR) is founded ineffective. In recent years, high intensity interval training (HIIT) is used as popular instead of moderate intensity continuous exercise training (MICT) in cardiac rehabilitation units. It is found superior to moderate intensity exercise in improving cardiovascular fitness as increases maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). While the moderate intensity continuous aerobic exercise program lasts 30 to 60 minutes, HIIT contains 4-6 cycles of 1-4 minutes with a maximum effort and lasts approximately 20 minutes in total. Therefore, another advantage of HIIT is the need for a shorter time to achieve similar or greater effects compared to MICT. Our hypothesis is that 6 weeks of five weekly sessions of HIIT will show superior effect reducing the impact of fibromyalgia and improving pain degree, functional capacity and health-related quality of life in women with fibromyalgia compared to MICT. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effects of HIIT versus MICT on pain, functional capacity and quality of life in women with fibromyalgia.

Recently, studies suggest that metformin and vildagliptin can reduce cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients with unclear mechanisms. This work aimed to determine the effect of metformin and vildagliptin on diabetic-hypertensive patients. Patients were allocated into four groups: groupI: healthy volunteers, groupII: patients recently diagnosed with their hypertension and diabetes, groupIII: patients treated with captopril (25mg once daily) for their hypertension in addition to metformin (1000mg bid) groupIV: patients treated with captopril (25mg bid) for hypertension in addition to vildagliptin (50mg bid). At the end of the therapeutic period, then total cholesterol, LDL,serum Creatinine level, blood pressure and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in serum will be measured for different groups to estimate the benefits of one drug over the other one in protecting against cardiovascular risks for diabetic hypertensive patients..   Eligibility 40 Years to 60 Years   (Adult) Sexes Eligible for Study:

The identification and management of hypertension among patients with CKD is challenging, owing to the markedly altered patterns and rhythms of blood pressure (BP) during the 24-hour period (i.e., non-dipping status and nocturnal hypertension) and the high prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension in these individuals. Conventional BP recordings obtained in the office are reported to provide inaccurate estimates of the true BP burden assessed using out-of-office BP monitoring techniques. Self-measured BP by the patients themselves at home provides a more accurate estimate of the patient's daytime BP. Similarly to the general hypertensive population, clinical studies support the notion that among people with CKD, home BP monitoring offers several advantages over the conventional office BP recordings in diagnosing hypertension and estimating the associated cardiovascular and renal risk. Compared with office BP, home BP recordings exhibit closer association with indices of target-organ damage, such as left ventricular mass index and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). Moreover, compared with office BP, home BP recordings are stronger predictors of the rate of renal function decline over time and incident end-stage-renal-disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Importantly, home BP recordings were shown to carry stronger value relative to office BP in predicting the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The feasibility of performing repeated home BP monitoring over several days, weeks or months offers the ability to accurately assess alterations in BP levels and responses to antihypertensive therapy in the long-term. Consequently, several randomized controlled studies conducted in the general hypertensive population have provided evidence that home BP monitoring is a simple approach to guide the management of hypertension on a monthly basis. In a meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials (incorporating data from 9,446 hypertensive patients), it was shown that compared with clinic BP-based hypertension management, home BP monitoring was associated with a significantly higher reduction in systolic BP [weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.63 mmHg; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -4.24, -1.02] and in diastolic BP (WMD: -1.68 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.58, -0.79). Implementation of home BP monitoring as a tool to guide the management of hypertension was associated with more frequent reductions in the number of prescribed antihypertensive medications [relative risk (RR): 2.02; 95% CI: 1.32-3.11] and reduced the risk of therapeutic inertia, defined as unchanged antihypertensive regimen despite the presence of uncontrolled hypertension (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.99). In contrast to the accumulated evidence supporting the use of home BP (HBP)-guided management of hypertension in non-CKD populations, the only study to investigate the role of home BP monitoring as a tool to achieve BP targets in patients with CKD was a previous, small, randomized study enrolling 65 ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis. In this study the use of home BP monitoring for 6 months produced a significantly higher reduction in interdialytic ambulatory BP compared to conventional managements of hypertension based on routine pre-dialysis BP recordings (mean 24-hour BP at study-end: 135/76 versus 147/79 mmHg, p<0.05). Despite the fact that the use of home BP monitoring among people with hypertension and CKD is anticipated to overcome the barriers of white coat and masked hypertension effects and improve therapeutic inertia, there is still no solid evidence on the value of using this technique as a simple approach to improve BP control and maximize the associated benefits on regression of target-organ damage.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03999502 First Posted : June 26, 2019 Last Update Posted : June 26, 2019 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Erasme University Hospital Study Description Go to  Brief Summary: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients. However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure. The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Approximately 250 million subjects worldwide and 30 million subjects in the US suffer from GERD. Among the 12 million Americans who suffer from daily heart-burn (the main symptom of GERD) almost 5 million do not respond completely to medications and many more do not want or cannot take medications due to side-effects (1). The goals of treatment in GERD are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis if present, prevent recurrence of symptoms and esophagitis, and prevent complications. Medical acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) heals esophagitis, relieves symptoms and improves quality of life. However, acid suppressive therapy does not correct the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter and hence symptoms of reflux due to weakly acidic or non-acid reflux persist in the majority of subjects who present with symptoms persisting on PPIs (regurgitations) (2). Abnormalities in the structure and function of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) such as a permanently open EGJ, a hiatal hernia, a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and transient LES relaxations (t-LESR) are the main pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to GERD (3). Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients (4,5). However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure (6,7). The results reported from operations performed in community hospital lower volume centers have been different than those achieved in centers of excellence. It has been reported that between 23% and 62% of patients who have undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication use acid suppression medications at long-term follow-up. Due to these issues patient and physician acceptance of surgical procedures remains low and is mainly limited to patients with severe GERD or those non-responsive to medications. For these reasons, less invasive endoscopic techniques to treat GERD have been developed during the last 2 decades, which may be categorized into 3 groups: (1) sewing/plication at the cardia and EGJ, (2) radiofrequency (RF) thermal therapy to the LES, and (3) injection/implantation of biopolymers at the EGJ. Minimally invasive endoluminal procedures for GERD are designed to provide long-lasting symptom relief and abolish or lessen medication dependency. Most endoluminal modalities that were introduced into clinical practice have failed due to lack of long-term efficacy, complications, or interruption of commercialization due to financial difficulties of the companies that developed the techniques (8,9). Endoscopic sewing/plication techniques comprised mucosal plications (Endocinch) that were not clinically useful because the plications were not durable, and full-thickness (serosa-to-serosa) plications allowing prolonged durability (NDO Plicator device and Esophyx device). The data from the RCTs with Plicator device were encouraging and the finding of better results with multiple plications without an increase in adverse events supported that this device could have clinical utility. However, the company ceased operations in 2008 and the device is no longer clinically available (10). Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) using Esophyx showed promising results in open studies (11). However, long-term follow-up revealed that a majority of patients required either ongoing PPI use or were referred for LNF owing to persistent symptoms (12). Endomina-v2 (Endo Tools Therapeutics SA, Rue Auguste Piccard 48, 6041 GOSSELIES, Belgium) is a CE marked device that can be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows manipulation of angulated tools during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibility to perform transoral surgical full thickness sutures and transoral endoscopic gastroplasty has shown to be safe and effective at mid-term follow-up in obese patients (13). The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use.

GERD has become in the last decades a common disease at the occidental world affecting between 10 to 15% of this population. That implies a high socio-health cost and the decline of the quality of life of those patients. The diaphragm muscle surrounds the lower esophageal sphincter, and helps to prevent gastroesophageal reflux. If one or both structures become incompetent, it may appear GERD. Until the moment, the treatment for GERD begins by lifestyle modification, and if it fails, the treatment becomes medical and, in selected cases, surgical. It exists some studies that have demonstrate that diaphragmatic breathing training can have a positive effect in GERD and the need of drug usage. But until the moment, the effects of a myofascial release of the diaphragm haven't been explored on these patients. Thirty patients with GERD referred from different hospitals of Valencia will be randomized into two groups: Intervention with myofascial release for the diaphragm Sham treatment group which is going to receive the same number of session treatments with the same manual techniques, but without the myofascial stimulus The protocol that will be applied consists of 4 identical sessions of myofascial release techniques aimed to normalize the myofascial tension of the diaphragmatic muscle. These sessions will be distributed in two weeks. The study focuses on the analysis of the following variables: Frequency and intensity of the symptoms of GERD: Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) Specific quality of life for gastrointestinal disease: Gastrointestinal Quality of life Index (GIQLI) Drug usage: weekly milligrams usage of proton pomp inhibitors (PPI) The results of these pre-intervention and post-intervention variables will be compared between the two groups at baseline (first session), at week 3 and at week 6.
