The scar has healed, and my dermatologist prescribed Aldara cream to be applied daily for about 3 weeks to a large area on my scalp where there are several actinic keratoses visible (she biopsied them). After 8 hours I wash it off. My concern is about the side effects I keep reading about Aldara. I 've used it for 2 nights in a row now and am already feeling flu like symptoms and have noticed that my occipital lymph node is swollen and tender. Other than some slight itching, I 'm not having much reaction at the site of application. Could the other symptoms be related to the Aldara or have I just been reading too much on the internet?######Hi! Flu-like symptoms, together with headache and muscle pain, are rare side effects while using Aldara. More common are mild local skin reactions such as itching, peeling, burning, rush, pain, erosion and edema at the site of application or surrounding areas. If you experience a severe skin reaction like erosion, you should wash it off and notified your doctor. I 'll suggest you to inform your doctor and ask to decrease the application, because some trials showed that the side effects were more common and more intense with daily use rather than 3 times a week. All best to you!######Thanks for your response. My dermatologist did cut me back to 3 applications per week. I 'm still having the swollen lymph nodes in my neck, but they are worst the day after application. Anyway, she wanted me to continue and said that my body was responding as it should, so I 'll tough it out a couple more weeks!######Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) can be seen in 5% of patients during 6 weeks treatment with Aldara. This sign, together with flu-like symptoms, can be a enough reason to make an interruption of dosing. You should know that you can develop treatment site infection, which can be also reason for swollen lymph nodes. This, also, requires a rest period and antibiotics can be taken. After the interruption or rest period you can continue with your treatment and still have good results from the treatment. You can ask your doctor about the rest period. Please, write me back!######I did see my dermatologist 1 week ago and she seemed pleased with the way the aldara is working. There does n't seem to be any sign of infection at the site of application, (no real pain or swelling) and the flu-like symptoms do n't seem to be quite as severe since I 'm only applying the medication 3 times a week now. I have one week to go, so am hoping that it will all be over soon. I 'll see the doctor again on the 19th for a follow-up. Thanks again for your information! Amy######I had a biopsy yesterday. I was just wondering whaththe aldara is used for.######Aldara is used to treat Actinic Keratosis, Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma and External Genital and Perianal Warts. Have you been suspected for skin cancer? Did you receive your biopsy results?######I 'm happy your feeling much better. Hope you 'll have good results with the treatment. Please, keep me up dated about your condition! All best to you!######I 've been on Aldara for 4 weeks now, 5 days a week with a 2 day rest period. I have BCC on my left cheek and as soon as I start using the Aldara on the site the next morning my lymph node on my left side swells up like a grape and is like that for the duration of the 5 days treatment. Some days I am slightly feverish and achey and quite tired. My cheek looks like something out of a horror film and this skin has scabbed and shed twice, this is my third round of skin growing. The area is very red and swollen, I only hope it does n't leave a scar or that the redness fades away rather than looking like a baboons bottom during mating season. My face has a little indentation, like a crater, hope this heals up. I 'm really fair skinned and never go in the sun which surprises me how I got this in the first place, mind you I live in New Zealand where we have an extremely high rate of skin cancer. All I know is that I 'm glad to become cancer free without stitches and extensive scarring from surgery.######I 'm 44 and had my first skin cancer at 24. Mohs the first time and I HATE MOHS. It always leaves a scar. I 've had many different sites with skin cancer since, but none as bad as the first. I 'm using Aldara as a preventive on my face right now and efudex on my arms. Efudex on your face is really bad, but on the arms not a big deal. Stick with the Aldara. It ca n't be that bad. Plus Aldara and Efudex actually make your skin look better either way.######It IS that bad. I have been using Aldara on my face 2x/week for 8 weeks (plus two weeks off at the third and fifth week's end-- just could n't take it anymore). I look like a burn victim. I have bright red, crusty lesions on my forehead, all around my nose, and above my upper lip. The areas are painful, itchy, and stinging. I feel under the weather (mildly flu-ish) the entire time I 'm on this stuff. I hate Aldara, but I 'm sticking with it because my doctor assures me it is the best way to treat AK without scarring. This is the second time I 've used it, however, and one area near my nose continues to react, so I will need a biopsy there regardless..######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

I 've felt confident with her and am now following up with Aldara cream to treat the actinic keratoses that are also on my scalp.

I have not noticed any change in colour since it changed light brown and there are no bumps, it seems flat. The Doctor has said not to worry about it. Iâ$ ve attached several photos of the blemish, one as it is with wrinkles and the other with the skin stretched flat to show the shape. I wonder if anybody can give a name to this type of blemish and if itâ$ s normal for it to spread over the years. http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff326/c rismyphotos/P6060019a. jpg http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff326/c rismyphotos/P9270018. jpg Thank you######IT looks like your skin is pretty fair, eh? From a little bit of research, it seems that you might be experiencing actinic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses. During this skin condition, small rough or scaly areas of skin appear due to damage from sun exposure. Some actinic keratoses can turn into squamous cell skin cancer, so it is important to perform self-examinations often and catch them early. You might also want to insist on seeing a skin specialist. A dermatologist is better qualified to diagnose the lesion and to decide if a lesion should be biopsied or treated.######I have recently started to collect information about this blemish and inevitable skin cancer keeps cropping up. Iâ$ ve looked at actinic keratoses; I donâ$ t think my blemish is scaly, it may look like that because of the deep wrinkles and it doesnâ$ t feel rough (as sandpaper) but is quite smooth like the surrounding skin when I stretch the skin. I agree the advice to regular monitor the blemish; during my reading the idea of taking digital photos is also good. The doctor did look closely and didnâ$ t see cause for concern; but I think later I will press for a dermatologist to have a look. I may even arrange to see a local clinic about non surgical cosmetic applications to temporary hide the blemish, itâ$ s in rather a prominent place and their dermatologist may also be able to give me a definite name for the blemish.######Sounds like a plan. Please let us know what the dermatologist says. I 'd be interested to see if s/he can help you with temporary cover up and longer term diagnosis..######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

I have a fair complexion and do not stay out in the sun. But I have had skin cancer before, years ago. I think this is the third time I have gotten it. My skin cancer is pink colored and perhaps a little flaky. It 's only a small one of about 3/16 '' round shaped and is on my forearm. I have read that there are basically three types of skin cancer. But there are other names under those three common types. According to what I saw from looking at various pictures of skin cancers, it looks like actinic keratoses. But a description of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) sounds like that could also be a possibility. But mine is real light colored and looks pinkish like the photo I saw of actinic keratoses. I hate to go to doctors and I think this can be treated with drugs since I have used them in the past for skin cancer. I do n't remember the name of the med I used then. It was prescription. I think it was like a white cream that you just rub into the skin. Has anyone used any natural remedies? Not sure if I would depend on something natural like. Maybe my primary care physician can identify it and give me a script, but I would rather avoid seeing a doctor unless it is absolutely necessary. Thanks. Bluehills######You may wish to go to the doctor. You did n't mention what kind of skin cancer you had in the past. In general, there is Basal Cell (harmless) Squamous Cell (can be fatal) Melanoma (always fatal if ignored). There is a rare pink skin cancer, Amelanotic Melanoma that is usually more agressive than the standard darker Melanoma. Efudex 5 &#37; is by rx and is a chemotherapy cream that has been shown to help with small basal cell or squamous cell or residual cancer cells after excission.######djoyv I remember a skin cancer I had probably 15-20 years ago that was about a half inch round, very crusty and it would bleed ocassionally. But I do n't remember the exact name of it. The doctor back then actually cut the thing off my arm. Maybe old technic these days. My second skin cancer I used a cream on it. And I bet it was Efudex 5%. Since I 'm not a doctor it would be premature for me to say it is actinic keratoses, but the pic I saw of it looks exactly like it in early stage. I have a few freckles on my arm and it almost looks like a big freckle but more pinkish in color. It 's almost hard to see really. Thanks for mentioning the Efudex 5% to me. For now I am not in any hurry to have anything done with it. I 'll be keeping an eye on it though to see if it changes in any way. I know some skin cancer can kill. I do see a doctor in 3 weeks.

The doctor ``froze '' what she diagnosed as an AK on my cheek. It blistered and a scab fell off. I go to my follow up appt. next week however the AK now looks exactly the same. I am worried it 's something more than just an AK. Has this happened to anyone and if so what do you think is the next course of action? Will she refreeze it? Is it common for some AKs to be stubborn and not go away with the cryo? Thank you in advance for your replies! Leslie######Hi Laef I had absolutely no idea what AK was when I read your post. I did a search on `dermatology & AK ' & now know that you 're talking about Actinic Keratoses. From what I 've read, there 's several different types of treatment e.g. topical steroids & other types of cream, liquid nitrogen & also some kind of phototherapy. I 'd guess that if your treatment has n't worked, not to worry there 's still several other options. I noticed there 's also an AK Society who might be able to give you lots of info too. I hope you find a successful treatment soon. Best wishes. Lidia######Dear Lidia: Thanks for your reply! Sorry I did n't clarify what an ``AK '' is. . It is my understanding that an Actinic Keratosis is the very earliest form of Squamous Cell Carcinoma. AKs are common and the dermatologist can diagnose them simply by sight. I was just wondering if anyone else has had these removed and I am going to post a separate message regarding that. Thanks again. Leslie.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

Using a form of eggplant extract called BEC5, doctors treated both invasive and non-invasive non-melanoma skin cancers (squamous and basal cells). The results were equal to those resulting from invasive surgery, minus the scars. And doctors concluded: `In our view and experience, BEC5 is... safe and effective... it is a cost-effective treatment for both primary and secondary skin cancer. ' Follow-up research on patients who used BEC5 shows once their cancer went away, usually in 3 months or less, and it did not recur. Over 80,000 patients have used it successfully. Microscopic analysis consistently shows death of all cancer cells. And no cancer has ever returned. BEC5 does not kill any healthy human cells. With microscopic precision, it selects and eliminates only the cancer cells. Healthy cells are not affected in any way by the treatment. It can even be used cosmetically-- to diminish age spots, sun spots and `pre-cancers' called actinic keratoses. The cream made by Curaderm was previously only available in Australia but now has been sold over the internet for 1 year..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

Can anyone tell me if it is normal to still be having problems 8 months after having pneumonia. I went back to my doctors about 2 months ago and she said my chest was clear but I am still getting alot of phlegm. Thanks######HI....... No, I do n't think it is normal for you to still be coughing up phlegm after 8 months. You need to go to a specialist. Is the phlegm white or what color is it? I suppose you know that yellow or green mean infection. Do you have allergies? That would cause phlegm. What does your doc say other than your lungs are clear? My lungs are CLEAR when I am sick too. Find out from a doctor what it is. Make him or her listen to you, ok? Betty######Hello Betty, Thanks for your reply. I do n't think it is normal either, but I have seen two doctors who have both listened to my chest and said there is nothing wrong. I feel that they do n't believe me or that I am just fussing. The phlegm is white so they have said it is n't an infection and that maybe my lungs are a little inflamed after the pneumonia. I think I will just have to go back to them and make them listen to me.

Sounds like you got some nasty type of lung infection that may have casued some breathing problems to linger. I am glad that you are going to see a specialist- he or she will do tests to determine what is happening with you. It does sound like you may be suffering from asthma- possible brought on by the lung infection Also, please treat yourself for Acid Reflux/GERD (from all the Prednisone you had to take, really upsetting to the stomach)- try over the counhter Prilosec or Pepcid XS- stomach/acid problems can make breathing really bad. Also, some of your pain and other symptoms may be Prednisone side effects/withdrawl- please take some time to look into that. Best of luck to you- I hope that you make out well.

It worked and after about 5 days of being on the Z-pak, I was better. However, literally to the day- one month later, I 'm coughing up yellow-green phlegm again, and I 've got a really runny nose and congestion. So, this time, I went to my primary doctor, and he told me he was n't going to put me on antibiotics since I just had a dose a month ago, and he told me to just drink lots of fluids and get rest. BUT, after 2 days since seeing him, I 'm still coughing up yellow-green phlegm and have cold symptoms, but no aches, no fever, and no other malaise... just yellow-green phlegm in my cough and runny nose, sneezing. So, I 'm wondering if this will just go away or if I should revisit the antibiotics route... but... I do n't want to if I do n't have to because I just took them a month ago.

I 'm new to this forum, so here's my 1st post. I am a 55 year old caucasian, non-smoker, in great health, (at least I think so) with allergies to milk. I notice the past several months, every morning I have green phlegm `stuck ' in my throat, and my wife has been complaining thru the day of my `very very bad breath '. She is even saying that our bedroom is `reeking ' with my bad breath smell. A friend at a social get-together also mentioned it (in a kind way, but hey, that concern still hurts!) my dietary habits have been unchanged for years. I take multi-vitamins, etc.. I floss, no gum disease, dentists ca n't find anything wrong, (and yes I clean my tongue). I personally think the bad breath is from my digestive track, as I clear my throat throughout the day, and spit out tiny bits of green phlegm. A doctor placed me on antibiotics (a few months ago) for a cold, but except for the cold healing, my phlegm problem remained. I 've never smoked, breathing is great, and I exercise. I have now been using soy milk the past several months, but still the problem persists. Only very occasionally will I use milk, or creamer for coffee, once a day. Could even that tiny dosage of non-soy be doing me in? Am I just `getting old '? Except for this, I definitely do n't feel `over the hill '! Should I take acidophilus ?? Do n't seem to have any pollen allergies. Gosh... Any advice would be deeply and tremendously appreciated. Thank you, martin######It could be your sinuses... Sinusitis. Often a cold brings it on and it stays even after your cold is gone. Sinusitis can produce green phlegm and bad breath... Something like if you swallow the phlegm, the acid in your digestive track makes it smell it can cause bad breath when it comes up. Sinusitis is treated with a decongestant or antibiotic depending on the severity, but to prevent your sinuses from drying and burning you can inhale steam from a bowl of hot water or the shower a couple times a day. Allergies can also cause post-nasal drip with green phlegm. When phlegm is thick it does n't move around and sticks much more than regular saliva, so it sits there and becomes smelly. Try drinking a lot of water and see if that reduces the bad breath. I 'm no doctor, but these could be some causes of it.######Try the foll. (do n't brush this away as something useless everyone suggests- It may not cure you, but will definitely reduce the intensity). First thing, after you wake up in the morning BEFORE you brush or eat or drink anything, you must drink 4 glasses of water. Repeat at 11.30 am, then by 4.30 pm and then at 7.30 pm. Before going to bed, drink 2 glasses. That amounts to total of 18 glasses. Imp: do not eat or drink anything 40 mins before and after drinking water. After drinking water each time, most probably you will have a temporary runny nose- be sure to blow your nose then. Try this for three days and simultaneously study reactions of people around you. If you find a change for the better, continue water therapy..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders

I went to a mole scanning clinic and they took pictures of it and said nothing to worry about. I do n't think i ' v seen any noticable changes but there could have been small changes and since its on my back its hard to see. 5 Years later, I decided to do a mole checkup, they said that it was suspicious and wanted to watch for it and any changes in 3 months. Anyway, there was a change in color. The mole is about 1-1 .5 cm in diameter. They did a ``shave biospy '' and injected me with a needle and i think they shaved it off. I think it might have been bleeding. The doctor said that she does n't think its a melanoma. She also said ``This is deep enough to remove the mole ''. Anyway 3 days later, she rang in and said after biopsy the mole was a melanoma but it was in its early stages and that i caught it early. I think she said that it was only in the epidemis in a small section. Anyway i went on the internet and find out ``Shave biopsy '' can not determine the stage of the mole as it ca n't give the full depth. Now i 'm thinking she is unqualified and i 'm worried this has spread more than her diagnosis. I guess what i am asking is, can they guarantee that it is ONLY at stage 0 through a shave biopsy? I 'm not asking about identifying which stage it actually is but whether it is stage 0 or something later.######Actually i do n't really know if it was a ``shave Biopsy '' but she did mention ``shaving it off '' And the area has been sore for about 5 days now and she gave a needle to make it numb before she did it. And she also put a bandage and cotton wool over the top of it.######To answer myself. I think she did ``Saucerization '' or a ``deep shave ''. After doing deep searching, i found this type of skin biopsy. My scar looks way too bloody to be a shave biopsy and has taken a week to heal.######I know it is three months later but I did not see this before. A shave biopsy is only a biopsy. Melanoma should be toally removed with a margin of skin to check out. How deep was it. Did you get the biopsy report? Well how are you doing now? How does that area look? I had a big problem with doctor who told me not to worry. Well, eighteen months later I had to have big surgery for area I asked them to check out. It was not okay at all... it was melanoma.######Originally it was a shave biopsy. It had a 1mm depth of skin. But the report said the melanoma was well clear of the margins. 2 Weeks later, They did a full depth excision. I went to a plastic surgeon to do it to be sure. They did a 1cm margin (Skin specimen was 4cm (width) by 2cm (height) by 1.5 cm (depth) but it was n't mohs. The second report (The full excision) said they found a scary wound in the middle of the cut out (From the shave biopsy) and no evidence of any malignancy. I 'm more worried because the first report said it was melanoma in situ but they found lymphocytic regression (This would have been in the top layer of the skin- epidermis as the shave biopsy does n't go far into the dermis). There exact words were ``Active lympohocytic regression in the area ''. Does n't tell me if its extensive or not. No lymph node tests were done. I heard that you can not diagnose a melanoma in situ if it has regression. But then i guess they found nothing in the second report which contained the dermal layer so in therory it should n't have previously made it to the dermal layer and regressed.######What was the Clark level? How dept was the melanoma? How come no one check your sential lymph node? I had a .75 mm on my head. I had a large area (2cm X 2cm) removed from my head and check out and my sential node checked out too. I was told this was the best thing to do. That was two year ago and all is till okay. My friend had it the same time I did. She had it does the shave biopsy way and that 's all. Two months later she had to get it redone. A years later she had it somewhere else. She is not doing good. Call one of the clinic like Mayo or Sloan Keating up and ask them about it. That 's what I did. Jack######Well i has a full excision 3 weeks after shave biopsy diagnosis and they did n't find anything other than the scar from the shave biopsy. They diagnose the clark level as 1. They did n't provide a breslow depth, it just says says small area, Clark level 1 and no dermal invasion with active lymphocytic regression and a very small amount of pagetoid spread. The GP said that the sentinel lymph node test was not necessary. She was saying the melanoma was so small that a breslow was n't even measured. Referring that it was 0.1 something but it did n't say this on the report whether she was right or anything. But i guess you go a sentinel check because it was on your head where there is less skin depth. Mine was on the lower back where there was alot of skin.######Also may i ask, did you friend orginally have a melanoma in situ? or was it larger? What clark level was your melanoma? I think i did n't get a breslow depth because the clark level is independently significant on clark level 1 melanomas.######She had melanoma in situ. No clark level was given to her. My clark level was 3. Breslow depth was .75 mm. My margin was clean and my lymph nodes were okay too. That was two years ago (9/11/07). I was getting a CT every three months for a year and now get one every years with blood work too. I now see a very good dermotagist (spelling bad). I see her every three month. She was busy with my skin problem at first but now she can not find anything on me at all. I keep out of the sun and use blocker every day. I also see a oncologist. Frist very three months now once a year. Are you seeing an oncologist? They know all about this cancer and can help you out. You must have the right doctor to make it thur this. I went to a bad one at first. I try to take him to court but my lawyer settle out of court but he is still in business. There are a lot of bad once out there. Melanoma is a real killer. You must make sure no cells got away. Good luck. Jack######What? How did she have melanoma in situ, but no clark level ?? clark level 1 is suppose to be melanoma in situ, so if they did n't diagnose the clark level how did they know it was melanoma in situ? I ' v been reading up on this, when you have clark level 1, a breslow is not required. However non insitu melanomas require a breslow. Wait, when they reexcised her 2 months after, was it another shave biopsy or a full depth excision? What margin did they use? Sounds to me that when they did the shave biopsy a bit was on the side, then it grew over 2 months then they only excised a situ margin which was not enough by the 2 months had passed. I asked for a 1cm margin with the plastic surgeon even though it was diagnosed as in situ melanoma because i ' v heard reports that 0.5 cm is not enough. Well i 'm gon na get myself a proper dermetalogist to overlook this. I have a GP who is doing this.######She went to the wrong dermatologist. He has a few PA work for him that do all the work. Biopsy which I saw was not a full report and that also is done in the doctor office. Just the wrong doctor. Sorry case but it happen everyday. I was stage 1A. I am seeing two sets of doctor, one not know about the other. Are you seeing a dermatologist and a oncologist too. You say you have a GP was it that? I hope it not a General Practice doctor. Jack######What do you mean the biopsy was not a full report? Did she get a positive deep margin on the shave biopsy or something? I had a shave biopsy but the melanoma was ``well clear of the margins '' as my report says, then they re-excised the melanoma with a 1cm deep wide excision three weeks later and found nothing. Yep, I go to a skin cancer clinic, but they are really just general practitioners specialized in skin cancer, so might be worth getting a dermatologist to double look over things just to be sure over the next few years. I went to a plastic surgeon specializing in melanomas to remove the melanoma and he overlooked the biopsy report and he assured me there was nothing to worry about. However reading over the report, i think its gon na be ok. Do you know from the margin how much they actually do cut out? Is that the margin of how much melanoma cells must be clear of or is it a margin around where the whole mole area was? My original mole was 8mm X 7mm (width & height) in total size, but the reexcision was 40mm X 20mm X 15mm (width & height & depth). When you subtract 7 from 20, you get 13, leaving 13mm of non mole skin from the top to bottom and a radius of 6.5 (if you share it equally)... Does n't that mean 6.5 mm margin ??? However my melanona cells was less than 0.1 mm wide so i guess 20mm makes 10mm each side ???? Is it a margin of the melanoma cells or the mole ????######When they did my operation there was no more cancer left the biopsy was all the cancer I had. I had a 40mm circle removed from my head. Before I had it done I checked out what Mayo and Sloan Keathing would do. They both told me to get it done this way and seeing a Dermatologest and an oncologist was also very important.

This stage is the earliest and most curable, and recurrence and subsequent death, after the local treatment, from melanomas 0.5 mm is a very rare event. The depth of melanoma lesion, also accurately predicted the risk for lymph node metastasis, with deeper tumors being more likely to involve the nodes. Melanoma depth is most accurate when measured by evaluating the entire tumor via an excisional biopsy, instead punched biopsy, which gives less accurate results.######0.5 mm is not in situ. Melanoma which has ANY Breslow thikcness (even 0.1) is already invasive and have stage 1.######I have had melanoma as well, Stage 1A .33 mm. The poster above told you that all .5 mm melanomas are ``in situ '' (Stage 0) that is not correct. Many early Stage 1 tumors that have progressed beyond the epidermis, even slightly, are well below 0.5 mm (my .33 mm for example). Nevertheless, the 10 year survival rate for most studies for a radial growth phase melanoma of less than .75 mm with no regression, ulceration or other negative factors (i.e., high mitotic rate) is very high (depending on the study you look at 95-99%). So you 're clearly in the 95-99% range of not having your cancer recur. Keep in mind those statistics include elderly and immuno-compromised patients so you really do n't have much to worry about and I 'm sure you 'll be fine with such a shallow melanoma. The .5 mm however DOES NOT mean that it is an ``in situ '' lesion. Hope that helps######Clark Level The Clark level refers to how deep the tumor has penetrated into the layers of the skin. This system was originally developed by W. H. Clark, MD back in 1966. Clark levels are officially defined as follows: Level I: confined to the epidermis (top-most layer of skin); called ``in situ '' melanoma; 100% cure rate at this stage You have ``in situ '' or Stage 0. You are lucky you got it early. You will be okay. MandMs know what she is talking about. Be good use sun blocker and do n't get too much sun. Jack############I was diagnosed with Malignant melanoma superficial spreading type, clarks level II, with focal apparent regression 0,55 mm in depth. T1NXMX. they did a re- execision and said they interpreted as residual of malignant melanoma in Situ with Dermal Fibrosis and the margins are free. I am so stressed! I do not want to go out and get exposed to the sun, wha are my changes...######Help, i am a nervous wreck. In 2005 I was found to have Melanoma in-situ on my neck. The dermatologist removed the mole and told me it showed a zero margin but to schedule an appt to come back to cut a little more around the area to make sure all was good. Well... things got hectic and I got pregnant (3X) AND NEVER RETURNED.I went in today to have a full body check, no new moles, and they now want to do the re-incision and test it. I am so scared I have put my life in jeopardy but not following up on this sooner! Even though I showed a zero margin, could cells still be left in and now I have stage 2 +?######Hi and congratulations on the babies... On your question, yes, they can... This is why you were told to do this... Have them remove the outer areas around the original site... Then get checked up every year with a Dermatologist... These can appear anywhere on your body and not just at the original site. . I am not saying that you will get anymore of these, but that in years to come to always be aware of a suspicious mole that may occur in your life... Please do n't worry, just enjoy life... Take care... Caroline######I 'm super nervous-- had a mole biopsied and went in for my results today. Melanoma .33 mm. Dermatologist excised the area around the mole and scheduled me for closure on Thursday and to see the Oncologist on Friday (my birthday mind you). He made it sound very serious and scared ``the sheet '' out of me. After reading these posts I feel a little better. What should I expect at my Oncologist visit?######Sounds like you got it early. Why are you seeing an Oncologist? You have to ask questions. What Stage and what Clark level is this? Was there any more cancer around the mole? Jack######Dermatologist said he got all the tumor which he said was Clark Level II as it penetrated the dermis, but had a low mitotic rate. As a precaution he referred me to the Oncologist who said he would say I am at Stage 1. He scheduled a PET scan for this Thursday and a blood test to rule out any node or blood stream penetration. Information is so confusing... does survival rate mean the cancer comes back or the people die ?? This young mom is still scared..######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

Here are the details of the pathology report: Spitzoid Breslow depth- 1.1 mm (on the back it said this was a ``maximum '') Non-ulcerated Clark scale 4 Margins- I believe it indicated ``clear and defined '' Can anyone help determine what the prognosis for this might be? The doctor said that this was a stage 1A, possibly 1B. She is going back tomorrow for wider excision to ensure they got everything. She also was recommended to get a lymph node biospy, however the issue is that she is 35 weeks pregnant, so she has to wait until after we have the baby due to the radioactive dye they use. My question is- does anyone know how common a melanoma with these characteristics would be to have spread to the lymph nodes already? Does anyone have a link, or information to any ``rough estimates '' or percentage of cases that spread associated with the details above? We are extremely worried and would appreciate any help or feedback anyone can provide at this point! Thank you in advance!######Hello and welcome! It 's been a couple of weeks, so I do hope you receive this. The doctors will be able to know more about your wife's melanoma after her wide excision, but with the information given here her prognosis should be good. At a depth of 1.1 mm, it 's standard procedure to do a sentinal node biopsy- the docs do so for anything greater than 1mm. Keep in mind that 1mm is really, really, really thin, and the reason the docs want to do a SNB is to rule out any spreading. I 've encountered individuals who had melanomas that were greater than 3mm, and the lymph nodes were not impacted. I also know the toughest part in all of this is waiting. When I was diagnosed with melanoma, I could n't wait for the doctor to get that out of me! But the most important thing is for your wife to be delivered of a healthy baby. By now your wife should have had her wide excision and probably should have had the results from that surgery. The surgeon should have been able to tell you two what the rate of spreading is (mitotic rate). That is a big indicator of whether the melanoma is very fast growing or more slow growing. I know the panic that can set in with a diagnosis of melanoma. I was diagnosed in 2007 and the depth was .7 mm. It is now 5 1/2 years later and so far there is no evidence of disease. You two will get through this! Good luck!######Hi Thanks for the reply. The mitotic rate ended up being none identified. The doctor did the wle and said that all margins were completely clear. SNB is scheduled for 12/10. Keeping fingers crossed that all is well! Thanks again!.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I am only 24 which he says is young and I have a history of ovarian cancer. I kind of understand this whole thing but it is still setting in. I had a small, pink, perfectly round mole removed from my wrist area on March 21. It burned for 3 hours, I looked up ``BuRNING MOLE '' on the www and it said to get it checked. 2 weeks later it was off. The doc says that it was 1.1 mm deep, meaning Clarks Level IV, but it could be farther down since that is all they took. He also said it was non-ulcerative which is good news. Now I must get another surgery to remove more skin from the area, a skin graft, PET scan, and sentinel node biopsy. Anyone that can offer me any more information or their experience with this kind of cancer is much appreciated.######First of all, the more important stat is the 1.1 mm depth, also known as the Breslow depth. The Clark's level is not as indicative of your prognosis. 1.1 mm is still relatively thin, and non-ulcerated is good. This is assuming the biopsy got all of the melanoma. You should have a Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) done before the Wide Local Excision (WLE). The WLE basically takes a margin of skin around the mole to make sure they get any stray cancer cells. The SNB is a diagnostic tool, to measure if any lymph nodes have traces of melanoma cells in them. If so, then there are other measures they will discuss. I highly recommend you get treated at a hospital with experience in melanoma. What area do you live in? The National Cancer Institute's website (a. gov site) has lots of good info on melanoma and treatment, I suggest you start there. Good luck!######Your breslow depth is in the guidelines to have a SNB to check your sentinal lymph node. You will have a WLE to remove the lesion completely. There is a lot of info on the net. The clarks level is not a highly valued measurement anymore... and a lot of people confuse the clarks level with the ``STAGE ''. This is not your stage. The Breslow depth is more important because it shows how invasive your lesion is. My melanoma was 5.0 mm (Breslow), clarks level V, and that puts me at a stage IIB. Your doctor will be able to stage you. Wishing you the best! Keep us posted.######Ladypepper, you are an inspiration to all of us! Did n't mean to hijack the thread, just wanted to let you know######Wow that was very sweet! Thank you for that.######Well it 's true If you can make it thru all you 've had to deal with than so can I !!######I have a couple of questions.... I 'm a 42 y.o. female who has tanned my entire life, many sunburns as a child on Lake Michigan. In 1995 I had a mole removed from my abdomen and was told it was a Clark's Level 2. Over the next couple of years I had 2 more moles removed and diagnosed with Dysplastic Nevus Syndrom (I 've read that it means that you have a lot of moles and are at higher risk for skin cancer.) Over the years I have continued to tan regularly and have a tanning bed in my home, although I do use self-tanners regularly as well. I check my skin and go to the derm, but I 'm curious if the malignancy could have spread at all. Would it be beneficial to have the SLN test done? What is involved in that and am I just worrying for nothing? \*\* Please no lectures on tanning. I am aware of the risks involved and used to own a tanning salon. Thank you for any feedback!######I am assuming when you say SLN you mean the node biopsy? The time to do that would have been when you had your excision. What was your breslow depth if you remember? It sounds like you would have been a stage I and if your breslow depth was under 1.0 mm they probably would not have done a SNB. It is n't likely that it spread at that stage. It is n't impossible (especially if you continue to tan) but it is n't likely it metastisized.######They never mentioned the Breslow depth, just told me the Clark's info and said it was malignant melanoma. I went to my general physician who excised it and sent it off for biopsy. Thank you for responding!######Did you have any other treatment other than the biopsy? Did they do a WLE to get clean margins? Granted a Clarks level II is not as invasive but it still should have required an excision, unless the biopsy got clean margins. But your doctor should have explained it all to you. Just a suggestion, you may want to get a copy of your pathology report for that biopsy and it will have a Breslow depth on it... measured in mm. It is a good idea to keep copies for your own records anyway..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

He found a mole on my back the day of my surgery. He removed the mole and the lump. I just spoke to him today and he said the mole was skin cancer (melenoma) and it had cause the lympnode swelling. He setup a appt with a cancer doctor. I am just wondering what to expect? He wants the cancer doctor to look over my paperwork and give me his opinion. The appt is a month away and I did a search on google for melanoma but the more I look the more confused I am######Blue, Do you know the Breslow depth of your melanoma? And the Clark Level? Was melanoma also in the lymph node that was removed? If so, what kind of treatments are they suggesting for you? Websites often confuse some when you try to take in too much at once. I know I scared myself silly when I looked melanoma up after my diagnosis. Often times you see and read the worst case scenenarios which makes the ``anxiety '' worse. Let me know more about your pathology report and then I can tell you what I do know. Ok? God Bless! You 're in my prayers!######I spoke with my family Dr today, he is also a friend. He said that the skin cancer was one of the worst types 4 I think. I am sure the melanoma was in the lymphnode also. He suggested that I see the specialist and see what he suggest. I said what if I do nothing. He said its hard to tell I could have a few good months and then I would be gone, but he said its hard to define a few good `months' and it varies from people to people. Thanks.######Melanoma is serious stuff. I so sorry that this is happening to you. Your GP says ``a few good months '' if untreated, but it takes a month to see the specialist? Geesh! I 'd be on the phone looking for another specialist or filling a cancellation. Hope it works out well for you.######gblue, Tom made a really good point! You should call another specialist that would be able to see you sooner. You can even call the doctor you have the appointment with, and ask them if they could see you before (if there is a last minute cancellation) and/or ask them to give you the name of other specialist. Remember, it is your body and your life. If you do n't take pro-active steps to find out what you have and what your options are, no one else will. What you do n't know could hurt you. You are in my prayers....######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

This means ``on the surface ''... it is considered Stage 0 in Melanoma staging.######I KNOW this sounds like a really dumb question, but... the last one they took off of DH they got the big wide margins but they went deep- it bled and bled, 4 weeks later and he is still bruised, he still said it is in- situ but gee it sure did n't seem like `surface '. . The dr said that he goes to the fat level- to me that sounds deep, but I do n't know. Thanks again Lady for your wonderful help, calm and knowledge! Happy Easter !!!######Be glad that you have a dr that takes it seriously. It needs to come out to the fat layer. I had over 30 + stitches. Took a hunk out the size of a golf ball (down to the fat layer) and had a skin fold with doggie ears that I thought would never heal right. Today (9 months later) it is just a scar with a purplish color. No dog ear looking thingys on it. Yay! LOL! In situ needs an excision the same as any other but it 's the ``beginnings of mm '' and its in place,,, in position... no growth down or up or out. The BESt possible to have. God Bless! Happy Easter to you all!######Hi GA, I just stopped by to wish you and everyone a Happy Easter. My doc that did my biospy Monday, must be a great surgeon. When the removal was first done by the dermotologist, I had one stitch that hurt, itched, and was really uncomfortable. My five sticthes from the last one, there is no pain, no itch, nothing. He also told me that this is the result of childhood overexposure to the sun. I hope everyone with small children take extra care that they never experience sunburn. I had many blistering ones as a child. Have a safe and glorious Easter!######Happy Easter to you and everyone also. Mine did n't hurt either. So yes I believe you gotcha a good surgeon! Glad your healing well. I am a strawberry-blonde redhead, so you can imagine everything that has been trauma to my skin. I spent almost every year at the beach when I was growing up. With some sunscreen but always came out with a blistering sunburn every single year. Then when I was in my late teens and early twenties I decided I 'd lay in the tanning bed. Bad Bad Mistake. Although some people do get it where the ``sun does n't shine '' mine was on the back of my left arm. above my elbow. I would say mine was sun exposure. Most definetly! Good Luck to you as always and to everyone here! May we all have a Blessed Weekend and Remember the TRUE meaning of Easter! I am going to my in laws down at the home of the Georgia Dawgs! LOL! I am soooooooo lookin forward to it. God Bless!.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I never saw this derm before, I think he 's new to the practice. Anyway, he quickly looked at it and said it was ``some warty thing '' and he could freeze it off. I told him I would prefer if he remove it as my sister had melanoma. He agreed, but only did a shave biopsy. I 've read on here from several people to never allow a shave biopsy. So I wondered why exactly. After some reading, I found that shave will interupt the diagnosing of depth if the lesion is melanoma. I also read that shaves should never be used if melanoma is suspected. So, my question is, if not even the most trained eye can be 100% certain which moles are melanoma and which are not, why are shave biopsys ever done on a mole? Should n't every mole or pigmented lesion be removed by excision only? Are n't these doctors in the dermatology field who do shaves on moles being negligent in the event that a mole truly is melanoma? Just curious about this issue. Thanks !!######Hi Irisrose I 've had a malignant melanoma in the past, also had a mole curetted off. The curetted one, like yours was a warty looking thing. It was itchy & bleeding but from experience, my doctor reckoned it was n't malignant & he was right. Healing time was so much faster than all the other benign ones I 've had removed by excision. Even if the mole is indeed a melanoma, you 'd still need to go back for a wider excision, shaved or excised. I had a huge V shaped chopped out after having my melanoma excised first time round. Do n't know about the depth thing though. They 'd still have a pretty good idea as to whether or not it was likely to spread from the second excision I 'd reckon. I 'm no expert though- just speaking from having had quite a few moles removed. Lidia######If MM is suspected then a excisional is the best way to go. So what if we have the scars at least we are alive !!! (just not that important to me) however, if he wo n't do a excisional, then a punch biopsy is next best. Never a freeze or shave and I do not know why they are still done, unless they know for 100% it is not cancerous. Staging is one of (if not the most) critical steps in the post surgical care and treatment regime for MM. If you were dx 'd as stage 1 then followup at what ever your oncologist suggests. If stage 2 then more, and so on and so on up the ladder to stage 5. it needs to be staged in order to set you on the path of treatment. Not to be confused with `clarks level ' which is not the `stage at which you are ' for example, I am stage 2 clarks level 3 all done through the excisional biopsy, and of course more mm was found at the bottom (my lesion was rather thick) thus I had a WLE which needs a 5cm margin all around. This was decided from the orignal pathology from the excisional biopsy I had in the first place. Bonnie######Through much of my reading, I have actually found that punch is even less reliable for diagnosing melanoma. Because it takes just a small punch in the thickest part of the lesion, the melanoma could actually be next to that mole and not in the mole itself. So it would be possible to not get the melanoma cells in a punch. I 've read that if a deep shave is performed getting the breadth of the lesion, it 's almost as good as excision. I do n't believe mine was a deep shave, but it looks like he took it all off. It was pretty small. I just was wondering why they even do them. No doctor can be certain without a doubt that a mole is n't melanoma. We 've read enough stories of people being diagnosed and even their derm was surprised. So if they are n't God and know what lurks under that mole, then why is n't shave and punch biopsys discouraged throughout the dermatology field? Seems a little negligent to me. Thanks for the replys.######Yes my surgeon (plastic surgeon) automatically does the excisional biopsy. My mole was 4.00 mm thick, and he was (as was my family doctor) totally shocked that it was MM. I go to my oncologists every 3 months now for 3 years and then every six months then on to every year. With MM it is so nasty.... not obvious at all, and can hide for many years before (or never) resurfacing. My worst fear now is mets to anywhere. The local hospital where I had the WLE are not equipped to do the SNB so that was not performed, much to the dismay of the cancer hospital I now go these every 3 months. Plus full body checks at my dermatologist every three months. Not to mention the many CT scans I have had to have this past year. I never sunbathed, in fact I always sought the shade, but was burned as an infant, and of course at my age, when we were kids we played outside all the day long. I do not understand the young and not so young people who sun worship or use tanning salons all for the sake of what? SIGH!######Irisrose, I 'm glad to hear that you have finally had a biopsy on the mole that was worrying you. The simple truth is that the lesion you had removed was a small one and that a shave biopsy was probably all that was needed. You will get a result from this. And if (and it 's IS still an if) the mole turns out to be a melanoma then you will have to go back for a wider excision anyway. Have faith. We all hear the stories about doctors missing things. It happens. They are human. But there comes a point that you have to just believe them. They are highly trained and many have worked in the field for many years. The truth is the `misses ' are not the norm. They are the exception. For every horror story you hear there are thousands more patients that are fine. Irisrose, have a little faith in your doctor. What and see what the result is first. Shave biopsies do have their place in dermatology.######Tauri is right. I too work for a derm and well... we do alot of shaves. My melanoma was a shaved biopsy but the depth of the melanoma was exactly the depth of the melanoma. .80 in Breslow... and was a Clark IV. I am only doing 3 month follow ups and just had a Chest CT done yesterday and I am hoping that will be ok... Then on to an MRI next Friday on the arm that Mel because of this funky looking space on the bend of my arm. The derm does n't think it 's anything and the oncologists does n't either but their doing it for their peace of mind and mine too! So ya 'll pray that my results turn out good. See... I still worry too! And I work for my derm. You can SIT and SLEEP at the Dr's office and not prevent mel... but it 's just one of those things that we have to remember we 've had and always get follow ups! Also my derm does pretty deep shaves too... Like over the 1 mm deeep thing... so... that tells alot also. !######Thanks for answering. The reason I had asked about shave biopsys was much of what I 've read about that type of biopsy and melanoma. I just wondered why they are still done on any skin lesion if it makes it difficult for the pathologist to stage the melanoma. I know that because mine was so small that he got all of it with the shave. But I still just wanted to question you guys on the reasoning for it. Like the internet with so many topics, you can find info for one side, but not always the practical, hands on info for the other side. Thanks a lot! I 'll post back and let everyone know what the results are. P.S. GaLady- I 'll be sending good thoughts your way. I hope all of your scans and tests turn out fine !! Good luck!.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

This is not meant to scare anyone, it is meant to inform everyone about how serious this disease is... Here goes... In October 2003 my brother had a malignant melanoma mole removed from his chest. They did a wide area excision and check of his nearest lymph nodes to see if they had been affected. They had n't. He was sent home with a clean bill of health. He was to be checked by a dermatologist every three months from then on, which he did. He checked out fine each time. Now, fast forward to August 2006. He started getting a sore back and made an appointment to see the doctor on September 19. His pain was getting severe and we thought that he had a slipped disc or whatever. Unfortunatly, it was n't a back problem. A lymph node in his armpit was swollen and black. Had it biopsied and sure enough, it was melanoma back again. However, this time there were no moles or outward signs on his body... He was diagnosed with metastatic (which means it spread to other organs) melanoma on September 22, and he passed away from the disease on November 3, 2006. Exactly 45 days after he was diagnosed. Melanoma is a very serious disease and you can not always detect it on the skin. My brothers disease had spread to his brain, spine, liver, galbladder, subcutaneous fatty tissue and lungs. There were NO visible signs of his disease. This disease took his life in a matter of months. He was only 34 years old... !!! We have no idea when it came back, or where it came back, but, we do know that it was NOT on his skin. Metastatic melanoma is the most deadly, painful and untreatable of all cancers. I am light skinned and freckled and run a high risk of getting this disease myself. The thing that worries me is that it is not always on the skin which is a common myth. Unfortunatly, there is no other way to detect it short of a cat scan every couple of months (which is impossible financially). If any of you have melanoma, please be sure to get your checks, and beware of swollen lymph nodes. I am not trying to scare anyone, but, I was my brothers best friend and acted as his caregiver for the last 6 weeks of his life and I learned way more about this disease than I ever cared to know... Take care... In memory-Louis August 17, 1972-November 3, 2006...######I am so sorry to hear of the passing of your brother. Your information will help people take better care of themselves. I for one, will continue to be adamant with the doctors and getting my check ups. Please do the same with yourself. Your brother was very lucky to have you there for him, his guardian angel. I want to thank you for posting for the rest of us. It may be the life you save today because of your post. Janie######Thank you for sharing your story. I 'm so sorry for your loss. May God bless Louis, your family, and all those who have suffered because of malignant melanoma. Sincerely, L.L.######I am so sorry to hear that! I had melanoma also. They scanned my lymph nodes & removed three, but they were clean. Where else are your lymph nodes? I know under your armpits, but where else?######Lymph nodes arae in the neck, groin area too. What Clarks Level were you?######thanks everyone... I am still getting used to not having him around,... It has only been 2 weeks !!! But, they checked my brothers lymph nodes in the armpit because his melanoma was on his chest and those were the closest ones. However, I think they are throughout the body especially in the neck and groin area as westllen said... I have no idea what you are talking about concerning the Clarks level though. Must have something to do with how deep the mole was ???? We never did hear anything about the Clarks level... Basically, we were past that point, and into Stage IV of the cancer, so Clarks level was n't even an issue... swollen (and discolored) lymph nodes were one of my brothers first signs... Incidently, once the cancer passes to the lymph nodes, it basically passes to the rest of the body (organs) through those... Good luck to you with your melanoma... Keep getting your checks and at the first sign of ANYTHING out of the ordinary, please get checked out... I wish you well, and I am sure you will be fine... Just try hard to keep on top of it... Good luck to everyone, and thanks for the well wishes...######I agree that once you have been told you have melanoma, you must be extra vigilant with regards to your body. I would also had, that you should try to get into some clinical trials if at all possible. My brother passed away of melonoma at the age of 34 yrs also.... I miss him dearly.######I am sorry to hear about your loss too Danialla... I read somewhere that Melanoma kills mostly men between the ages of 25 and 50. And that the most deaths occur in men who are 34 years old... Is n't that just crazy... ??? It 's far to young to die that 's for sure... Again, I am sorry for your loss and I agree about getting checks and maybe doing clinical trials. I have also heard recently that they have a melanoma vaccine in the works and it works on dogs... (Yes, pets get melanoma too...) Anyways, it has n't been tested on humans yet and could be a number of years before it is available for humans (if ever), but, it sure seems promising... My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who is suffering from cancer and thier loved ones... Good luck to all...######My father has been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in July 06. He was doing fine until the end of Sept but then started spine problem. Now he is completely in bed and also has it in brain and lungs as well. My prayers are with you. We are in the same boat.######My heart breaks for you. What where your father's symptoms? Your family is in my prayers.######I am so sorry to hear about your brother, those Dr's should be shot! My husband had it yrs ago level 1V. His lymph nodes were fine but to be safe the Dr took them out on the same side his cancer was. That was 18yrs ago & he 's fine. Makes me so mad they should have known better. He is in my prayers.######I am very sympathetic to you and feel for your loss. No one should have to die from melanoma. You did not post your brothers mole depth, the staging, or clark level. I had a stage 1A melanoma removed in 2003 (.04 mm and clarks 2). I would gladly have had a sentinal node biopsy, but my doctors would not do it. My wife is a breast cancer survivor (12 years). She has no lymph nodes on her left arm because they removed them all. She gets lymphodemia that gets worse with age. Her left arm swells and hurts her some. She has had two severe infections in that arm from simple cuts. So doctors have to weigh risks with treatments. I have had some scares but am still fine. I would not shoot the doctors. Over 95 &#37; of Stage 1A are fine with just wide excission. Do n't 2nd guess decissions that are already made.######I am very sorry to hear about your brother. One thing that is definite about melanoma, is that it is NOT predictable. Not knowing what stage your brother was makes it more difficult to know how badly the doctor did n't do what he should have. If at his WLE he was a stage I- he probably would have been told by the majority of doctors to just watch himself and live his life. If he was stage II or III or IV, he probably would have been given more options. It is impossible to know what the next move melanoma will take. I am stage IIB. I had a breslow of 5.0 mm and was a clarks level of V. Thankfully I was still staged at IIB because it is n't showing in any nodes. There are people with much smaller breslow and they are stage III or IV because it has traveled. Like I said- I am sorry about your brother- any melanoma death is tragic. But if you watch yourself and get regular checks, you have a better chance of catching anything early and that is the key to survival. Health and Happiness to you.######Hello everyone. I am going to sound really stupid with this reply, but the truth is, that when my brother had his wide area excision in 2003, I have no idea what his breslow or clarks was. At the time, although my hubby and I were his best friends, he was married. So, I was n't near as involved with his medical care, or things of that nature. He divorced since that happened, and that is how I wound up caring for him... All I really knew at that time (2003) was that he was a stage I and after the excision, they checked the nodes, and they were clear so they gave him a clean bill of health... That 's about all I really knew. I never found his medical records from that time in his house after his death, so I assume maybe his ex-wife has them? I will ask her... If not, maybe I could get a copy from the Dr's? When he was diagnosed in 2006 with metastatic melanoma, they never mentioned anything about clarks, or breslow levels. Pretty much because it did n't matter. He was full of cancer, and it was just stage IV metastic disease. I will try to find out those other details though. I am really interested to know all of the details now... I am going to the derm for the first time on the 21st of this month. Wish me luck...######Once the melanoma metastisized, clarks and breslow would not exist... only when diagnosed is when it is usually important. Also stage I with no node involvement is normally a great prognosis. I hope your appointment goes well. Just a suggestion, write down any questions that you want to ask so that when you are in there you do n't forget them. I always forget to ask something I wanted to ask. lol######I am so sorry to read about your brother. I myself had a melanoma removed from my right breast in nov.. I never thought at 24 I would have to deal with this. I completely understand how you feel with the fact that he had no skin signs. My freckle was just that a freckle or mole, whatever you want to call it. I had no irregular border, odd shape, or raised at all. My doctor had it checked out just to make sure, but she was n't concerned at all, then the report came back 2 weeks later that it was early stage melanoma. By the time she called me, surgery was already scheduled, which was very frightening. It was very hard to hear because you look at pictures and just say that it is n't possible, because that is n't how mine looks. Then with your brother, who had no signs, I cann ' t even imagine. I myself am trying to tell everyone to get checked, just to be safe. What I have discovered is yes it is very treatable, but bye the time the ``signs '' are apparent, it might be to late. I go every 3 months to a derm. as well, terrified if they will find something new or not. I hope that you and your family are doing as well as you can be in a difficult time like this. I see that you have many other post on here, do you have melanoma? (REMOVED) Thank-you.######Hi Snowchickkim... I do n't have melanoma as far as I know. I go in for my first appointment on Feb 21. My brother is the only person I have known with Melanoma, and I am not all that well informed on the topic... Thanks for the reply Ladypepper, you gave me lots of info (like why they never mentioned Clarks or breslow levels...) I go to the derm next weds, and I am a little nervous to say the least. I am 30 (a year younger than my brother was at his first diagnosis), and I am covered in freckles and moles... I have light skin, green eyes and burn easily. All of that coupled with the fact of my bro dying from this has me a little worried... Just wish me luck... thanks... god bless...######You are very welcome and being worried is totally understandable! I hope everything goes fine at your appointment. Keep us posted.######Hi Guys... Went to the derm today... Got 4 spots taken off just to be on the safe side... Love my derm, she does n't screw around... However, I just about fell over when I got the bill... Over$ 1,000.00 for todays visit... I ca n't afford cancer-I have no insurance... Anyways, I will get the results back on Friday or Monday... I am sure all will be fine... I will let you all know... tata...######Hi Everyone... Well, I got the results back of the biopsies I had the other day and they all came back clear... All benign, and nothing to worry about at this point !!! YIPPEE !!!! Anywho-just wanted to let you all know... Needless to say, I am over joyed... Now, I just need to get that big bill paid. . !!!! Have a great weekend everyone !!!######Great news! Congrats! Keep watching your skin and keep up on your check ups. That is very good news.######I am so sorry for your tragedy. This story is so much how my Dad found his cancer was back. He had two melanomas removed from his back and had no signs of it coming back for almost 7 years. Then he started getting some pains, mostly in his back and abdomen. We thought possibly kidney stones, but he felt it was worse and went to see his cancer doctor. His cancer doctor actually tried to blow him off and told him he was fine, because he had no outward signs of having cancer, but at my Dad's insistence, the idiot doctor FINALLY agreed to a PET scan. The PET scan showed my Dad had metastatic melanoma with sites in his liver, lungs, spleen, bones... pretty much everywhere. He has been through a few rounds of biochemotherapy, and is now doing a different chemo, while awaiting a clinical trial, while the insurance sits on their arses and twiddles their thumbs hoping my Dad will die before they have to pay for anything. Stupid good for nothing, scumsucking, lower than dirt.... oh sorry. ANYWAY, if you 've had skin cancer before, it 's likely you 'll get it again. If you think something might be wrong, DO N'T LET YOUR DOCTORS BLOW IT OFF !!!!! Be pushy, insist they run the tests, and if they wo n't, then find a doctor who will !!! If my Dad had listened to his doctor, he 'd be dead now.######Sorry to hear about your dad... My brother died 45 days after he was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, so it would seem that your father is in a little better shape. . (thank goodness). . What you 've said is true on many levels... Of course the insurance company is hoping that your dad will die before they have to pay-they are bottom-feeding, scumsuckers... Secondly, if you have had skin cancer, I am also a true believer in the fact that it will come back... Unfortunatley, it seems that melanoma in particular does n't always come back on the skin-that just happens to be the ``primary '' site... My brother did n't have any cancer on his skin when he passed... By then it was all in his organs, brain and bone... Who knows how long it had been growing... kudos to your dad for not letting the Dr. push him around... Everyone just needs to be extra vigilant when it comes to skin cancer... It really is way more serious than I ever really imagined until it struck my best friend... Good luck with your dad and hopefully the clinical trial will help and will be worth it in the end... Your dad is a saint to even sign up for a clinical trial... His participation may save someones life someday... Good luck to you all-you are in my thoughts and prayers... Please keep us posted as to his progress... bp######I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in feb07 then in march 07 the radiation doctor spotted two moles on my back and he wanted them checked before any procedure is done. So in mar 07 they discovered i had melanoma that has spread but they do n't know where it spread to and they are going to do surgery on apr 9 07. Can this be the same cancer that spread to the prostate?######I dunno about that Lakebulter (sp)... I actually do n't know much about cancer in general. But, when a cancer spreads it is called a metasticized Cancer. For example my brother had metastatic melanoma meaning that his ``primary site '' of the cancer that spread was melanoma. You can have metastatic breast, colon, prostate whatever, cancer. (I think)... Now, the spots on your back are melanoma and the prostate cancer would appear to be seperate. If they think that the cancer has spread they will probably give you a CT scan and PET scan or one or the other. Who knows, maybe there 's no cancer in the prostate but maybe other locations, which would seem to make them completely seperate. I would imagine that if you got the cancer in the prostate from melanoma you would have already known you had melanoma...? Am I making any sense ??? hahahaaaa... Anyways, you may never really know for sure... Obviously, cancer is a big mystery even to the medical and scientific community. At any rate-good luck to you... You will remain in my thoughts and prayers as you battle through this. Hang in there-be vigilant about asking your Dr.'s these kinds of questions. God Bless.######I already had two ct scan and they had missed the melonama cancer on my back.######Hi Lakebulter... Sorry to hear that they missed the cancer on your back... I suppose if that is the case- then the prostate cancer could 've actually been metasticized melanoma. ?? ... I find it odd that they would have missed it with a CT scan... Maybe it was very small ??? I wish I had answers for you... Just keep vigilant about your dr.'s... If you read on these posts, there are many folks who were not happy with the care they or a loved one recieved from thier dr.s... I for one was very unhappy about how the oncologists treated my brother... They were ready to make him into a guniea pig... And, they would never actually give us a straight answer to our questions... We got excellent care and support from the Dr. who actually diagnosed my brother and he was just a GP working at our local clinic (for folks with no insurance, they give lower rates for self pay patients, etc....) He is the most honest, informative, and caring Dr. I have ever met... He would call me every 3 days to see how my brother was doing. He gave me his home, office and cell phone numbers in case we needed meds or to talk or anything... He is now my primary physician... I wo n't even consider seeing anyone else... I wish that all the dr.s could 've been like him-but, the other dr.s needed us to tell them who we were everytime, ask the same questions over and over like they never saw us before (which they had)... Anywho-not to get on my soapbox about that (sorry)... The point is, keep pestering your dr.'s about all of your questions... You may even consider getting a second opinion or changing dr.'s all together... What you are going through is no joke and you really need someone who can help you through it... I am very sorry that you even have to deal with this and I wish you luck with everything. Please let us know how things progress... You will remain in my thoughts and prayers....######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

Some people can have a very thin melanoma but penetrate into the fat layer. Mine was a thin melanoma of .80 but went to the Clark Level of IV but luckily it hadnt spread to the lymphs. But the ONLY way to ``kind of '' tell is to have a SNB (Senital Node Biopsy) done and then you will know where the basin of the lymph is flowing and which lymph nodes need to be removed for biopsy. I didnt fall into that criteria. Although I had a choice of doing this. But I chose not to due to the fact that oft times this in not a conclusive test and can often times cause much swelling of the limbs. I chose scans. MRI's and then they sent me on for a Pet Scan to see if it had metasized in my organs. It had not! Praise the Lord! Do you have a superficial spreading melanoma? Or know someone who does? Or are you just curious?######Yea, I had thought about that and realized it isnt based on time. No one was diagnosed with it. Just having a suspicious mole removed and biopsied. Just looks a awful lot like superficial to me. But, I am sure there have been lots look like it and not be that. Getting it done Monday, so hopefully Ill know next week if it is anything to keep worrying about. Prayers please. Thank You.######Prayers sent up for you! And you 're right. Sometimes melanoma looks normal. Sometimes what looks scarey is normal! So its hard to say. I pray that yours in normal! Please let us know! K!######Another question. IS it likely to have more than one mole that is melanoma at one time? Can alot of them be melanoma at once? Is that unusual?######Had my mole removed today. Be a week for results. Gosh thats a long time to think about that!.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

I had a biopsy and was diagnosed with malignant melanoma on the bottom of my foot the beginning of Feb.. I have not yet had the surgery to remove the tumor which back in Feb was determined to be a Clarks Level IV and have a Breslow Depth of 2.7 mm. One of my questions is how safe is it to wait this long to remove the tumor? My surgeon is not a very approachable man. His reply to me when I asked him was that I had told him I have had this on my foot for a long time. Not very helpful. Another question is, when is the ``staging '' done? I am assuming that is decided upon after the surgery to remove it? Thank you to anyone who can help. If anyone has had this, I would love to hear from you.######Hi Lady Pepper, I was diagnosed with the ``m '' word back in July of last year. My lesion was on my left arm. After diagnosis, I was scheduled for surgery within 2 weeks time. (as a work-in) and my surgeon was there to speak to me anytime I needed him. If I were you, I would look and search for someone who has compassion in this trying time of fear and the unknown. You deserve that! Ok enough about me and on to the staging stuff... Some dr's stage differently but there is a staging process that begins AFTER you have had your surgery! You will also need to have a Sentinal Node Biopsy to determine if this has went to a groin lymphnode. My breslow of mine was only a .80 but my Clark was also a IV but I chose not to have a Sentinal Node Biopsy done. Most dr's go by the breslow. Anything over 1 mm then they perform a Sentinal Node Biopsy. My dr told me mine was my choice. I chose not too. Since this is on your foot, I would choose to have it done. That way you can have a complete stage diagnosis. And for another, you will have peace of mind. I would also request a CT scan and blood work, and also after all the surgery and all is well. I would repeat the scan process. That is just what I would do. I pray for you a full recovery. But the main thing I want to say is, Please seek a Melanoma Specialist. Dont rely on a surgeon who has no bedside manner. Go to someone that you would trust your life with. Because basically, with melanoma, you have to have someone with the knowledge but also someone with the compassion to help you through all this. Feel free to post again and I will answer you the best I know how to. God Bless!######Thank you for the reply and advice. I appreciate it. I wish that I could be more picky with doctors. This doctor is supposed to be a good surgeon, but his manners are lacking. lol. I am supposed to be scheduled for the surgery finally on Thursday... which they will be doing a sentinal node biopsy.######I have n't checked in her in a while. How did the surgery go? And the SNB?######Thank you for asking. I just had my surgery yesterday. I have not gotten any results or info from my doctor yet. I will be calling tomorrow to see what is up. He did tell my aunt there was a spot he wasnt ' sure about but did n't take it cause it would have required a skin graft and he wanted to wait to see the report. As for the SNB... I do n't want to scare anyone, but it was not fun! I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, and this was very painful to me... maybe cause it was on the bottom of my foot, I do n't know. But it hurt. Thanks for asking.######I am glad all went well with you through your surgery! Rest up! All will go fine I am sure!######Thank you Ga Lady. I have n't heard anything at all yet about the results. I am still very sore... in both areas. I have n't been able to take the pain medication because it made me really sick. I thought that the first day was cause of being put to sleep... but the second day was worse and then I realized it was the pain medication. So I have n't been able to take anything but Motrin. I called the dr. office but have n't gotten any other information yet. I wonder how long it takes to get the reports? Oh well. I hope you are doing well.######Normally 10-14 working days from what I hear. Have you asked the dr if you can take another kind of pain med? There are other kinds that wo n't make you sick. It wo n't hurt to ask... I would! Just to be comfortable. Let us know what you hear..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Skin

However, just this week I am having a dryness in my throat that almost feels like I have cotton in my throat. It moves from one side to another. Of course it is making me cough. Has anyone experienced this as a side effect of Lisinopril. It is driving me crazy and I ca n't sleep. I am hoping it is something else because I am very happy with the way Lisinopril is keeping my pressure under control.######From what I 've read, Lisinopril can be responsible for a cough in some people-- in fact, it 's called the Lisinopril Cough! I would definitely talk to your doctor about it as some people just can not tolerate the Lisinopril. Good luck to you.######Oh yes, I definitely am familiar with Lisinopril Cough !! I toughed it out for the 3-month period waiting to see my doctor again, but I was coughing so much and so hard that I would frequently vomit. My doctor scolded me for not calling him to report it. He switched me to Diovan which is working fine, but is more expensive (which is why he tried Lisinopril first). Once off of it, the cough disappeared pretty quickly..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Nothing seems to help. I 've increased fiber and water and use creams, but they wo n't go away. Has anyone else experienced persistent hemorrhoids on lisinopril?######I have had the exact same problem. In the past 10 + years I 've typically had one or two VERY MINOR hemorrhoid flare-ups. I mean MINOR, where some PrepH for a day or two resolved my issue for the next year or so. Then I went on 10mg of Lisinopril and in about my second month I started battling rhoids every day. I 'm still there....5-6 weeks later, using the medicine numerous times per day with little relief. I had found Clytie232's (and several other) post after the first week. Spoke with my doc, he laughed at me, told me not to put too much stock in the internet and immediately recommended laser surgery to correct. I 'm an IT guy by trade and did electronics in the USAF for 8 years so my analytical skills are pretty good. It 's not a coincidence that shortly after starting Lisinopril I developed the worst case of rhoids of my life AND when I thought to check the internet, several others were complaining of the same thing. My logic says that 's no coincidence. If I 'd developed extremely sore knees for instance and checked online and nobody had reported that, then I 'd say the cause was not the Lisinopril, but that 's not the case here. Anyone else having the same issues?######Wow! could this be real? I have the same issue as well started lisinopril 20 mg about a year ago and it has been hell since !! My rhoids have been a daily and painfull battel. I went to my general doc about 6 months ago and he gave me some suppositories to no avail... went to a proc docotor and he said to up my fiber and drink lots of water !! I have tried almost every otc medication, home remedy to help with these hemorrhoids and no relief. I never considered the fact lisinopril could be the underlying cause to this awful pain.######I looked up the side effects on lisinopril and hemoorhoids is n't listed as one of them. Other medications that you maybe taking can cause constipation. Straining and forcing stool out is what causes hemorrhoids. Getting at lest 30 minutes of exercise each day helps to keep from getting constipated as well as maintaining regularity.######Thank you everyone who wrote about their problems with lisinopril and hemorrhoids. My doctor and wife do n't believe there is a connection. I also have the same exact problem. My hemorrhoids started about 2 to 3 months after I started lisinopril. My wife is a LPN and said that there is no side effect of hemorrhoids to lisinopril and that I am just getting older. I have never had hemorrhoids in my life. I have always been a healthy person and never had a problem in that area of my body. The hemorrhoid pain I ve been going through is nonstop. I have tried hemorrhoid creams and suppositories with no help. I am taking up to six ibuprofen a day just to manage the pain. I think I d rather have high blood pressure then this excruciating anus pain. The pain only raises my blood pressure more, what s the point! If you are on lisinopril and have hemorrhoids, they will never stop unless you get off of lisinopril..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Bowel Disorders

A year ago, I developed this annoying lump in my throat. I 've been semi-diagnosed with anything from menopausal to thyroid related. I 've seen 3 different gp's in the group and an ent. No one had any idea why I have this lump sensation. The last 3 mos. I 've been getting edemas around the throat and back which last about 4 hours and then disappear. My pharmacist suggested all this could be from a side effect of lisinopril. My doctor has switched me to toprol xl because He claims its a possibly also. My question is, does anyone know how long it takes to get rid of this sensation or what I can do to help it? It 's driving me crazy !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Other than that I feel fine but my neck feels swollen (but its not) at least the red rash on my neck for 10 years is gone. Also my throat and mouth is very dry.

Her Doctor Prescribed Lisinopril For The Blood Pressure And Metfromin For The The Diabetes. My Question Is Can She Still Take Vitamin B Or Is There Something Else She Can Take? She Gets Bad Headaches And Is Always Tired. Before She Found Out She Would Take Vitamin B To Give Her Energy.######Hello lopez, Welcome to the boards! Theoretically, it would be best to ask this question of your doctor-- theoretically, he or his nurse should have asked your mother exactly what supplements, over the counters, rx meds she has taken, is taking, or takes once in awhile before he wrote the prescription. And even if the doctor/nurse does ask, they do n't always take our responses into account when they write our prescriptions. So I would recommend that you check with your pharmacist. There are many different Vitamin B's... B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, etc.. . but I suspect your mother may be taken a vitamin b that contains many of the different categories. I 've been on lisinopril and do n't remember any warnings regarding Vitamin B supplementation-- you might want to check your package insert info just to be sure. Lisinopril is an ace inhibitotor, and ACE's are known to cause a cough. From what I 've read, increasing one's iron can reduce or eliminate this side effect. If that 's the case, your mother's Vitamin B's might actually be beneficial in preventing this particular side effect (you need some b's to prevent iron deficiency). One thing to be aware of, is to not take an anti acid within 2 hours of taking the lisinopril. If you do this, the lisinopril will lose it 's effectiveness. Bottom line, I suspect the Vitamin B's will help your mother and protect her from the ``cough ''... but you should check that out with your pharamacist just to be sure!

I am wondering if anyone who has ever taken lisinopril has experienced edema/severe pain in the knees while on this drug. Also sever mood disorder with atenolol.######I took lisinopril for 3 days, it caused a severe rash and swelling of the face, and a couple of days later my legs swelled up so badly that the Dr. sent me for an ultrasound to make sure that I did n't have blood clots in my legs. If you are having problems I would suggest you stop the drug and notify your Dr. This drug does not require gradual discontinuance. Best of Luck######Welcome to the HealthBoards! I took Lisinopril for five years and had no side-effects whatsoever. The most common side effect is coughing. If you feel sure the side effect is from Lisinopril, I agree- you should just stop the drug if the side effect is severe. If it is mild, you might want to call the doctor's office first. I 've never taken Atenolol.######Edema with lisinopril is a sign of an allergic reaction... stop immediately. It could be angioedema, a VERY serious and potentially deadly reaction, and this class of drugs can cause it. THis reaction USUALLY but not always hits soon after starting the drug. Take a benadryl if you have any... helps if it 's angioedema. Is there any sign of lips, eyelid or facial swelling? Usual complaint with the ACE inhibitors though is incesssant coughing but that 's not too serious just annoying as can be. Atenolol and mood disorders are a common combo but at least not immediately dangerous.######Lenin, I have woke up several times with one eye swollen, I do n't know if it is the med or because I sleep on my face a lot. Thanks for the input everyone.######I took atenolol for a month and experienced anxiety. the doctor told me the med was n't causing it, but it went away a day after I stopped it.######Last year I started getting severe leg swelling after taking a different BP drug from those you mention. I also started getting knee pain. I was then put on lisinopril instead. I now get intermittent knee pain which makes walking difficult as it 's pretty bad when it happens. On good days it 's just the left knee. On bad days it 's both knees and ankles. Since it started with doxazosin I did n't associate it with the lisinopril until I read your post. I 've noticed some swelling sometimes (legs, feet and tongue). It seems to be associated with sugar and salt consumption and BP medication together rather than any of these separately.

It 's hereditary, as both my father and mother have it (my father's started at the age of 16). Anyway, I 've been on a number of medications over the years. I recently switched to Lisinopril, right about the time I increased my Lexapro dosage from 5mg to 10mg. I was having side effects from the Lisinopril, so I stopped taking it. When I went back to my doctor, my blood pressure was 120/84! Since then, it has hovered around that mark. I think the highest it 's been was 127/87 (my diastolic number normally runs from 95 to 100). I am going to keep watching it, but at this point, it appears that the Lexapro has reduced my blood pressure. I have no idea why, or whether the effect will last, but my doctor decided to leave off the blood pressure medications for now. I am curious if anyone else has had this side effect from Lexapro. Any shared experiences would be appreciated. Thanks.######Actually when I went on it, it lowered my BP as well. I was shocked. I 'm thinking of getting back on it soon.######I too had to go off Lisinopril due to side effects but quickly went on an ARB as a substitute. As my anxiety attacks ramped up... two years later found myself on Lexapro. Yup, after the horrid initial side effects helped BP too. Yeah! Killed two birds with one stone. Still on the ARB though.######Very interesting data. I 'm anxious to see whether the effect lasts, but even if I do have to start a low dose of a new BP medication on down the road, I 'm still pretty happy about benefit.######I was taking Lisinopril as well. What side effects did you have violet? Mine was swelling of the tongue and neck that occurred around 5 months after I started on it. It is interesting that Lexapro has lowered BP in some patients and raised it in others. SSRI's are known to cause BP to rise temporarily. I 've been on Paxil as well and it never bothered me as far as I can remember.######I felt tired on Lisinopril.

I have been sick for 4 1/2 yrs with all kinds of stuff. But the lastest is severe indigestion and pain in the chest and difficulty getting a cleansing breath. Air hunger. I went to a cardiologist and he ruled out anything to do with the heart. I am scared to death. Does anybody have this with fibro? I also have had tingling on the top of my head for a 1 1/2 years now and neck pain. Joints hurt, lower back pain, pain inbetween the shoulder blades that burn. Sometimes feels like i have a cold. TMJ symptoms also. Lots more just do n't have time now to write the whole list. Right now it is the chest and the breathing problem that i am scared about. I am going to schedule an upper gi test this week. Oh, also I do have a hiatal hernia. I have had problems like this before but never as severe and not with the breathing issue. Does anybody have any input? LaLa P.S. Just went to the third reumotologist. Have to get blood work. 4 1/2 yrs and no answers yet. I have gone crazy !!!!!######Lala, Sorry you are suffering with this. With the indigestion and difficulty getting a breath, ask your physician if this could be ``LPR '', laryngeal pharyngeal reflux disease. It is when acid from the stomach travels up the esophagus and into the throat and sometimes the lungs which can cause difficulty breathing, coughing, indigestion, etc.. It is similar to GERD in the fact that the valve that keeps contents from traveling up to the esophagus is not working properly. An ear, nose, throat and/or gastroenterologist doc would be the speciality to rule this out.######suncat: Thanks so much for your reply. I will look into it. It is such a strange feeling i am getting. It makes me very paranoid. Thanks. LaLa.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

Using your inhaler could actually increase your heart rate and induce a panic attack. Many people who experience anxiety and have asthma or other breathing related problems will confuse anxiety and panic attacks with this, not getting to the real source. Speak to your doctor and see if you could try anti-anxiety medications (the ones that are not addictive) and possibly some therapy to learn coping skills and diversion activities to help reduce this. If you find the source, you may not have to worry about the symptoms anymore.######When you start to get the feeling of Panic attack, do n't let your mind run with it. I say to my self, stop this i am fine, relax, go some where calm in your mind and take slow breathes. If this doe n't work you should seek help asap, and from someone that is a specialist. . Asthma drugs like prednisone make you feel really spacey and can cause panic attacks.

I woke up and started having a hard time breathing, then my heart started feeling weird like it feels literally like it is going to stop all the time. I get funny movements i guess in my chest along with the palps (i have mvp) and my heart will beat very fast if i stand up or move too fastThen i started getting dizzy all the time and shortness of breath. It was n't like i was having a hard time breathing just shortness. Now i have like a lump in my throat and i get bubbles in the base of my throat. I was for a while getting left arm, neck, and back pain. Now I 'm still breathing funny like sometimes i feel like i ca n't get a deep breath or sometimes i seem to breath out too much and have to breath deep again. Sometimes when i breath out it feels like im not going to be able to breath again. And there are days where i just ca n't seem to get out of bed cause i feel soo horrible or like my heart is just going to stop I have been to the ER quite a few times and everything comes back normal except that i had low potassuim. Im afraid they are not seeing something. I had an EKG and they always come back normal so i had a holter and they said they saw arrythmias (not dangerous) and rapid heart beat. I do n't know now they tell me its just anxiety but im not convinced.Also im always cold and i know that seems odd but i live in south florida and even when its 75 out i seem to still be chilled I do n't know if that has something to do with it. And when i stand up my chest feels heavy like my heart and lungs are being pulled down I soo afraid im going to just have a heart attack or sudden cardiac death or something. I dont know if im having symptoms of a heart attack or blocked artery or what. Im 22 btw. Can someone help me with this? Thanks Tara p.s. sorry so long######Tara, Sorry to hear that you are feeling this way. What you have wrote does sound a lot like anxiety. I have had anxiety for years. At night I get the same thing where it feels like I stop breathing, fast heart rate, feeling chilled (I live in New Jersey, So I am cold 24-7). lump in throat, And all of this started when I was your age I am now 34. I am on Paxil and it has done wonders. I would try to change your diet, find some time for yourself to try to relax. If you still feel uneasy go to your doctor and have she/he run more blood work for thyroid problems. I hope this helps somewhat. . You will be Ok######Hi Mom, could you tell me how much Paxil you take? I tried it one time and it did great for 3 weeks anf then I started getting severe heart palpitations. I need to be on something now as I have heart disease and I am anxious about it all the time. Tara, I have had exactly what you are talking about. When reading this, I thought I wrote the story. Have your doctor give you an Event Monitor. This you will have for days/weeks and it will record what is going on with your heart and whether it is something to be concerned about. A 24 hour monitor does not always tell the story. An Event monitor does most of the time. Good Luck. Lisa######Lisa, Hi, I take 15mg a day. It is funny that you mentioned getting severe heart papitations while on paxil because ever since I have been taking this med (about 6 years). I have had heart Palps. I have asked the cardo about if there was a link between the heart Palps and Paxil and he said, No. No studies have shown it. I sometimes wonder if that is really the case. I do take a low dose of it... so Who knows ???? Try another brand, they have so many now that really helps... Good Luck######Hi! I am so glad you posted. I have been having exactly the same symptoms along with a tightness in my chest when I am short of breath for about three months now. I am not anxious- a bit frustrated because this is really interfering with my life and ability to do things- but not anxious. Please let me know if you find out anything. So far I have had an event recorder, which showed runs of SVT but not a major problem. I had a negative chest x-ray, EKG, and stress test (of course I was n't symptomatic on any of these days). For me the symptoms seem to last for about a week or so and then go away for a week or so. I am keeping a diary of symptoms to try to figure out some sort of pattern. The palpitations I can live with, but the shortness of breath is really incapacitating. It 's like you said- I 'm not breathing heavy or gasping for air- there is just a really strong sensation that I 'm not getting enough air (I yawn a lot too). My symptoms get better when I rest, but I ca n't do that all day! I want my life back !!! The only test that came back abnormal was I was hypothyroid. I 've been on Synthroid for years and they increased my dose. I go for blood work next week to see if it 's improved, but my symptoms have n't changed so I do n't know if its related at all. I 'm not sure where to turn next. Again, please let me know if you find out anything- we ca n't both be crazy !!! CTMom############Hi Mike, Ryan's Mom... I did find in some literature that Paxil can cause palpitations. I was on 5mg. for one week and then 10 mg. for two more weeks and these palpitatons drove me nutty. I have a friend that is on 20mg and has been for 5 years and no problems. She said she will go to her grave taking Paxil. I asked for Prozac and the doctor said he does not like prozac. Maybe I will ask for Zoloft as this is in the same family. Doe n't Paxil come in XL? Thanks for replying back to me.

You ca n't see the scars from those, but the one where my gallbladder came out has left a tiny scar.

I am not circumcised and my penis has always been pink/red but the edges and back is a slightly different color- a darker (gray, almost light purple), which I do n't think is normal. The most distressing thing is that it is very sensitive to touch, so much so that it 's painful to touch, stroke, even wipe with a towel or a tissue. It has been like this for as long as I can remember, I thought it was normal before but as I got older I realized that sex is n't meant to be painful. I 'm still a virgin but given the soreness when I touch my penis, I 'd expect sex to be even more painful. The soreness seems to occur only with contact with something other than foreskin, when the skin of the penis ``sticks '' to the finger/tissue/towel and hurts when it is pulled away. There are also a few very small bumps (some red, some white) around the edges and the back, which I 'd guess to be pearly penile papules. I have been doing a little research on the net and have deducted that I do n't have phimosis (I hope!) or an STD (you ca n't get an STD without having sex, right?) . My two main concerns are either yeast infection or male thrush, but is it possible for these to be contracted and continue to take effect for years on end? I 've tried to be as hygienic as possible but it does n't seem to be having much of an effect, nothing seems to be changing. Hopefully one of you can correctly diagnose me and point me in the right direction please?######Help? Anyone? ...######The penis comes in many colors and shades, and even the gray purple is normal, as my boyfriends penis has areas that are this color when erect. Basically you should be able to tell if the redness is soreness or just red coloring! With regards to the sensitivity, well again this is normall- as an uncut man you would not expect to be able to rub a towell over your glans without feeling it, and as you say if it sticks this is painful. It would be! Bear in mind that pain is very close to pleasure, and that normal sensations that a guy would expect from his glans depend on how much the glans has been exposed to the rough and tumble of life, and how much it is used to being rubbed, touched, caressed etc.. You may find that you can get much better feelings from your glans if you use some lube such as KY or vaseline (dont use vaseline with condoms, as they will rot them faster than you can say snap). Try this to see if you can actually get used to touching your glans, and this will help you to get used to feeling what it is like and hopefully being able to enjoy those feelings. And no, I woulodnt expect a towell rubbed over it to feel that nice if you are so sensitive but some people would enjoy that feeling- its just folk!.######-Men###-Sexual Health- Men

My question is: my doctor did n't do any swabs or blood tests. she simply looked at it and told me i have a viral infection. i had to continue asking her if i had an std and then she told me ``yes. . you have herpes ''. should n't there be a test done before? or is it possible to diagnose by just looking? are there any chances she was wrong? is it true that most people with herpes have hiv?.######-Infectious Diseases Board###-Herpes

I 'm going as a last resort for depression and OCD that I 've had for quite a few years (I 'm only 20). I was hoping someone could let me know what to expect at a first appointment like this. I figure there will be testing and stuff, but I was wondering what kind of questions and stuff they might ask. I also wondered if they actually diagnose you that day and start meds that fast. If anyone could maybe tell me about their first experience or just what to expect I would really appreciate it. Thanks !!######Nicci, From my experiances no two doctors are the same. But usually they just ask you questions like what are your symptoms, and other general questions. The doctor needs to get to know you too. It 's not that bad, just keep up a good attitude about it and all will be fine.######They usually will ask you about what triggered your illness, how it affects you now, and does your family have a history of mental illness. It depends on the doctor if they want to label you right away. I do n't see why they would n't start you on meds the first day. That 's great that you 're getting help. I hope you will get the help you need.######Did you go to your appointment yet? Interested to hear about your experiences. My first appointment pdoc went down a checklist, gave mr a prescription and sent me home. take care trg247######My first appt. was spent talking to a lady that did an intake. She asked me questions, much like the other posters said. When when she was done, she decided if I needed to see a psychiatrist that day or if I could wait. Thank God I got to see on that day. He talked to me and asked a lot more questions, and sent me home with an antidepressant and xanax for the anxiety. I still see him to this day. I trust him and I think that counts. Good Luck! ... WW######They 'll start off by taking several very painful blood samples, after which they will do electroshock therapy and nearly 2 hours of what they call ``cognative therapy, '' really nothing more than berating you and telling you the depression is all your fault. Do n't believe anything I just said, I am only kidding. Really, there will be a lot of questions. Just answer them honestly. Also, bring a list of current medications you are taking (including vitamins supplements). They may start you on a medication that day if they feel you will benefit from one. Good luck. Keep us posted.######My appointment's tomorrow. I 've been waiting so long for relief, but I 'm terrified of going. I 'll update after tomorrow.

HOLY COW. We 're finally getting somewhere I think! I 'm in shock. . total shock. I do n't know if you remember me, but I 've posted here a couple times before concerning my ongoing problems over the last few years. I 've had quite a few problems, mostly with pain and stiffness, numbness and tingling, etc.. Well over the last few days I 've had this really painful burning sensation in my arms and legs. . it 's so bad that it hurts for even a light breeze to blow across them. My husband finally gave in and called my doctor this morning (I 've just gotten sick of dealing with docs altogether). . basically told them that something HAS to be done now, and let them know what 's going on with the burning and the past numbness and all. Well, the nurse he spoke to talked to my doctor for a while and then called him back. They 're really concerned about the numbness and burning and want me to start being monitored for MS asap including having a brain MRI done. Again, HOLY COW. I 've been to one neurologist, back when all this first started. . and treated like I was insane. He shrugged me off and told me that I was depressed. He did n't do any tests or anything, just had me push up on his hands, etc.. then sent me on my way. I never went back. So here's where I get concerned. What should I REALLY expect with this neurologist? If they 're seriously trying to diagnose or rule out MS, what has to be done? Is there a certain protocol that they follow? Thanks######This first step is usually an MRI- try and get them to do both the brain and the spine at the same time- to save time. Also they should take blood to check for other things- low B 12 levels, lupus, lymes etc.. If lesions are shown on the MRI then an spinal tap might be the next step and possibly an ``evoked potentials '' test. I 'm going through all of this right now- not dxed yet. My MRI showed some lesions, spine is clean. . getting the tap in a few weeks then the evoked potentials test a few weeks after that. From what I have learned from dealing with my Neuro and reading on these boards is that sometimes it can take months and years to get a dx. I have that burning hypersensative skin thing as well. . do n't like it one bit. . almost like you feel burned and chilled at the same time. . like a sunburn. do some searches on the boards- great resource as far as what to expect and what tests are done. take care######Thank you baddoey Are there any certain questions I need to ask ?? It 's just been so long that I 've had problems. . the only SPECIFIC things they 've looked for is Lyme and Lupus. That 's it. I 'm still not convinced that I do n't have Lyme. . I was bitten by a tick a little over 4 years and got the rash and everything, but was never tested back then. I was tested not too long ago but since only one band showed up positive, they would n't diagnose it..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Neurology

I 've had two (where I was conscious, at least) by two different doctors. Both times jelly was applied to the area, there is a spray of very cold water when the scope is inserted that might make you jump a little (I never did ask the reason for that), but otherwise I did n't feel any discomfort at all. There was no prep for the exam... you just have to lie back in the stirrups. Afterward, the first couple of times you urinate there could be a little blood and it will probably sting tremendously... but just the first time or two.######I had my done about a month ago. I was put completely asleep... It was great. It stings a bit when you get up, but I felt better in a hour or two. There is some little bleeding for a day or two. My urologist suspected I had Interstitial cystitis. That is why they put me to sleep. People who have this CAN NOT have this procedure done without being put to sleep. They can not withstand the pain... His diagnose was correct. I have IC and I ``m on therapy. If your doctor suspect you have IC make sure he puts you to sleep... You 'll be really glad he did.

At first I thought I had a UTI but now I definately think it 's a recurring yeast. It started out with just some light itching every now and then and now the itching is pretty consistant. Also not long ago when me and my boyfriend were doing things before the itching got much worse he was like ``Wow your discharge is completely white. '' and since then it still has been totally white. So I 'm definately thinking this is another yeast infection. My symptoms are n't quite as severe as last time though. This time there 's no yeast rash or anything, it got pretty bad last time being untreated so long, and the itching actually feels like it 's actually like inside of me which I did n't see as much last time. I definately do n't want to waste any time. . I want this thing gone. going two months with no treatment was really no fun. But I talked to my mom and she does n't have enough money to take me to a gyn right now... i 'd have to wait almost a month and I 'm really not willing to go through that again.

Thanks, Andy######Hello Andy, I have personally never used the sinus buster but my doctor did prescibe me something called sinus dynamics. It has worked incredibly and it so easy to use. Good luck with your search.######Yeah, I use Sinus Buster. Once I got used to the burn, it has become a godsend. I use two squirts in each nostril in the morning, and one squirt every 4-6 hours after that. It basically creates an irrigation system out of your own mucuous, and the result is astounding. I 'm experiencing allergy relief for the first time in my life. My problems had more to do with rhinitis than sinusitis.######I HAVE ALSO TRIED THIS PRODUCT WHEN I CAME BACK FROM THE ENT YESTERDAY AND GOT NOTHING BUT A SCHEDULE FOR A CT SCAN A WEEK AWAY AND FOLLOW UP WITH HIM 2 WEEKS AWAY... I HAD RUN ACROSS THIS FORUM MENTIONING THIS SPRAY AND FIGURED I WOULD GIVE IT A TRY... KNOWING I COULD NOT WAIT A WEEK TILL I FOUND OUT IF I HAD A SINUS INFECTION, I HAD TO AT LEAST TRY IT... I FEEL LIKE I WILL BE HEADING TOWARD NASAL SURGERY FOR DEVIATED SEPTUM... HOWEVER, THIS SPRAY HAS CLEARED UP MY BIGGEST SPOT OF BLOCKAGE, UP NEAR WHERE THE DEVIATION IS... ALSO, IT ALLOWED ME TO BE IN THE AC WITHOUT GETTING IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED... I WANT TO CONTINUE THE PRODUCT TILL I CAN SORT OUT THE ISSUE OF SURGERY... HOWEVER, I AM JUST WONDERING IF THE CONTENTS OF THIS SPRAY WILL DO LONG TERM DAMAGE TO SENSITIVE TISSUE? HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS RESULT WITH SINUS BUSTER? AND WHAT ABOUT LONG TERM USE?######I just ordered some today so i 'll let you know what the results are when i try it.######Well i 've been using it for several days and thh results are mixed. It does seem to offer some relief when i use it but it 'd made no difference to the sinusitis overall; that still gets worse on a daily basis. For what it cost plus shipping i would n't buy it again but might try sinol instead if anything. I 'm waiting for something called a saltpipe at the moment which is supposed to be amazing for all sorts of respiratory conditions so i 'll see if that has any impact on my symptoms. Watch this space.######I 've had sinus problems since I was a kid do, mostly, to allergies. Over the years I 've tried a number of different products with the last being cortisone-based sprays. After a year or so even they stopped working. About 5 years ago I began using Sinus Buster. At first the `burn ' was pretty rough. After I got used to it I found the results were excellent. Best of all, the product continues to work. It has n't lost its effectiveness over the years. My only gripe is that the product no longer comes in the original spray bottle- only the metered dose.######How long does the metered dose last? The spray i got is nearly gone in two weeks and that 's not eve nusing it all the time. I would be spending Â# 35 a month for saome mild relief and it 's just not worth it. I wonder if the metered dose would last longer. Of course the causes and what works are different for most people and if i 'd have had better results i would n't be complaining. Anyway the saltpipe has helped with the fatigue and breathing but had no effect on the sinusitis so far but i 've only been using it two days. I felt the benefit straight away with the fatigue and my breathing is gradually improving. One thing worth mentioning is that you can use saltpipes nasally as well for sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. At the very least it 's going to clean my lungs out and counteract the effects of pollution where i live (apparently it 's the second worst in the uk) and for that alone it was worth it.######departed, I too experience fatigue, could you describe yours? and how do you use a saltpipe? where is it found? thanks... dr's say fatigue is not a symptom of sinus issues... which makes it even harder to get treatment here############Use Sinol Nasal Spray, available at Rite Aid. It also ultizes capsaicin but is much easier to use. Website is very impressive and have many doctors and clinical trials behind them. I have been using it for 16 months and I am a new woman, love it !!######Capsaicin is the same stuff that is used in Pepper Spray, carried by Police and Military.######Steer clear of this product !!! Honestly, it is one of the most painful experiences to spray this in your nose. IT SEVERLY BURNS YOUR NASAL CAVITY !!! . Any benefit it provides (which is little in my opinion) is FAR outweighed by the extreme pain. No joke, it 's pepper spray up your nose. Dumb idea for a product.######I have n't used this stuff in years. The first time I took it, it was one of the most painful 5 seconds in my life. But then I got used to it. I had headaches all the time and this only provided temporary relief and it was getting expensive to use it everyday. I went through two bottles very quickly. I went to a chiropractor and he discovered that my neck and back was out of alignment and causing my headaches. After some treatment from the chiropractor, I never had to use sinus buster again! I would n't recommend sinus buster as a permanent, long-term solution to your sinus/headache problems. I would only recommend it for the occasional sinus/headache sufferer. There are more practical solutions out there and you ca n't be dependent on sinus buster for the rest of your life.######Sinus Buster just issued results from a rigorous clinical study run at a leading medical research facility. It apparently worked incredibly well agaist congestion and sinus pain. And completely safe. No rebound. Do not accept any knock off capcaicin products with similar sounding names like the one mentioed above. It is definitely not the same !!!######Thanks to everyone. I jotted down all your suggestions. My ent will not give me anything else. He said there is nothing else out there. He has written me a prescription for everything possible. Pills, sprays, etc.. Nothing works. I get 2 allergy shots each week, allergy pillow cases, cleaned my ductwork, got new carpet, nettie pot, all OTC medicines, saline sprays. I sleep in an upright position. I am excited to have maybe have found a solution.######JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN AS A LONG SUFFERING SINUSITIS CASE. I TRIED SINUS BUSTER... PAINFUL AND REALLY NO HELP. I EAT CAPSICAIN, DRINK IT BUT NOT OF ANY BIG HELP. I SEE OTHER CAPSICAIN SINUS FORMULAS SUCH AS DR. SCHULZE'S BUT HAVE N'T TRIED. I 'M SCHEDULED FOR FESS SURGERY AND HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING SO SEVERE. WISH THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE. SO MANY OTHER PRODUCTS OUT THERE. I KEEP TRYING THEM AND RESEARCHING. GOOD LUCK######I have just started using the Sinus Buster which I bought at Rite Aid for about$ 15. I have had chronic sinusitis for about 25 years and had surgery which was of no benefit. I dont know about long range effects but the sinus buster has helped me tremendously already. I breathe easier with little sinus congestion. I was having a lot of bloody mucous and no more of that so far either. I plan to continue using this. I can tolerate the short burning sensation in my nasal passages when I first use it because it doesnt last long and is so worth it!######Sinus buster did not help me. I even bought casicain oil and made my own spray... ouch! But still no relief. good luck. I 'm scheduled for surgery... uuugh######I ca n't believe this would be a good thing to put in your nose! I have chronic sinusitis-- the drainage feels like a lump in my throast. Most of my life. No allergies. Two yrs ago I had surgery to remove a cyst filling most of the maxilarry sinus, causing blockage and infection because things could n't drain. (Though I always felt I had signs of irritating drainage). Things are better but I feel like the more I use the sinus rinse the more I NEED to use it! What 's that all about?

My right nostril is still very congested. I got these two new sprays- sinus buster- it 's very spicy on the nose. it tingles... i still do n't know if I like it. I used it twice but I 'm kind of afraid of using it again... any experiences with it? - Sinus survival nasal spray- just got that one on the mail. I just used it... I do n't think it helps congestions though... anyone using any of these?######I use something called chromolynn. Dont know if they have it in the usa. Im in canada. The drug is called sodium chromoglycate. It comes in teardrops, nasal spray and neither are perscription. The athsma puffer is perscription though. I use it cause I dont want to use steriods.######I ca n't help much with the 2 new sprays that you are using though, have n't heard or been on them before. There 's another steroid spray, Nasacort AQ. I do n't get much or no benefits from steroid nasal sprays. Have been on the highest dose but still congested. Though I find that the nasal decongestant spray/drop does help, but it ca n't be used too often. Have you taken nasal decongestants before? Maybe you should go and talk to your pharmacist or doctor about the spicy feeling... is it suppose to feel like that? Sprays will take a few weeks to kick in, so if you are using only a few days, maybe you can wait to see. Good luck!######It seems as though you have been experimenting with nasal sprays. When you start mixing things w/o a doctor's advice you could be causing inflammation of the lining of the nose. I have never heard of either spray, but use Flonaise. It has cortisone in it and if indeed you have inflammation should reduce it. On the other hand if you are just spraying stuff up your nose without professional guidance you could be doing more harm than good.######This is a response I posted in another post, but I think it might help you: The problem with Flonase is if you are really congested it does n't get where it needs to be to start working. I would continue to take the Sudaphed to help clear your sinuses. Also, here is what I do to get the most out of the Flonase. Take a shower, this will help clear your sinuses. Then use a saliene nosespray, (I use ENTsol) and blow your nose. This will help get some of the gunk out. When you use your flonase keep your chin down on your chest and look down at your feet. Think of aiming the flonase towards your ear when you squirt it in. Do your first squirts, then wait 1-2 minutes then do the second squirt. This will allow the first squirt to work and help get the second one further into your nose. All of these steps were recommended by my allergist. Before he told me this, I never felt flonase worked that great. Now I think of it as a minor miracle. If you have congestion, my doc says using Flonase is like putting water on oil, it does n't get to where it needs to be. These steps will help!######I have never had anyone really tell me how to squirt the Flonaise up my nose... I am going to try this to determine if it makes things work any better. Thanks for the tip!.######-Health Issues###-Allergies

Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated.I love this girl more than i 've ever loved anyone and we have soo much in common, we rly get on great most of the time.I 'm not about to end things with her just because the relationship ai n't going to be dandy all the time.Thanks for your time.######Be prepared because Bipolar is real hard to deal with.

I have noticed for about 2 mos, that when i first went to see my PCP for buzzing in my ear, that my BP was high... now my PCP is my employer too, well used to be. And he siad the buzzing in my ear was due to allergies acting up, which when he gave me the meds stopped the buzzing. but when i saw my ortho last week my bp was up again or still ?? and i have been having on and off buzzing in my ear but i thought bc of the weather change that it was the allergies again. And then when i had my procedure done on Monday it was up all through the procedure and even after it. I have never been nervous enough to make my Bp high. . i mean i work in the hosp and see docs evrvy day so its not beig nervous ??

He talks about the challenges of treating hypertension in people with CKD and hypertension in general. I find this article very interesting. Among other things, he says that the most common cause of resistant hypertension in people with normal kidney function is a failure to use adequate diuretics, or any at all. He also explains how taking medications at night affects dipping patterns and other related issues in dippers and non-dippers with CKD and describes hypertension treatment thresholds for various groups of patients, as well as how the treatment guidelines are starting to reflect the evidence from clinical trials and are being adjusted upward for certain patient groups. He says that hypertension and high blood pressure are not the same thing. Hypertension is a genetic disease where elevations in blood pressure occur at an early age, either brought about by renal or hormonal issues or not, while elevations in blood pressure that fluctuate are causes by a whole spectrum of events that occur over a day and does not necessarily equal hypertension. I have always thought that hypertension and high blood pressure meant the same thing, not realizing that there WAS a difference. flowergirl######To me High Blood Pressure is Hypertension is High Blood Pressure is Hypertension. Both terms still equate to a higher than healthy level of blood pressure in one's circulatory system. In most cases, the medical industry does n't know the exact causes of higher blood pressure, and the medical industry does n't know how to keep blood pressure down at healthy levels; but the medical industry know how to lower blood pressure, somewhat, thru medications that block or inhibit excessive, damaging hormones. To me, any doctor that blames high blood pressure on heredity or stress or anxiety or panic attacks is just a person who does not know the real reason for the unhealthy blood pressure, but still wants to maintain a professional image.######I agree with you. Those two terms are interchangeable. In my mind, they mean the same thing. However, it was interesting to see this referred to as '' '' `the old school of thought '' '' '' in a couple of texts. This is one definition of hypertension I found: 1. Arterial disease in which chronic high blood pressure is the primary symptom. 2. Abnormally elevated blood pressure. fg######As you posted, high blood pressure can come from arterial disease, in which the circulatory system is plugged up. It makes sense that, if there is a kink or plug in the pipes, the fluid inside the pipes will be under more pressure. The other thing that causes higher blood pressure, in almost all other cases, is the overproduction of body hormones that cause the pipes to constrict, or tighten, or narrow. The medical industry found out that Angiotensin I and II cause the blood vessels to constrict, tighten or narrow. So.... they made meds like Ace Inhibitors and ARBS and Beta Blockers in order to block, or inhibit the metabolism from making too much Angiotensin. The question, therefore, is why is someone's metabolism making too much Angiotensin? I have found four reasons for my metabolism to be making too much Angiotensin. When I read about high blood pressure caused by heredity, I say thanks for nothing! Even if true, the high blood pressure is still because the metabolism is producing too much Angiotensin! So... the proper approach to curing an individual's high blood pressure is to target that individual's metabolism, in order to make the metabolism as healthy as possible, IMHO..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Hypertension is derived from two root words; Hyper meaning High and Tension meaning Pressure. Hypertension simply means high blood pressure. Pressure is the force generated when the heart contracts and pump blood through the blood vessels that conduct the blood to various parts of the blood. Although hypertension does not mean or result from excessive emotional tension, but evidence shows that stress and emotional tension do cause increase in blood pressure, and if continuous, could be sustained. High blood pressure is therefore generally defined as a blood pressure exceeding 140/90mmHg confirmed on multiple occasions. The top number (140) is called the SYSTOLIC PRESSURE, and it represents the pressure in the blood vessels (arteries) as the heart contracts and pump blood into circulation. The bottom number (90) is called DIASTOLIC PRESSURE, and it represents the pressure in the blood vessels as the heart relaxes after contraction. These figures measured in millimeters of Mercury (mmHg) reflect the highest and lowest pressures the heart and blood vessels are exposed to during circulation. The generally accepted normal value for blood pressure is 120/80mmHg. Above this value but less than 140/90mmHg is not considered to be hypertensive yet but signals danger, it is therefore called High normal. An elevation of the blood pressure (Hypertension) increases the risk of developing Heart (Cardiac) diseases such as Heart Failure and Heart attack, Kidney diseases, Vascular diseases like athelosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of blood vessels), Eye damage and Stroke (brain damage). These complications called End organ damage arise as a result of long standing (chronic) hypertension. But victims of hypertension are not aware, at an early stage, that they have the disease, until these complications start appearing. This is because hypertension shows virtually no signs/symptoms at the early stage. For this reason, it is generally referred to as the â$ Silent Killerâ$. The damage caused by hypertension increases in severity as the blood pressure increases. Based on this hypertension can be classified as follows: CATEGORY SYSTOLIC (mmHg) DIASTOLIC (mmHg) Normal Less than 130 Less than 85 High Normal 130 â$ ``139 85 â$ ``89 Mild Hypertension 140 â$ ``159 90 â$ ``99 Moderate Hypertension 160 â$ ``179 100 â$ ``109 Severe Hypertension 180 â$ ``209 110 â$ ``119 Very Severe Hypertension Greater than 210 Greater than 120 BORDERLINE HYPERTENSION. Borderline Hypertension is defined as mildly elevated blood pressure that is found to be higher than 140/90mmHg at some times and lower than that at other times. Patients with borderline value need to have their blood pressure monitored more frequently. They also need to assess end organ damage to be aware of the significance of their hypertension. It should, however, be emphasized that patients with borderline hypertension have a higher tendency to develop a more sustained hypertension as they get older. They stand a modest risk of having heart related diseases. A close monitoring of their blood pressure and lifestyles could be very useful in this regard. WHITE COAT HYPERTENSION A single elevated blood pressure reading in the doctorâ$ s office could be misleading, because the elevation might only be temporary. Evidence over the years has shown that anxiety related to the stress of the examination and fear of the result often result in blood pressure elevation noticed in the doctorâ$ s office only. Infact, it has been suggested that one out of every four persons thought to have mild hypertension, actually may have normal blood pressure outside the physicianâ$ s office. This sort of elevated blood pressure noticed in the physicianâ$ s office is called â$ White Coat Hypertensionâ$. Suggesting that the white coat, symbolic of the physician, induces the patientâ$ s anxiety and a passing increase in blood pressure. Accordingly, monitoring of blood pressure at home, when in a more relaxed state of mind, can provide a more reliable estimate of the frequency and/or consistency of blood pressure changes. WHAT CAUSES HYPERTENSION? The Blood pressure is determined by two major parameters; Cardiac output i.e. the volume of blood pumped by the heart, and the Total peripheral resistance i.e. the resistance of the blood vessels through which blood flows. Hypertension is therefore an end result of either increased force of pumping by the heart, or constriction/narrowing of blood vessels causing increased resistance to blood flow or both. Using the cause of hypertension as a yardstick, two major types of hypertension can be described; Essential Hypertension Secondary hypertension The former also called Primary or Idiopathic hypertension is by far the most prevalent type of hypertension. It accounts for over 90% of all hypertension cases. No clear cut cause (s) can be identified for this type of accommodation, hence the name Idiopathic. The later accounts for less than 10% of all cases. In this case, the hypertension is secondary to an existing abnormality in one or more systems or organs of the body. The most common causes are related to kidney and hormonal problems. The persistent uncontrolled use of contraceptives, especially in females over 35years of age fall under hormonal causes of hypertension. Since no clear-cut cause (s) can be adduce for the most common types of hypertension, as with the case with most non-communicable diseases, we therefore talk in terms of â$ Risk Factorsâ$ and not causes. These Risk Factors are actions/inactions that increases chances of getting a disease. Several researches over the years have shown that some factors are directly or indirectly related to the occurrence of hypertension. Some of the factors include: HEREDITARY: High blood pressure tends to run in some families and races. It is believed that some inherited traits predispose some people to hypertension. For example, high blood pressure tends to be more prevalent in blacks than whites. A family history of hypertension increases one chances of high blood pressure. Regular monitoring of blood pressure becomes very vital. HIGH SALT INTAKE: High intake of Sodium Chloride (table salt) has being linked to high blood pressure. The condition develops mostly in societies or communities that have a fairly high intake of salt, exceeding 5.8 grams daily. In fact, salt intake may be a particularly important factor in relation to essential hypertension that is associated with advancing age, black racial background, hereditary susceptibility, obesity and kidney failure. Research has shown that: a. Rise in blood pressure with age is directly related to increase level of sat intake, especially in blacks. b. People who consume little sodium chloride develop no high blood pressure when they consume more, hypertension appears. c. Increased Sodium is found in the blood vessels and blood of most hypertensives. Cutting down on salt intake is therefore a reasonable step in preventing hypertension OBESITY: A close relationship exists between hypertension and obesity. In fact it is believed that most hypertensives are more than 10% overweight. Fat accumulation in the trunk or abdomen is not only related to hypertension but also to diabetes and hyperlipideamia (excess fat in the body). Obesity can contribute to hypertension in several ways. For one thing, obesity leads to a greater output of blood, because the heart has to pump more blood to supply the excess tissues. The increased cardiac output then can raise the blood pressure. For another thing, obese hypertensive individuals have a greater stiffness (resistance) in the peripheral arteries throughout the body. Finally, obesity may be associated with a tendency for the kidneys to retain salt in the body. Weight loss may help reverse problems related to obesity while also lowering blood pressure. It has been estimated that the blood pressure can be decreased 0.32 mmHg for every 1kg (2.2 pounds) of weight loss. The International standard for measuring overweight and obesity is based on a value called BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). This value is derived by dividing the body weight (in Kilograms) by the square of height (in Metres). i.e. BMI = Body weight (Kg) Height2 (Metres). Note: 1ft = 0.305 metres. For adults, a BMI less than 25kg/m2 is preferred. 25 â$ ``29kg/m2 is considered overweight and above 30kg/m2 is Obesity. LACK OF EXERCISE: Sedentary normal individuals have a 20 â$ ``50% higher risk of developing hypertension when compared to very active individuals. Exercise lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. For example dynamic exercises such as brisk walking or jogging, swimming or bicycle ridding for 30 â$ ``45mins daily or 3-5times a week may lower blood pressure by as much as 5 â$ ``15mmHg. Moreover, there appears to be a relationship between the amount of exercise and the degree to which blood pressure is lowered. Thus, to a point, the more you exercise, the more you lower your blood pressure. Provided you do not over strain yourself. Normally, a particularly type of exercise is started, and gradually built up to a satisfactory level over time. Regular exercise reduces blood pressure, burn out unnecessarily fat and also makes the body healthier. ALCOHOL AND SMOKING: These two constitute the social factors most related to high blood pressure. People who drink alcohol excessively (over two drinks per day) have a one and half to two times increase in the frequency of hypertension. The association between alcohol and high blood pressure becomes particularly noticeable when the alcohol intake exceeds the above per day. Moreover, the connection is a dose related phenomenon. In other words, the more alcohol consumed, the stronger the chances of hypertension. This, probably will explain the prevalence of hypertension in populations where alcohol consumption is a habit. Although smoking increases the risk of vascular complications (for example, heart diseases and stroke) in people who already have hypertension, it can not be directly linked with increase in the development of hypertension. Nevertheless, smoking a cigarette can repeatedly produce an immediate, temporary rise in blood pressure of 5 â$ ``10mmHg, but a permanent increase can not be established. However, it is known that some substances in cigarette, e.g. nicotine, alters the composition of the blood and also affects the blood vessels. Smoking and alcohol control are integral part of any effort towards the primary control of cardiovascular diseases in any population. STRESS: Although the role of stress and other emotional factors in hypertension is difficult to define. However, it is known that stress causes a physiological rise in blood pressure and this could be sustained if the stress becomes chronic (prolonged). A STICH IN TIME Since lifestyle components such as dietary patterns, obesity, physical activity, alcohol and smoking have been recognized as important risk factors, steps to reduce the occurrence of hypertension or to alleviate the condition (for those who are hypertensives) should involve lifestyle modification. Dietary modifications include restricting salt intake cutting down or cutting out alcohol, reduced fat consumption, and reducing weight if overweight. The American Heart Association recommends a daily consumption of less than 6grams of table salt for normal individuals, and less than 4grams for hypertensives. A regular exercise program such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling e.t.c. for 30 â$ ``45mins daily or 3â$ ``5 times a week could be very helpful. Conclusively, it is very important to remember that the only way to know if oneâ$ s blood pressure is on the high side is by taking your blood pressure frequently. Normally, your doctor would do that for you. But for a more consistent and reliable monitor of blood pressure, a self-operated blood pressure monitor is crucial. Being very handy and always around, it allows you to follow up your blood pressure regularly and report an increase immediately. Finally, always remember the WHO slogan â$ Know your Blood Pressure, if itâ$ s high have it treatedâ$. A healthy Heart adds life to years. A stitch in time, they say, saves nine..######-Conditions and Diseases###-High Blood Pressure and Hypertension

The doctor told her what her life expectancy is and she has been down ever since. He said that she would live to 60 (or 40 if she did n't take the medication). Now she is a alcoholic and smokes and does a lot of things that create hypertension or are not good for it. She is also very upset about not being able to have children because of the condition and medication. I want to know if there 's been any advancements in this area and how do I find out. Or what can I say to her to keep her positive? She 's really bad on the alcohol now. Can she do the surrogate mother thing- or does the medication affect the eggs ??? Is there anyone else that knows of people with similar stories?######Is high blood pressure all she has?######While the hypertension is an issue, there is the alcoholism which will be damaging her liver, and yes there are those who wear their's out by age forty. Number one getting pregnant while using alcohol can cause harm to the baby, number two getting pregnant while smoking can cause harm to the baby. Then there is the risk of bringing a baby into a home with an active alcoholic. (We do n't have children now because my husband is an alcoholic, now sober, but when he was actively drinking for the first 15 years of our marriage the situation was not one I was willing to bring a baby into no matter how much I wanted one.) There are other antihypertensive drugs she could possibly take, so I think that might be a concern she should take up with the physician. But if the other two issues were to be addressed, the blood pressure medicine may no longer be needed..######-Conditions and Diseases###-High Blood Pressure and Hypertension

This coincides with her being placed on Amlodipine 2.5 mg for her hypertension. I have read that this is a fairly common side-effect of this drug in women of her age. she is 68. Can someone help me understand the reasons why she owuld have been placed on this specific kind of hypertension med (calcium blocker) versus others? and if I was to ask for her to be changed to something else what would be a decent suggestion? We have been thinking this is early onset Alzheimer's but her brain scans and other tests have been ``unremarkable '' Thanks######dbaygeorges, Without knowing your mother's medical history, it is not possible to determine why she was placed on this medicine. But, in general, Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, Amlodipine relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload. Thus, calcium channel blockers are often selected for patients who have hypertension and chest pain (from coronary heart disease). Actually, loss of memory is listed as a rare side effect, but if it occurs, it warrants being looked into. As to what to change your mother to, would have to be up to her physician. Without knowing her other medical problems, it is impossible to recommend a specific treatment. Speak with her physician, explaining that you are concerned about her memory loss, that it coincided with her starting the Amlodipine, and that you would like to know if it would be better to switch her to a different class of antihypertensives. Good luck. Hope your mother feels better soon..######-General Forum Topics###-Pharmaceuticals

First of all Acute HIV infection does not mean that you are Seroconverting in the sense that when we say seroconversion means when we start to develop antibodies. This is what i read. ``A person may, or may not, show positive on the test during (or shortly after) the Acute Viral Syndrome.Many people will start producing antibodies after the Acute Viral Syndrome (AFTER), but I can not say if most people will be antibody positive 10 days after this syndrome ''. So is it that if someone has an Acute HIV infection it makes them different from the the person who did not develop these bad sysmptoms. In Terms of Seroconversion timing with us saying how 8 weeks is a sufficent indication since Acute HIV infection symptoms can last longer any we may not show positive untill the acute stage is gone. Which i understand can be past the 12 week before antibody detection. 1. so if i have an Acute HIV infection. i jus have to wate past the 12 weeks. so my eight week 5 days negative was just encouragement and i am far from out of the wood since i might be experiencing Acute HIV infection. since Antibody production is basically after the infection stage is over (not Saying that we cant develop antibodies wwith in the 12 weeks. but Acute HIV infection may change the timeline of seroconversion and we develop after 12 weeks.) PLZ !!!!! can i get some input Thanks Alot. Does Any of this make sense ????????######Read your first thread my opinion has not changed######Buddy I have read your post 3 times now and no it makes no sense whatsoever. To clarify what is a very simple situation and one you seem intent on complicating. Seroconversion takes, on average, 22 days. Seroconversion is the process of going from HIV negative to HIV positive. After this period an HIV antibody test will detect the presence of HIV antibodies and you will test positive. Given the fact you have had an HIV antibody test at 8 weeks (56 day, nearly 3 times the average length of time for seroconversion) it is extremely unlikely you will later test positive. Buddy, yes, it really is this simple !! Kevin..######-Sexual Health###-HIV Prevention

Good Luck! SJN######I do n't know about the original poster, but I 'm a male likely with Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) and it is scaring the crap out of me. I 've had a one-time urine sample taken, and it came back positive for porphyria and my symptoms match that of the Acute Intermittent type. I have all of the typical symptoms, and then some, that are outlined by the Porphyria Foundation: \* nausea \* vomiting \* constipation or diarhea \* pain in the back, arms and legs \* muscle weakness (due to effects on nerves supplying the muscles) \* urinary retention \* palpitation (due to a rapid heart rate and often accompanied by increased blood pressure) \* confusion, hallucinations and seizures I know for a male to have this condition, it is quite rare. I plan on getting a lottery ticket since my odds of having it are about 1 in 100,000 or greater. I try to make light of my situation despite the seriousness of it. With my AIP, it was triggered by infections. I was originally diagnosed by mononucleosis back on January 9th due to the symptoms I was exhibiting that were inductive of it. You can read in detail about my original idea of my problem being kidney related here ((url) http://www.healthboards.com/boards/showthread.php?t=401755) (/ url). I had what is now evident as an acute attack on February 2nd, and went to the ER. Then, they did n't find any signs of a kidney stone, treated my pain and sent me home. I had pain for two weeks and missed that much time from work. Things started to seem to get back to normal until May 2nd; three months to the date I had severe upper right quadrant pain. I was rushed to the ER and stayed for four days. They had found I had passed a kidney stone, but could not identify the type or composition of it. After that I soon developed chronic pain that exhibited itself predominantly as flank pain, with pain under the lower two ribs on either side, radiating into the back. During acute attacks it radiates down my legs, and into my arms. With each acute attack, it gets worse. My last visit, which was this past Tuesday night, early Wednesday morning they had a hard time getting my pain under control. They overmedicated me that it depressed my breathing and I had to be put on oxygen. I also, not only from the pain medication, was having hallucinations. With each ER visit, my neuropathy-type symptoms are worse then before, and afterwards the pain in my forearms and elbows gets worse. I was diagnosed last year with the neuropathy in my arms being attributed to my work, since I have a sedentary job working at a computer for eight to ten hours a day, when I can work. As it stands right now, I can not even sit straight up for more then fifteen minutes without having excruciating pain. If it wasn t for my family, I d have been in deep, deep depression over a month ago and given up. I live with chronic pain, usually in the six to seven (on a scale of ten) range. I do not take pain medication, because I do not want to develop a resistance to it, or a false dependency. I want it to be there when I truly need it. Next week I have an appointment with my primary care physician s office to try a regular infusion of ten percent dextrose, to see (if I avoid the ER in the meantime) if it helps with starving off more acute attacks. If not, then despite the risks of taking it, I ll want to try the Panhematin that is available for treatment of AIP patients. What I d like to know is if anyone knows of any alternative treatments for patients of AIP that has relieved some of the chronic pain, if not removing it entirely, or if there are any other treatments besides the regular glucose and Panhematin infusions. Once my other tests come back to confirm the AIP diagnoses, I plan on having a permanent central line port inserted by a general surgeon I was referred too, who suggested I had AIP. The permanent IV line would be to help with the regular infusions, and so I could get them at home. Please, if anyone knows of help or an alternate active online community for porphyric patients let me know. I m practically at my wits end. Thank you for any help, it is greatly appreciated.######Is there anyone here who knows about AIP, or definitive diagnostic tests for it? I 'm so tired about being sick and weak and I want to move on with my life.######Please, if anyone as anything that might help, please let me know!

It all began last Sep 26, I went to Singapore and slept with 4 prositutes. Of course all of them are at different time. A few minutes after another. I used condoms the whole time. At that time, my penis had a tiny sore on the neck. It was an open wound. (It was a tiny pimple-like sore.) When I realized what I have done that night, I could n't go to rest and it kept me stress up till these days. After that incident, 2 days later, I started to have rash and itch all over my body. And it got worse at the end of 2 weeks. I went to the dr. and she said it was just ``dry skin '' problem. However, this problem subsided quickly after that. The next thing I knew, I got sore throat problem, and it had somekind of white pus with it. Basically my throat was all red. I went to the Dr. again an he gave me antibiotic. It gone away after that. However, after a week now, it came back again. The same thing, I went back to the Dr. and he prescribed me the same drugs. At the same time, I am facing with more Acute Viral Syndrome problem (maybe hope not!) , having diarrea, night sweat dry cough. By the way, I have been very anxious and worried about this HIV since that Sep 26. Can this be the reason why I am having these problems due to my worries? I went to check for HIV antibodies test for 3 times now, it was all negative. The last one was today (11 wks) and also negative. I am still very worry, can u help me out. Lot of thanks... Poor me...######Joshua, Get tested again at 3 months. If still negative ask to be tested for other std's. You could have something bacterial like syphilis, chlamdia that will respond to antibiotics.######Joshua, Thanks for your reply, being out of the country always scares you more for some reason. I was in central america and you never know what these girls get into. 11 weeks would deffinently be a good sighn you will test negative for hiv. I have a lot of unfinished root canals no feeling or caps and that has me paranoid even more. I used to be pretty spiritual and then left the church for eight years. I am hopping this is a way to get my attention, God Bless and good luck to you..######-Sexual Health###-HIV Prevention

I 'm trying to take it for the second time. I first tried several months ago, and two weeks into it I noticed that I could not focus on things close up. I realize this is not a vision change that is associated with plaquenil, but it frightened me, and it seemed awfully coincidental. My regular MD thinks it 's vision change due to my age (40), and that my noticing it two weeks into a plaquenil trial was a coincidence. My optometrist thought my eyes looked ok, and I 'm seeing an opthamologist tomorrow. I had a rheumy appt last week, and he said there is nothing about plaquenil that would cause an acute vision change like this. I started taking it again a few days ago, because I think I really need to give it a try, but I feel really paranoid about it. I tend to worry about meds anyway, but the vision thing is especially scary to me. It is also making my stomach queasy. Does that wear off? Any comments about plaquenil would be appreciated. Thanks, Susan.######I give Plaquenil two thumbs up for me! A year ago, I could hardly walk, my legs hurt so bad. I am 33 and I felt 80! It took about 4 months for the full effect, the first few weeks i did get the queasy feelings but it got better. Now I do n't know what I would do without this medicine. Now I can feel my age again! I have SLE with CNS involvement too. But I would say, give it a good try! Do n't give up on it, it may take awhile, but for me it was so well worth it! Especially for the joint and muscle pain! Good luck !!!! Donna######Susan- I 've been on it about a year. Ca n't say I 've noticed any improvement- actually my disease has progressed significantly in the past year. My Rheumy says I would be a lot worse if I were n't taking it. The upset tummy goes away with time-######Plaquenil can affect the eyes. You are supposed to have an eye exam before you go on it and then have followup checkups the whole time you are on it. Look the drug up on the net to learn more. ------------------######Thanks for the replies. I had my eyes dialated yesterday and was told that they look fine. I 'm going to continue to try the plaquenil, and hope the upset stomach wears off soon. susan######Susan- When you start it, ask your doc if it 's ok if you step up dosage slowly since the upset tummy was a problem before- made it a lot easier on some other meds I was on. Keep us posted- and good luck.######I 've used Plaquenil for three years now. Yes, there is blurring of vision. My eyes are checked every six months by an eye doctor. He says there is no reason for the blurry vision but, it is present. I now take the meds at night before going to bed and this seems to eliminate a lot of the daytime blurring. When I first began taking the med my only problem was itching which stops after awhile. It took eight months for the med to work. I tolerate sun better, muscle spasms lessened, rash cleared up and suffer less fatigue. Once I stoped taking the meds because I was fed up, four days later I could barely sit up. Everyones experience will be different. All the best to you!######I just posted a question in regards to vision. Similar to your experience. However, I could not see upclose and later had it clear up before I was prescribed that medication. I have been tring to find out if this changing vision has anything to do with lupus. Hope this helps. ------------------######I 've heard lots of good things about plaquenil. I 'm sorry it has not helped you. Do you think it may be because you are using it in combination of other meds. I 'm not sure if that is possible, just thinking out loud. I 'll be starting on plaquenil in about 2 months just about the time my prednisone is wearing low and at my 6th cytoxan treatment. Good Luck######I took Plaq. for a year and it did n't seem to help me at all. But... My eyes are still not at all what they used to be. I wake up with puffy, red eyes, do n't think it was the Plaq. though, just age (48) and eye strain from being on the computer to much! It could also be because of high blood pressure and I also need to get a fasting glucose. As far as Plaq messing your eyes up... it 's a chance in a million. Kim######I was initially frustrated with the Plaquenil because it took SIX MONTHS before I noticed any improvement. But, I 'm so glad I did n't give up. Not including the short time it took for my stomach to get used to the medication, I have n't had any side effects. My flares are a fraction of what they were and it is the ONLY thing that has made a dent in the constant fatigue. Give it time and do n't give up.######I tried Plaquinil for a year. I do remember that I had to have my eyes checked before taking it tho... I just could n't take it because it made me so sick... I mean really sick. I tried to take it after eating, before eating and during eating... Nothing worked and it made me so sick that we finally gave up on it. I feel like I gave it a fair chance too. Good luck to you and I hope your nausea goes away soon..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Lupus

I began to think it would never go away, but it finally did. 2 weeks ago I was again sick for about 5 days and then got better (btw, the symptoms were more acute this time). since then my nose is clogged up, I cough and I have a headache. it 's not as bad as when I was really sick but I do feel tired and generally like I 'm still a little bit sick (which I did n't feel the other times I was sick after I got better). I do n't want it to drag on for 2 months again like last time. what should I do? I should probably note that I move around quite a bit, and at the moment I 'm in Vietnam (and I was here when I got sick this time, but not the last time). it probably sound significant but I doubt it, because my symptoms are generally very similar every time I get sick, including this time. only this time it feels stronger. thanks######Hello and thank you for posting your medical question on E health Forum. From the history provided it seems that you might be having sinusitis, infection of the paranasal sinuses. You can take OTC medications like Ibuprofen for a few days to allow the inflammation and cellulitis to subside and antihistamines like clarinex might reduce the runny nose. In addition, decongestants and mucolytic agents can help too. If the condition does not improve, you might consult a doctor for prescription of antibiotics for treating the infection. I hope this helps..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Cold, Flu and Viral Infections

Approximately 8 days after I got extremely weak, fatigued and was close to limping because it hurt to walk. Im from the east coast so I deal with cold weather constantly- Im on the run due to my job and fly alot. My muscles were weak but I felt a little bit better after getting some rest. Panicing I contacted the person I had the encounter with and he told me not to worry. Later that week, he sent me rapid test results that were negative, but I know Im not the only one he sleeps with. Come that weekend, about 2 weeks after the encounter, I started to feel extremely guilty about what I did and started looking things up. I came across acute hiv and literally had a panic attack, for about a 4 day period, I couldnt eat anything, vomiting, loose stools- felt burning hot but never had a fever. I went to work that Monday- but ended up leaving because I couldnt stop vomiting. The middle of the week, I developed a sore throat and something close to oral thrush. It looked more like geographic tongue than anything. I went to a clinic and she said it wasnt thrush, and everything else looked healthy. I 've had somewhat of a sore throat for 2 weeks now, it isnt that bad but its definitely there. I dont cough at all, but I do have post nasal drip. Also I went on vacation this past week to a warmer climate and felt awful the entire time. I experience random muscle aches but overall I 'm ridiculously stressed. All I do is look things up online and scare myself. I look at myself in the mirror 500 times a day and try to find something wrong. I kept looking for a rash and in the middle of the week, about the end of fourth week, I broke out in a rash under my breast. It was small tiny raised bumps that were light in color and it cleared up in less than two days. They didnt itch or anything which matches the description. Right now im starting the 5th week post exposure and I still have a sore throat and some headaches. I never had a fever or swollen glands. I think about this 24/7- I cant focus on anything else. I dreamt about it last night. I dont understand my symptoms, the thrush, the sore throat, the random quick rash, I always have clammy hands, I constantly have my jaw clenched. I cant convince myself otherwise even if he did show me negative rapid test results. Everytime I think Im getting better- something else happens. Please help me. What do you think? Do you think this is acute HIV or ridiculous stress? My friends seem to think its stress but the time frame that all this is happening is pretty scary.######None of those symptoms are exclusive to HIV; most viruses manifest with those symptoms. You probably have something, but I doubt it 's HIV, which is not very easy to transmit through vaginal intercourse, and anyway, your partner's tested negative. Get tested, but seriously... without meaning to sound flip, people sleep with strangers constantly, often without protection, and few of them get HIV. You did something unwise one time. Some people do it four or five times a week for years, and they still do n't get HIV. Give yourself a break. Learn from your mistake and move on. Good luck.######i think your guilty feelings and looking things up has intensified your fears alot. as said above, most likely you are fine. just get tested to be sure and protect yourself in the future. good luck######Well you need to test for HIV and std's. A HIV duo will be conclusive. . To say you have somthing is an open statment for concern, so please ignore that above. Symptoms are speculative but results are conclusive. I cant tell you your status or what you may have, but just that testing will be the thing you need to do.######Her stated symptoms include vomiting, loose stools, thrush, a rash, and a sore throat, weakness and fatigue such that it hurts to walk. missjb10, please do ``ignore '' my statement that you obviously have something. You need to go to the doctor, as you 've probably got some transient viral or bacterial infection, and the amount of vomiting you describe (having to leave work because of vomiting) could be dangerous and you may need electrolyte fluids. I do not believe your symptoms are in any way related to your sexual encounter; I believe you have ``something ''. As in the flu. Or mono. or a host of other infections which present with these symptoms. And I believe you should see a doctor about it. Good luck.######My vomiting lasted only the weekend I looked things up- in the midst of my panic attack- 4 days worth. I do have an appetite now and I 've only gotten nautious once since my vomiting episode which happened two weeks after my original exposure. I 've been to the doctors twice, and they dont think its ARS, they think its ``very unlikely ''. Regardless its still possible. Its the time frame and the continuous symptoms that freak me out. My thrush is gone but my sore throat is still here. Currently, 5 weeks post exposure I just came back to the colder climate and am spending the day inside. I was in warm weather for the past week but my symptoms are still present. My throat is still sore and I 'm now experiencing muscle aches randomly throughout my body, and now my left ear hurts. I also get random headaches and my palms and feet are always clammy/sweaty. My rash is n't irratted anymore and its barely there under my breasts. The bumps were so tiny and raised- ive never had anything like that before so it was odd for me to experience 4 weeks after the fact. Does the ARS rash typically go away within two days? Also I should note I did get the flu shot back in October. I know you can still catch the flu but Ive been sick with weird symptom after symptom which all goes with the time frame of acute hiv infection. I cant stop going crazy over it. I dont know what to do and how to stop linking my problems with those of the acute stage. I pray to god its not- I dont think about anything else during the day. I havent had a fever at all- but when I feel my skin I always feel ridiculously hot.######Miss, ARS rash dosnt come and go that quick, but many people who get HIV dont get a rash. The symptoms you had are typical of over 500 things i could list, thats why nobody can say what you may have. HIV has many non specific symptoms, so its impossible to say or even mention what you may have. As i said before, no doctor can say whats wrong with you unless they check you over in person, not one person can speculate on your HIV status only indicate risk. The internet is renowned for speculation like google, where im guessing you have been looking and so freaking from. Nothing you say will change that fact you need to test for HIV and STD's to be sure of your status and to ease your mind. Some of us have been in your shoes and fully understand your sitauation and how you feel right now. Only testing will end how you feel. A HIV DUO will be conclusive. Have you booked an appt for a HIV test, do you indent to do so?######Agreed. Only testing will relieve your anxiety. I must say, now that I think about it, that I experienced many of the same symptoms you describe while awaiting test results for cancer recently (negative, thank god). Plus I lost eight pounds in a week due to not eating or sleeping, which REALLY convinced me I had cancer, lol. So some of it could be stress-related. And as for the rash, I experienced a similar annoying rash under my breasts a couple of years ago, which freaked me out. I 'd never had anything like it before. I 'd recently bought a new bra, and it turned out I was allergic to it. As soon as I quit wearing it, the rash went away. So you see, your symptoms could be any number of things, and they may not all be related to each other. The vomiting could 've been flu, stress, or food poisoning; the persistent sore throat could be a sinus infection, tonsillitis, or allergies. HIV testing is the only thing that will ease your mind. Good luck.######her symptoms sound nothing like i got when i was infected. they do not sound hiv specific at all just a few of them radomly picked off a list... if someone is waving recient test results around in your face it is highly unlikely you have hiv. please get tested so you can put away your imagination good luck######Sounds like you just have extreme anxiety and that can weaken your immune system. Once that happpens you can get sick with common cold, flu or any other thing that is common. As for going through what you are right now nothing will help your anxiety accept for a conclusive test, which most people will tell you is 3 months. For advice i would say to just ignore it and keep in contact with your doctor, eat healthy, exercise once you feel better and wait for a month or 2 to go have a conclusive antibody test. Feeling that your life is in danger is one of the worst feelings, and for a length of 3 months it can be misery.######I did n't realize you were positive, Smiteler. I thought you were just, like me, someone who had a scare in the past. Given your status, I think it 's doubly admirable for you to spend time here attempting to calm these poor souls. Kudos. I wish you all the best.######Hi there, HIV is diagnosed one way, through an HIV test. I assure you I do fully understand the anxiety you are suffering right now and the stress you are under but please do yourself a huge favor stop trying to self diagnose. I would advise you, if you have done so, to stop goggling '' HIV symptoms '' in a way to try and determine your HIV status. It really is impossible. The symptoms you read on the net are not check list, HIV as no specific symptoms. The symptoms you see are after the event from people who have been tested positive, they are not set in stone. Just because you may have a few of the symptoms of HIV does not mean you will have HIV in the same way just because you may no symptoms does not mean you do not have HIV. Please know this, I did a breakdown of one year in the UK. Of all the people that got tested for HIV over 99% tested negative. That is 99% of people who also believed they had symptoms, felt they needed to get tested, but all tested negative. I can quote you odds and statistics until time ends if you wish but ultimately they do not determine your HIV status, nor do symptoms. Please, when you are advised the amount or lack symptoms you may or may not have can not determine your HIV status it really is true. Here is another list of symptoms for you, maybe you recognize many of them. \* Chest Pain or Palpitations \* Migraine- Frequent Headaches and tension headaches \* Indigestion- (very common physical symptom of stress) \* Nausea \* Heartburn \* Loss of Appetite \* Constipation or Diarrhea \* Flatulence or excessive wind. \* Stomach cramps \* Tremor and shaking and/ or nervous twitches & tapping \* Muscle cramps and spasms \* Rheumatoid arthritis \* Worsening Eczema/ Psoriasis \* Increased sweating \* Baldness or increased hair loss \* Poor circulation with cold fingers and toes \* Infertility \* Menstrual irregularity \* Premature ejaculation or Impotence \* More frequent asthma attacks \* More frequent flu's and colds \* Neck pain & back pain They are the physical symptoms of stress and anxiety. Regards Kevin.######(QUOTE = Kali333; 4689350) I did n't realize you were positive, Smiteler. I thought you were just, like me, someone who had a scare in the past.

Do you actually think that everybody who tests positive as exactly the same symptoms? In answer to this question. People who test positive do not have the exact same symptoms, this is because the symptoms of HIV are non specific. And please lets not let this thread stray any further, ok? Kevin.######i have typed what symptoms i had a million times here before it really does n't matter what they were because i also got infected with spinal meningitis with hiv at the same time and almost died from it. the symptoms can swing to many extremes from near death like me to others who have no idea they have it at all. yes, kali i 'm positive who else would better know what is a risk or not? its not as horrible as many make it out to be but i will say you do n't want it.######Can smiteler tell us what symptoms he had before he tested positive? (/ QUOTE) Poor smit has done this so many times he has to wear plasters on his fingers from the amount of typing he does Also when he does many end up ``beliving '' they have HIV although in no way do they resemble smits situation as his was more extreme due to other health complications. The other and main reason why i dont go on symptoms (to diagnose or indicate a status), is 99% of posters here have them and are negative, myself had all the A typical symptoms and im negative. The other side of the coin is the one person who did become HIV positive here had very few symptoms######in a week at week 6 you can take your 1st test then another one at 3 months dont worry you 'll be fine rash is an immune response to any virus or infection not necessarily hiv######My guess is they are self-induced from stress. It is amazing how the mind and body are linked and what can happen when you torture yourself with thoughts like those... like everyone else says obly way to know is to get tested..######-Sexual Health###-HIV Prevention

This is the first time I 've ever heard anyone make such a statement... is this accurate? He seemed incredibly confident about it. He said the 3 to 6 month period is intended for people who may not have gotten symptoms, or who got symptoms later on (not in the initial two or three weeks), but if you started getting ARS symptoms (which indicates that your body is seroconverting), your test would have come up positive much quicker. This is probably the most reassuring thing I 've heard in a while, assuming it 's true! Does anyone have any feelings or opinions about this? I know the GMHC is one of the leading authorities on HIV/AIDS, so that 's a good sign.######well i guess i am out of the loop. i do n't know what the GMHC is. the only comment i have is that the CDC (Center for Disease Control) still says to test at 90 days. i am sure that is so it covers 99% or so of the exposed individuals. is it possible that a person would show anti-bodies in 8 weeks? yes, it is very possible. but because no one knows for sure how each persons immune system will react time wise, i think the 90 day mark is a great point of refrence. just my 2 cents.######GMHC = Gay Men's Health Crisis. They offer support and information to anyone (straight or gay, man or woman) who is worried about a possible HIV infection, or who has already been tested positive, or even just wants some education.######I would certainly take it as a really good sign that you tested negative at eight weeks. Obviously every person's body is different and some people do develop the antibodies within this time frame. Personally, if I tested negative at eight weeks, I would still return for my 3 month test just to put my own mind at rest. The three month time frame is so commonly referred to that it would still be on my mind to test at 3 months..######-Sexual Health###-HIV Prevention

Two months beforehand, my GP put me on medication in the hopes that it would control... well,. I 'd had a non-epileptic seizure eight months beforehand, and nobody could make any sense of it. So he gave me some pills and told me to tell him how I felt later. On the first day of the conference, I had a major panic attack. Seriously embarassing. I felt my blood sugar dropped to an alarming rate. On Day 2, I was sent to hospital because my blood pressure was all over the shop. The people who were loaning me their guest room over the week could n't get a reading out of me, plus I was pale and weak. (According to the reading on their machines, I should 've been clinically dead.) During my visit to the hospital, the doctor on duty informed me that I was being treated for Addison's Disease- when, in fact, I do n't have this condition at all. So how, I ask, can this doctor justify giving me such drugs in the hopes it would treat? Why would he do that? Would he take other effects into account? (Oh, and for the record, the symptoms have intensified three-fold. I think it 's acute anxiety. So does my counsellor. I 've yet to convince my GP to investigate it further. And I stopped taking the medication two years ago. My GP no longer gives a s \*\*\* about it.)######Bumping it up...!######Sorry, I just do n't want you to go with no response any longer.

I had neck, back and shoulder pain right away, went to minor emergency and my regular doctor. They took xrays which showed nothing broken and prescribed pain pills and relaxers. My doctor hesitated to order an MRI, said to wait two weeks & pain would likely be gone. After seven days I was in much worse pain, so I saw an orthopedic spine doctor. He ordered four weeks of PT 3x per week and continued use of the meds I 'd already been given. At the time I did n't realize he only ordered PT for my neck, so after the first PT visit I had to see him again to have the PT order revised to include back. He commented that I was having spasms and said ``these things just take time ''. I 'm starting my final week of PT tomorrow, and while I have gotten better mobility in my neck since starting PT, the pain has not diminished at all. I ca n't sit for any length of time, same with walking, and lying down is impossible. The neck pain comes and goes, but the pain in my lower back is constant and some days is so bad I am in tears. Is this still normal, or should the pain have subsided at least some by now? I 'm frustrated because I 've never had a day of back or neck pain in my life until now, and now I 've been in constant pain for eight weeks. I do n't handle pain medicine well at all, it either makes me sick to my stomach or makes me a zombie, so I have to limit my medication to ibuprofen during the day. Everyone just keeps saying it takes time, but after eight weeks should n't I feel even a little better? Thanks for any advice and responses, I appreciate it.######Welcome to the board. Unfortunately people and medical personnel tend to think of cervical and whiplash injuries when someone has been in a car crash, too often ignoring that the rest of the spine can suffer damage, too. I understand why doctors are reluctant to order MRIs right off the bat, as often they will indicate a ``problem '' that is actually not really causing any pain or difficulty. The spine begins the degenerative, aging process in our 20s, but most of us do not develop any outward symptoms until many decades later... and at any time beyond the twenties very few people have a MRI that reveals a 100% ``perfect '' spine. However, eight weeks after the accident, if your only injuries were muscular, you should be gradually getting better and the symptoms should be receding. I would suggest you return to your doctor, explain your continuing symptoms and how they are affecting your daily functioning, and ask for a MRI of your lumbar and cervical spine. If you feel your doctor would be reluctant to order this test, make an appointment with a fellowship-trained spine specialist. This can be either an orthopedic spine surgeon or a neurosurgeon who limit their practice to issues of the back and neck. Then you will know what you are dealing with, whether your body can heal properly on its own or whether you need some conservative treatments to help the process along. A patient can waste a lot of time dealing with the PCP and just being treated with a ``wait and see '' attitude. I know I did. Good luck to you.

For the last year my husband has been seeing a neurologist for the following symptoms: legs hurt espec. from knees down, muscles cramp badly at times, twitching of muscles, hands shake, muscle weakness especially in left arm, fatigue, and recently all stopped for 7 weeks, and recently now all started up again in full force along with sweating, vomiting and for about a week and a half continuous shortness of breath. Now, the neurologist has said it may be ALS, since all tests have come back neg., except for a stight elevation in cpk (under 1000) levels. About 4 months ago my husband found out he is pre-diabetic (metabolic syndrome). I wonder if his symptoms could be from the metabolic syndrome... any thoughts? please share. I am desperate for answers and there is no one I can turn to... even the neurologist says wait and see what happens... I do n't want to wait and see if he has ALS I want to find out if there is another cause now! please... any thoughts?######I 'm not an expert on any of this, but due to back problems, diabetes, etc., I have had some whoppers of some leg cramps. Then I looked at my Centrum multivitamin, and it was not giving me squat in the way of Potassium. I have added a banana a day to my diet and have not had a major cramp since I 've been doing it. I also have High Blood Pressure, so you might want to try and rule that out. Sorry I could n't answer more of your questions. jdog.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I had to bite into my hand I was in so much pain. I reached down and it seemed the muscle had balled up (or at least part of it as the ball I felt was maybe 4 inches across) near the top of the muscle. After maybe 20 seconds the balling of the muscle started to subside and the pain dulled but it hurt to do any movement that involved that muscle. When I got up this morning I could put weight on my right leg but I was walking with a limp because I was still in pain when trying to walk but after a trip to the bathroom and back, that also began to subside but has not gone completely and I am still walking with a small limp. I just wondered if this sounds like a minor tearing of the muscle or whether I 've just over-strained the muscle? I 'm not even sure if it was just cramp because the pain seemed far too severe to be cramp... Thanks######Sounds pretty much like a cramp. I 've had them before. It 's best to stand as soon as you wake up and straighten out the leg putting your weight on it. That will pull the cramp out. My calf muscle is usually sore the next day also.######I read a similar post not too long ago about a person who had something similar, although they had been struggling with it for quite some time. It sounds like they were in more pain than a typical ``charlie's horse '' type cramp, which do hurt and you really ca n't move, but they said it was severe enough where they would physically tear up the room (mattress off the bed, etc.). It sounds like it may still be a cramp, but a more severe case. First, have you done any physical activity that may have caused an injury or strain to the muscle? If not, I 'd suggest seeing a doctor for testing to make sure you do n't have any vitamin/nutrient deficiencies. Low potassium can cause muscle cramps, and I am sure there are many other things that can cause them as well. I 'd make sure there is n't any kind of imbalance that you can fix. If it continues to happen, perhaps your doctor can give you some suggestions on good ways to prevent them. Good luck and sorry to hear about this!.######-Health Issues###-General Health

Anyway, I have over the past year been having a horrible problem with anytime I even slightly (and I do mean slightly) excersize my legs, I spend hours on end that evening with the worst cramps ever. I mean I think I would rather go through childbirth again than to get these, they are that painful. It seems that they start either in the top of my ankle (where my foot curves up to my leg) or the right upper side of my calf. Not only that but I have noticed my toes and feet have constant pulling and jerking sensations in them, almost like a pre-cramps that drive me nuts and cause me to constantly jiggle my feet to stop the feeling. I hate that I ca n't even walk around the block or go to the store without paying dearly for it that night. Does anyone have any ideas because I have tried drinking tons of water (my husband thought I might be dehydrated) and even tried upping my salt intake. I just do n't know what to do, but I do know that I ca n't go the rest of my life not walking because i 'll gain a ton of weight just sitting around all the time.######I was suffering from constant leg cramps and a sales rep from the pharmaceutical company I work for told me that her pharmacist had recommended taking two tablespoons of mylanta every day. She did that and has not had leg cramps for two years. I tried it for about two days... And have not had a leg cramp since. I 've stopped taking the mylanta but if I have them again i 've got it on the shelf! This really seems to work! Good luck!######Thanks for the quick reply. Mylanta huh? Would n't that replace the leg cramps with the trots or something along those lines? I mean, i 'd be willing to try it, but I want to make sure i 'm not going to spend every night in the bathroom... Hehe:)######I 've never had any problem with that with mylanta. It 's not a laxative... It 's used mainly for indigestion just like maalox or pepto bismal. Once I had an ulcer and my dr recommended that for my stomach. I ca n't believe how quickly it took away my nightly leg cramps and so far they have n't returned! :)######It 's possible that Mylanta has calcium in it. If the leg cramps are caused by a calcium deficiency then mylanta, tums, or any other over the counter calcium supplement would help. Moderate exercise is usually good as it helps circulation. I 'd ask what shoes you 're wearing and if there 's a connection between certain shoes (with heels, or just a lack of support) and the leg cramps. Shoes wear out, and even shoes that were supportive last year can loose their support and lead to cramping in the legs. Stretching your calves before bed is another good idea.

I am not as physically fit as I used to be but I still swim and play basketball weekly. My diet consist of fatty foods and I hardly drink beer but when I do it 's binge drinking, around 5-6 beers about once or twice a month. I went to ER complaining of stools without any pain at all, so they ran stool test, blood work and ct scan and everything was fine but my lipase levels were EXTREMELY elevated at 1700. They admitted me to hospital for a few days and I responded well to clear liguid diet the first day, I was retested and my lipase next morning was at 1050, still high but a significant reduction. Next morning it jumped to 1130. I was shocked and was upset that the lipase was not going down. All my lipids, liver panels and cbc were normal. GI doc said he 's certain it was acute pancreatitis. He then ordered a 2nd CT scan this time with oral and IV contrast and once again, it was clear but GI doc not did talk to me about results, he sent nurse in to send me home. They sent me home only telling me to lay off alcholol and see him in 2 weeks. Why would any responsabile doctor, especially GI send someone home with a dangerous lipase of 1130? I was shocked again. This still left me with many unanswered questons. Maybe you guys can help me out. 1. I get abdominal pain and sometimes mild diarrhea after drinking moster energy drinks, dairy and iced coffee drinks. Pain always lasted for a less than 5 mins and relieved after bowel movement, I never had pain that persisted for hours. I also associated this brief pain with IBS. No D if I stay away from those trigger foods. Does pancreatitis always create severe abominable pain lasting for more several hours? 2. How can a doctor tell if it 's acute or chronic pancreatitis? Can you have multiple acute attacks or is more than one attack considered chronic? From what I read CP eventually becomes less painful due to failing pancreas and amalyse levels are normal. Since I have no pain, I assume it 's CP and those small bouts of 5 minute pains were pancreatitis flare ups. 3. Anyone have insight of survival rate and lifespan with this condition if treated properly with low fat diet, exercise and abstinence from alcohol? I read it reduces lifepspan 10-20 years for any cp patient. 4. Does chronic marijuana use contribute to pancreatitis? I smoke tons of marijuana and I just switched to edibles after diagnosis, even though GI doc think it has nothing to do with it. Thanks.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

Streaked red mucus what can I do?######Sunflower6261979, A persistent cough should be evaluated by a physician. Pain medications will not reduce a couch. You could try some of the over the counter cough preparations. There are two types, depending upon the cough. A dry cough is usually treated with a cough suppressant. But, a wet cough is treated with an expectorant, which can actually make the patient cough more, but make it easier to cough up the phlegm. Again, pain medications (acetaminophen or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) will not reduce a cough. It is not uncommon to see small flecks or small streaks of blood after a persistent cough. This is due to the irritation and breaking of tiny blood vessels in the upper respiratory tract. However, coughing up significant amounts of blood (tablespoons to cups) is very concerning (called hemoptysis). That can be a sign of different lung infections or even a tumor. Thus, if the over the counter cough medications (also sucking an some sugar free candy will often lessen a cough) does not make the cough better, then you should see your physician. Good luck..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Cold, Flu and Viral Infections

Moreover, only very specific mutations in this gene are known to be associated with hereditary pancreatitis. In patient who have inherited these specific PRSS1 gene mutations, about 80% percent of them will go on to develop chronic pancreatitis. Most patients with hereditary pancreatitis will develop symptoms of pancreatitis by age 20 (though in some patients, the diagnosis may come later in life). Other than avoiding alcohol and tobacco, there is no known way to prevent or cure hereditary pancreatitis. Certainly, your son should be closely followed by a Gastroenterologist with expertise in managing chronic pancreatitis, should your he go on to develop this problem. (If he has one of the PRSS1 gene mutations associated with this disease, then I hope that he will be one of the 20% of affected patients who do not go on to develop pancreatitis.)

Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

I had attacks every second week with a four day stay in hospital to treat the pain, vomiting and rehydrate. In '08 I had temporary stents put in, they stay in for about a week and the they pass through (bowel). It stretches the alternate duct that the pancreas secretes from, letting the enzymes flow out. My duct was 2mm instead of about 7mm. After that procedure, which I 've got to get done every couple of years (2 so far) I have less pancreatic pain and far less attacks. Having said that, over the years I also have developed erosive gastritis, narcotic bowel syndrome and inability to eat much. And these problems together cause just as much hell! Also nocturnal epileptic seizures from a long term anti nausea med. Meds have caused these other issues to develop after long term use as Drs can only treat the symptoms.

My doctor prescribed omeprazole 40mg generic capsules that is covered by my insurance. It is made by Mylan and is delayed release. He wanted me to try it as a last resort before he calls my insurance company to fight for coverage of Nexium. Unfortunately, this omeprazole is not working well. I did n't notice anything until today (3rd day) and now I 'm having significant heartburn and reflux. I had tried 40mg Prilosec tablets (took 2 pills) before the doctor prescribed this omeprazole and I 'll have to say I think it worked better. I called the pharmacy to inquire and they said the omeprazole has no salts which apparently helps absorption in some? I 'm still not sure about this. If this is the case, why have two kinds? So I 'm thinking to switch to Prilosec tomorrow as I 'm becoming more and more miserable by the minute! Has anyone had different experiences between the two? Is omeprazole magnesium the formula closest to Nexium? Thanks for any help! This whole thing with no insurance coverage for Nexium has really been a bummer for me. Just shows how dependent I am on this medication. Thanks so much. Lori######I do n't know much about the comparison, but I do think you need to give the omeprazole more time. It took me 1-3 weeks to feel better and feel the effects of the medication. Once I quit cold turkey (horrible idea) and it took me 2 weeks back on the medication to feel the heartburn being suppressed. Then the omeprazole started to not work as well (I was on 1 20mg dosage per day), so my doctor told me to increase to 2 20mg pills per day. It took about a 1 and a half for me to feel the effects of that. So, give the omeprazole time.######If the OTC version of Prilosec works, then take that. Everyone's body processes things a little bit differently. That 's why it 's sometimes good to have slightly different medicines to treat the same thing. And, yes, the dependency thing is awful! Do n't you wish they 'd warned us?######I have taken what seems likes every PPI ever make like a merry go round use for able like a few years there it seem to lose some of it potencie anyways I have not found anything that works quite as well as Nexium I do not currently use because of the same issue of no insurance coverage. But you can buy omeprazole with magnesium over the conter in tablet and capsule form I currently use prescription omeprazole once day with prescription Radadine at night as needed. My GI doc says not everyone's body is diff so you have to see what works for you you might also ask about Dexilant which is the latest PPI's it was given to me by my regular doctor as a sample but I have not had a need to take it thank god! This stuff is supposed to be great but as like with anything it may or may not be covered by your insurance. GERD LUCK! Haha right this is what my GI do like to say geezs######Thank you everyone. I 've taken the prescription omeprazole from last Sunday to Tuesday. I then switched from that to Prilosec OTC. I thought it was working better but today I 've had my worst day. I 'm on day 5 now of no Nexium and I 'm concerned that this will get really bad in about 2 days. I know for a fact that Prevacid, Protonix, Dexilant do not work for me. Aciphex works very well but my tinnitus increases so loud that I struggle to sleep. I wish I could take it because my insurance covers it. I do not know if this Prilosec is going to work at all but I 'm praying with all my might that it just needs to build up. I do n't know whether to count the generic and the otc formula to say it is in my system now 5 days? I do n't understand why most of these drugs do not work well for me! The docs do not tell you about the dependence and I wish they did. I tried taking lower doses of PPI's in the past and none of them worked for my reflux/heartburn. I have a small hiatal hernia that should not cause me too much grief but it does! My doctor is not ready to call my insurance company and fight for Nexium coverage. I never thought I 'd be in this poistion where I feel like a drug addict!######I got here by typing ``omeprazole is killing me '' into my browser. I was taking Nexium but I recently changed insurance companies through work and they claim that Nexium is not a preventative medication so it is not covered. I took one Nexium a day and it was all I needed to halt my acid reflux, and I had no side effects that I was aware of. I have pretty much tried everything and nothing else works like Nexium. Sorry if this sounds like a commercial, but I do n't care. I got some samples but recently ran out and began taking Omeprazole. It is tearing me up. I have chronic pain and churning. I really do n't know what to do at this point. I could buy nexium for$ 200 a month, but that 's really not affordable. There are some who claim that Nexium is no different that Prilosec, but they do n't know what they are talking about. I would like to challenge the Insurance Company's claim that Nexium is indeed preventative. Does anyone have experience with that?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

It is sometimes doubled to deal with acute bouts of acid erosion. 40mg pantoprazole is roughly equivalent to 20mg omeprazole. I was on 80 mg omeprazole for a few years (prior to a fundoplication operation). When I discussed this with a gastroenterologist friend and colleague, he said, in some cases 120mg have been prescribed (and shown to be safe)- which would be equivalnet to 240mg pantoprazole.

I have GERD and take 20mg of Omeprazole each day. Any of your ever experience any of these sort of symptoms? It 's kind of coming down to GI vs. Muscular-Skeletal. ------- I am a 25 year old male that has been having mid and lower back pains along with some abdominal pains. I also have sore sides around the ribcage. Somtimes the pain comes across both bottom ribs, other times it can be felt in the chest. I even have some muscle twitching around these areas at times (not often). There is n't any constant relentless pain and I can function somewhat normally throughout the day. It 's more confusing and aggravating than anything. My past few weeks have consisted of:- Multiple PCP Doctor visits- ER twice (due to anxiety about abdominal pains)- Chiropractor twice- Massage Therapist It started out with me going into a walk-in clinic on the weekend because I had some lower left abdominal discomfort and a general unwell feeling, almost like I had the after effects of being kicked in the left man part (last time that happened, I had to get my appendix out!) . The doctor there did n't do any physical examination and decided to do a quick urinalysis. He said there were white blood cells and that I probably had a UTI, even though it 's rare for males. He gave me a heavy antibiotic (Bactrim) for three days. That drug put be on my back, destroyed my appetite and gave me nausea. I did n't eat much for 4 days and lost between 8-10 lbs. Not knowing if these were side effects, I went to the ER and followed up with my PCP. The ER did bloodwork, abdominal CAT scan, and a kidney and bladder ultrasound which came back normal. My PCP and ER did a urinalysis two different times, which came back normal, and told me that the dipstick method they used to test the urine in the walk-in clinic was probably not accurate and they really are not reliable. My PCP and ER did physical exams, checked my lymph nodes and even a prostate exam (ugh). All came back normal. My massage therapist checked my lymph nodes as well and said they were fine. She said all the soreness on the sides of my body along the ribs are definitely muscular. She said my left middle back and onto the ribs felt congested and a bit inflamed and that I need a chiropractor that would address it. She also said I felt well hydrated and not very tight in my upper back, neck and chest. It 's been almost 4 weeks with this. I have ``generalized anxiety disorder '' and the first two weeks for some of the most stressful weeks of my life. I felt almost in and out of depression because the doctors have n't been able to locate anything in particular. I worried myself sick. After CAT scans and lab work, it relieved much of the emotional symptoms due to mental relief, but I continue having these pains. My chiropractor for two sessions treated my neck and upper back because of his ``belief '' that it is the primary place to start. Yes my neck was as stiff as a board, but the pain was n't coming from there. I have a desk job and know for a fact that my posture was atrocious these past two years. Needless to say, I 'm seeing a new chiropractor today. I also have a GI Doc appointment next week, just in case. I have n't had any changes in the bathroom but some people have told me to rule things like gallbladder and GI issues out. Neither do these symptoms seem to coincide with meals (before or after), as far as I can tell. If it was n't for the abdominal/rib pains here and there, I would n't be posting here. Any help/recommendations would be appreciated!######Hi Krozak, the symtoms you describe can all be caused by Omeprazole. It took me a year to work out that was the cause in my case, having gone round in circles with tests etc.. The drug can cause bone pains, especially of the ribs. I realized the cause when I was doubled the dose of Omeprazole to 40mg and all those symtpms suddenly increased. Then I halved the dose again and the symtoms subsided again. Now I am tapering off Omeprazole and the bone pains are reducing as I take less and less Omeprazole. It also caused a host of other symptoms including a general feeling of unwellness. Of course, there can be other reasons for back pain. How long have you been on the med?######Kacyc, I 've been on Omeprazole for almost 8 months now. I did forget to mention that during the first week of all these things happening, I tried to quit omeprazole cold turkey for about 5 days (mostly because the first three days, I forgot to take it). My stomach burned and a horrible unwell feeling was present. It did n't help that I was finishing off a heavy antibiotic. I immediately jumped back on Omeprazole and the burning went away. Now these aches and pains have been going on. I never experienced these in the first 7 months of taking Omeprazole. I do n't think the antibiotics and cold turkey omeprazole quitting benefited my body.######What you experienced when you tried to quit was rebound hyperacidity. Not fun! The bone pains and general unwellness do not necessarily start straight away, it takes a while for the mineral deprivation to affect the bones!.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

I 've just begun serious research about reflux, with a goal of breaking my PPI dependence. I 've been taking omeprazole at 40mg/day for years, which suppresses my symptoms, but I 'm concerned about side effects. I can get by on 20mg/day, but only marginally (my GERD cough starts to come back). If I go 36 hours without a dose, I get the most wicked painful rebound heartburn and a migraine-like headache. My question concerns ACV and the low-acid theory of GERD. As I understand it, the LES is supposed to respond to low stomach pH by tightening up. People with too little stomach acid develop GERD because their LES does n't get the cue to close. ACV theoretically works by reducing stomach pH, thereby encouraging the LES to close up. If all of the above is correct, then why does rebound acidity from stopping PPIs not create the same effect? Can someone help me resolve this apparent contradiction? Thanks!######1) Apple cider vinegar is a weak acid. It does n't damage the throat or esophagus. Stomach acid, even diluted, is very strong and caustic. So any improvement in LES function from acid rebound is canceled out by the fact that the remaining reflux is so incredibly painful. (My one experience with truly uncontrolled rebound was 8 hours of pain so bad I could n't stand up straight. Nothing touched the pain. When I tapered, I managed to quit without major pain.) 2) Some people believe that it is n't the acid in ACV that relieves reflux symptoms, it 's another substance in the vinegar.######Thanks, janewhite1!

If the disease is placed into remission, then the symptoms of anemia will improve. Anemia of chronic disease will usually reflect whether a disease is getting worse or better. So the bottom line is that if treated properly, anemia symptoms will get better and will not cause problems..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

As my iron levels have improved, so has my panic symptoms.######I had never experienced a panic attack in my life until anemia. I would say yes, if you are an anxious person then the result would be anxiety and if you suffer depression then it is magnified with anemia. It is on the symptom list. FLFLOWERGIRL######Guess I was wrong, I thought I was anxious because I was stressing about being anemic. Not because the anemia was actually causing the anxiety.######The key is: did you feel anxiety and stress prior to your diagnosis? Before I knew I had anemia, I knew something was ``off ''. I was getting panicky feelings all the time-- in the mall, at work, while driving, etc. and I did n't have a clue why. Certainly, when I found out I had anemia I got really whizzed out about it and that made things worse. So, knowing you have it and worrying about it will cause anxiety but, in some people, the anemia itself can cause a type of panic disorder.######I was treated for anxiety and depression for years before anybody decided to check for anemia. when my anemia/iron levels get low, my anxiety is 100xs worse, when my levels are within the norm, the anxiety lessens. I was just relieved to find that there was a cause for it.######yes, i agree i thougt that i had anxiety attacks from being in a wreck.but before that my hands will shake for no reason at all. and i wasn ``t nervous or anthing.so it does come from being anemic..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

All of which is corrected with iron IF this is due to a straight forward simple (IDA) iron deficiency anemia. FLFLOWERGIRL######thank you for your reply. I was wondering.######Flowergirl is right- iron will only help if you are iron deficient. It is possible to be anemia and not iron deficient- I am chronically anemic, but I was only diagnosed when I went to see the doctor because the iron tablets were upsetting my stomach. You need to check if your ferritin levels are low as well as your haemoglobin, and if they are then you will need to take iron. If it turns out you have chronic anemia, and not iron deficiency anemia, then make sure you find out what 's causing it- it is usually a symptom of another, more serious disease.######lynn82nj-- Were you first DX `ed with IDA to find out that it was not? How did they discover that it was not IDA? Curious. FLFLOWERGIRL######I 'm still a bit unsure in my case- it seem I had iron deficiency, and then at some point a few months later anemia, but unrelated? to the iron deficiency. The anemia was from a stomach inflammation from H. Pylori. What I do n't completely understand is that my ferritin plummeted from 66 to 10 in just a few weeks after the inflammation was cured- and I had to take iron tablets immediately after, although just a few weeks before there was no iron deficiency, and iron tablets had caused black stools. (!!) I do n't know if that helps your question flowergirl! I also would like to know what 10 on the ``anemia scale '' means too (I was 9 the month before)- does everyone else get dizzy after lifting groceries/problem solving/just going about their day, or wake up in the morning feeling like they 've just been exercising and ca n't get their breath? I 'm feeling worse than I was at 9 and I 'm wondering if I do n't have something else, or if I 'm just poorly adapted to the anemia? I read about a girl who was still working a customer service job at 8.5, but has anyone been able to continue with academic work on anemia? I 've had to quit my work because I was delivering such poor results. Would be great to know your experiences. .######lynn82nj-- Thanks for your post. I was curious about the type of chronic anemia that you had. I too would have chronic anemia if it were n't for my doc saying that I am married to iron supplements. Your ferritin dropped because you used up all your iron, as it was trying to keep up with the lowered Hgb levels which caused your anemia. There is an automatic mechanism that knows when to kick in whenever there is blood loss, and calls on the ferritin stores possibly depleting them depending on the demand. If I understood your story correctly. Iron and blood loss both are a cause of black stools, some irons turns stool green. That would scare me after an internal bleed taking iron and the stool becoming black. To answer your question, a 10 Hgb is borderline moderate to mild anemia and 9 is moderately anemia. I understand what you are saying about feeling worse. This happened to me when I was 8.5 in the beginning I did n't even know it and felt almost completely fine (like the girl in your story) until one day I almost blacked out once. I was working really hard physically. Then, as time went on and my blood levels were building I felt much worse. The only thing that I can think of that would cause this, is the fact that ~ for me ~ it went on for along time. My blood cells were severely small at 65 MVCV and not carrying enough oxygen needed for the heart to function properly. I had palps, tachycardia, high BP, and all sorts of fun things happen as a result. I think that because your anemia came on rather quickly that your body did n't have time to adjust, as mine went on for years probably. Your tolerance of anemia is proportional to the rate that it has developed. This is probably why your symptoms are more profound than someone with a slowly developing anemia like myself. I had to quit working, some people do. Everyone handles anemia differently; it really depends on what else your body has to deal with, as in any other underlying conditions. In a few months you will mostly likely recover from your anemia and then you will know if this is the cause of your problems. In the beginning it only took me 2 months to become non anemic. Good luck to you. Keep us posted. FLFLOWERGIRL######Thanks for your post Flowergirl- yes, I think you 've understood me correctly. That could definitely explain why I 'm feeling worse now than at any other point. What do you mean, you were non-anemic in 2 months ``in the beginning ''? How did it recurr, or why? Was it the same kind of anemia in both cases? Are you completely cured now? It sounds like your blood cells were really, really small. .######lynn82nj-- I was unable to tolerate iron and ended up with enteritis for 3 months (inflamed sm intestine and nausea), that was from taking ferris sulfate. I had to discontinue iron until healed and then resume low dose iron that was not enough and my blood dropped from 12.9 to 10.8 low with a 6 ferritin, until I had a procedure to stop blood loss. It was the same problem, instead of Iron Deficiency Anemia, it became Iron Resistant Deficiency Anemia. The anemia is resolved but I am trying to get the ferritin past 41. They say that I am having malabsorption due to long term use of PPI's for GERD. I have other symptoms probably unrelated to ferritin and anemia that came up during this period. FLFLOWERGIRL######it sounds like it must have been really frustrating- good luck and I hope that once your ferritin is ok again that that will be the end of your problems. I just got word back that my haemoglobin is now up to 11.6, just within normal range, just 4 weeks after the h. pylori being cured, and my iron and ferritin are slowly creeping up as well. so hopefully nothing more to worry about there you are right though, getting better is the hardest part- I 'm sure I was n't this weak before now! weird how the body adjusts to cope######I 'm glad that your numbers came up so quickly. Now that you are rid of the bacteria you should be fine. My mom had that happen 2 years ago with anemia and she has never had another problem with it. Best of luck to you too!

What does it mean?.######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia######Hey everyone, I was diagnosed as a anemic about 6 months ago. My primary doc said it was due to heavy periods (not sure how she knew since she never asked but thats besides the point). Prior to being diagnosed, I was having pain in my thighs and legs. After I was put on iron supplements, the pain in my legs went away. Recently the pain in my legs has creeped back up. I also had a full blood work up due to other issues and my RDW count was high, 16.3. No one called to tell me, I had to find out from the report I requested myself. Im guessing this is not cause for concern since I was n't notified. After researching online, it looks like the high RDW is from the anemia. Anyone else have this? Should I call my doctor and see if I should start taking more iron supplements? Just not sure if its an issue since they did n't call. Do n't wan na make a big deal if there is n't one. Thanks!######If you have a high RDW and have been diagnosed with anemia I am sure it 's due to the anemia. With only seeing the RDW value I can ' say for sure but I 'm guessing so. Having a high RDW combined with other things is most likely how the Dr. determined it was anemia. Red blood cells are normally all about the same size. When you have anemia they become larger and vary in size etc.. High RDW can indicate an anemia problem, a B12 problem, or even both so it 's important that you get a handle on this. Your body is telling you something. Call. Anemia is nothing to mess around with. You do n't want to sit around and wait for it to get worse this is something your going to have to grab the bull by the horns with and get taken care of. You ca n't just take iron till you feel better and stop. Anemia is just a symptom of a larger issue that needs fixed or you will continue to struggle. Be it Celiac's or bleeding it needs investigated. Once you get the cause taken care of your body will start trying to fix itself depending on how bad off you are taking supplements might be in order or just switching up your diet a bit and taking in more irony rich foods. Call your Dr.######The RDW being high just means your red blood cell size is less uniform than usual. The important point is, has your hemoglobin and hematocrit improved from 6 months ago with the iron supplements? If you do n't have heavy periods to explain the anemia, or if your blood count has not improved with 6 months on iron, you need a full workup to determine the cause and to verify if the anemia is from iron deficiency or something else, like folate or B12 deficiency. A hematologist may be needed..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

Told to just come back in a month for another blood test. I am 49 and in good health otherwise. Tonight when I got thome I see both ankles are swollen as if there is fluid around them. Could this be from anemia or maybe something else. I have also had leg cramps at night the last few nights. I am scared something is really wrong. Thoughts?######nycjane-- It is not enough to be anemic and begin iron without investigating the reasons why. It is most commonly blood loss with iron deficiency anemia. Anemia is a symptom of another process going on in the body. I had to see the GYN for ultrasound and have an ablation procedure then off to the GI doc for and endo/colonoscopy. These test are standard to rule out the things that may cause the anemia. Leg cramps are a symptom of anemia. I 'm not sure about the swelling of ankles makes me think of a circulation issue. Everyone experiences different things and different symptoms are indicitive of different types of anemia. It very well may be from your anemia. Usually if you already have an underlying health condition it becomes worse with anemia. I would watch your salt intake, elevate your feet above your heart and ice if necessary and see how you do. If it persists I would bring this up to your doc and see what they say about it. I would n't get up set at this point, after what I have learned. In the beginning I was really ill and scared. You are not at a life threatening point. FLFLOWERGIRL######You are right flowergirl. I am waiting for more blood test results which he says wil tell him why I am anemic. It 's puzzling to me as I take a vitamin supplement and have for years. This is new since last summer. As to the ankle swelling- MD attributes it to Aleve which I have been taking for an inflamed hand (not sure what thast all about). I cut out the Aleva and voila- much better. Unfortunately my finger is worse LOL. I left him a message this morning. I want to get to the bottom of things.######nycjane-- Are you still having periods, if so, are they heavy? It can also be related to the GI tract as well. It 's good that the swelling problem is gone. I `ts good that you are following up on the mild anemia because it is a symptom of something going on. There is a lot of information on this board too. Keep us posted on your results. FLFLOWERGIRL######Just starting perimenopause, flflowergirl, so no connect there. Periods are starting to scatter. I have been reading the board and learning a lot. Did n't hear back from the MD so results must not be in yet, as he is good about returning calls. I am anxious as I 've alays been in very good health and as a matter of fact the anemia showed up on a blood test which he was doing for my joint swelling. I 've been feeling well up till then.

Associated with Anemia?.######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia######Just curious, I am 33, always had great BP readings, until I found out I had anemia. During the Anemia process my BP was high, I was on iron supplements, my OBGYN never really said anything other than, that is high for you. I was having the rapid heart race etc., all associated with the anemia. My body was not absorbing the oral iron, so they referred me to a hematologist. My BP was high during my 2 visits to the hematologist, he commented on it, but that was it and I had iron IV in March. My follow up appt 4 wks later to the hematologist my BP was still high and he put me on meds. I have felt bad the whole 30 days I have been on them, tired and dizzy, sick stomach. Well now my BP is too low and they want to see me. Could the anemia have caused a spike in my BP? maybe I never should have been put on meds? Anyone else have this experience?######When I was at my lowest iron and ferritin levels, I had tachycardia and awful, inexplicable anxiety. If you have anxiety, it could be causing your BP to spike. Once the iron began to raise my levels (and with other holistic help), my anxiety disappeared. You will find alot of people here have had to deal with anxiety caused by anemia along with a bunch of other symptoms. I do n't know if BP will raise as a function of anemia. Those are just my thoughts. Let's see what others say.######hannah-- I did exactly what you are saying. Same thing. I tried meds to for 30 days and had to stop because my BP also went too low. Now I am better and the problem has resolved. If I have anxiety it will go up but nothing like what was happening to me back then, it was very scary. Good luck to you. FLFLOWERGIRL######Thank you, I think it is anxiety as well. I dont think I have chronic HBP. I did have increased anxiety levels during the anemia that does not seem to have diminished even after the iron treatment. I am going to request an anxiety medication rather than BP medicine.######It also takes time even after the anemia for the blood cells to go back to normal size. It took me months because mine were severely small, MCV was 65. This means lack of oxygen (as you already know), and that I think makes the BP much worse. Even if I might have a small increase in BP, It is not bad. Before I thought that I was going to have a heart attack or something then the anxiety set it. They also scared me by putting me on meds, they said it might only be temp. but they too hurt my stomach and I could n't do it. Keep us posted. FLFLOWERGIRL######I actually get hypotensive when my anemia gets bad. I am normally on BP medication but I have had to stop it while on this course of IV iron. I was having dizzy spells, almost to the point of passing out. My BP's were only 90/54 whenever I would check them. I found many medical sites that indicated that anemia could cause a low blood pressure. I always have the fast heart rate too..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

(i have heavy periods.) I 've had weakness and tingling in mostly my legs and sometimes my arms for a long time and I thought it was becaue of my ancient mattress and my sleeping habits. I just read today that it is a symptom of anemia. And a year ago, I was diagnosed with RBBB, a blockage in my heart, and I find out through research that it may have been cause by anemiad, which is all news to me. Now, I had this bruise on my leg that 's been here for a long, long time and it wo n't heal. i do n't know where it came from. I showed it to a doctor, and he did n't look too concerned about it. Could this bruise have something to do with the anemia and that 's why it wo n't go away?######If your doctor is not concerned about the bruise, the likely cause may be that it is located in a spot that is easily bumped. The one thing about anemia that some people have is the reduced ability to notice a bump or scratch. It does not mean you can not feel pain, it is just reduced so that you may not pay much attention to a place that gets bumped repeatedly, like a desk, or piece of furniture, or car door etc..######Bruising easly is one of the signs of anemia. I am anemia from my RA and when I have my period I can feel that my anemia has gotten worse. I am alot more cold and tired. My doctor said that there is nothing I can do about the anemia. The anemia will get better when my rheumatoid arthritis gets better. So far that has not happened. I am tired all the time and trying to work a full time job. My sister is also on Slow Fe but she only takes one a day. So I guess her iron is not that low.######Bruising can definitely be a sign if anemia. I have RA and I 'm very anemic. Despite taking the iron I 'm still anemic and they do n't know why. I 've had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy which showed no active bleeding. I am perimenopausal and sometimes get very heavy periods/ I think that this is what 's doing it but my doctor disagrees because I do n't have the heavy periods every month. What else could it be? I eat right and exercise, take my iron, etc. and I still come up anemic. Now they 're thinking it may be an absorption issue. I have an appt. later this month with my rheumatologist. I guess I 'll have to wait and see!.######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

My doctor insists that there 's no way my symptoms can be caused by anemia because it 's too mild. (The hematocrit is the worst, at 32.) Yet all my symptoms fit the list of anemia symptoms exactly. What 's the borderline when people have symptoms? Is it possible to be more sensitive than most people and be symptomatic even if the numbers do n't drop dramatically? Thanks.######Hi. You are certainly NOT being a ``pest '' by venting your concerns. That 's what we all do here !!!!!!!! I just wanted to comment on your question as to whether some people are more ``sensitive '' to anemia than others. I 'm guessing you are wondering if some people feel the ``effects '' more severely (or less) than others. I will tell you my experience and you can go from there. I was diagnosed with ``bleeding angiodysplasias '' in 2002 after suffering from anemia for over 2 years. I have a mixed connective tissue disease so I thought the anemia was stemming from that. But when my levels got very low (hematocrit- 21; hemoglobin- 5.2) I finally realized something else had to be going on. My gastroenterologist diagnosed the problem and has since sent me for 2 blood transfusions (bleeding angiodysplasias have an 80 percent chance of re-bleed but are never `life-threatening '). My doctor expressed ``amazement '' that I was even able to get out of bed with my blood levels being that low. But other than shortness of breath and mild heart palpitations and fatigue, the severe anemia was not all that debilitating. Of course I have all my aches and pains due to autoimmune condition, so maybe I had just ``toughened up '' over the years !! Who knows? I was just making the point (for what it 's worth) that anemia like any condition affects everyone differently. I wish you luck !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!######My hematocrit at the beginning of this year was 30, and I was suffering extremely from anemia. Extreme fatigue, achy, hair loss, etc.. After 300 mg of iron a day I just got retested and am up to 35 and feel a ton better. Some days are better than others. I think each person reacts differently. I hope you get feeling better. My anemia is due to the fact that I have a bleeding disorder called VonWillebrand's..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

Anyway, this was my second bout of pancreatitis-- my first one was in 1998 and led to me having my gallbladder removed a few months later. I do n't drink. I do n't have a gallbladder. People do n't know why I had this bout of pancreatitis, so I got sent to a GI specialist who suggested I have an MRCP (an MRI version of an ERCP). This turned out completely normal. Meanwhile, my serum lipase is elevated (700 instead of being < 250 or so) and so I am on lipram/pancreas for the next few months. At the same time as all this, I went to another doc for another reason and she thougth my thyroid was enlarged. So this led to more tests, one of which triggered the thought that maybe all this is linked to an auto-immune disease. Does anyone have any experience like this? Any words of advice? Thanks. lemonhead######Hi Lemon, I am sorry about your problems but I have only known one person in my life to have preaceatitis. Has a Doctor determined why yours is putting out so much lipase?

I hope your doctors can find the problem and get it taken care of for you.######What were your major symptoms with Pancreatitis besides the pain? Where was your pain? The doctor thinks I could possibly have pancreatitis as well, I dont drink, smoke either and I supposedly dont have gallbladder problems so it is a real puzzler to me and her but who knows. Was just wondering to get a better idea of the symptoms. Gl trying to find out what is up.######My pancreatitis was mostly manfested in mid-epigastric pain (like just below my sternum) which could only be slightly relieved by doubling over and slouching. Have you had your serium lipase and amylase levels checked? Those are usually important in determining a Dx of pancreatitis. . hope this helps. lemon######My lipase level was normal but the amylase was elevate to 123, normal range is 21-101. I heard that ppl with pancreatitis usually have higher leveles of amylase than that but who knows. I have yet to get the urinalysis test results back which was also testing for amylase. How high was yurs? well i havta get to class, ttyl! ~ Shanny######When I was having my acute pancreatitis attack last Dec (which put me in hosp for 6 days), my lipase was 38,000 and my amylase was 1400. Now my lipase is still elevated but my amylase is back to normal. I have had loads of tests though since I last posted and they found I have a tumor in my pancreas and a growth in my duodenum. I expect I 'll have to have those out at some point. Could explain my elevated lipase though. Good luck on your quest for an answer. lemon######Wow, lemon i will be praying for you health! That is so not cool but God is a divine healer, no? Good luck to you and thanks for your help.

Had bloodwork that showed my lipase was elevated slightly, then after repeating almost 2 months later, found that it was 80 points higher at 386. This is n't extremely elevated I 'm told, but why is it continuing to elevate? I had an abdominal ultrasound and a mrcp, but both were normal. When all of my symptoms started i noticed that sugar and caffiene both seemed to make me feel very anxious all of a sudden, and they make my heart rate increase. I still can not eat many sweets and do n't do any caffiene, because the symptoms are still there. What could cause the lipase to elevate and could the problem I 'm having with sugar and caffiene be related?######Did you ever get an answer?

I would love to find out how this all turned out for you.######Hi everyone who is having the same problem with slightly elevated lipase levels! I too am having the same issues. I am a nurse at a Duke facility and have talked with many MD's r/t this. I am very bad reflux disease and in fact, my last EGD showed i having Barrett's esophagus. (just metaplasia, no dysplasia) However, i am planning on having the surgery to repair hiatal hernia and prevent reflux. (Nissen fundaplication) ANYWAY... had some bloodwork done that showed elevated lipase. (@ 80 points than norm i think) I never had any elevated amylase levels which usually peak prior to lipase in gallbladder attacks. This really freaked me out b/c i knew lipase was so closely r/t pancreas disorders. I do n't drink alcohol (maybe 1 time every couple months) on regular basis and i was not really having any pain as in gallbladder attack, but reflux does cause alot of bloating and miserable full feeling after eating. Never any nausea/vomiting. My GI doc ordered a MRCP which came back normal. I have continued to have my blood redrawn which still shows elevated lipase levels. I am told that this can definitely be r/t GI problems and they are finding much more of this in people with reflux disease. It still freaks me out b/c i just took care of a patient yesterday that got checked out b/c her brother died of pancreatic cancer at 55. She found out she has mass on pancreas and her MRI (not MRCP) ws negative and did not show this small mass.She was having some GI symptoms such as n/v b/c the mass was beginning to obstruct the duct from the pancreas. Just continue to follow up and keep close watch on everything.it is a rather unnerving feeling to have this! The surgeon will more than likely remove my GB when we do other surgery. . he will be able to take a closer look than US especially since GB appears normal. OH well Take Care everyone!######Elevation in Lipase is at times associated with pancreatitis or gallstones. The pancrease is a gland that secreates insulin in response to glucose circulation in the blood. Sugar and Caffiene stimulate the pancrease to secreate insuin but I dont think this is a cause for pancreatitis. Alcohol consumption can cause it. How are your liver enzymes? The fact that Protonix helped the symptoms leads to a gastroesophageal reflux being the problem.######jpo4, my symptoms are very similar. did you ever find a solution?######jp04 here and no, still nothing. Since I last posted my husband had an internal ultrasound which I was very excited about because they would actually be looking at the pancrease... and, nothing, totally normal pancreas. He still suffers and continues to take Ultrase to manage his pain and it does help. He is on a new med. as of today that is supposed to help w/ a syndrome referred to as C.R.A.P. (Chronic Recurring Abdominal Pain). Basically, when you cont. to have problems like this but they can not diagnose you- you have CRAP. The new med. is a treatment for a spastic colon. The dr. thinks this might help with the pain and heavyness he feels after eating. I will keep you posted on how that goes. They also took bloodwork again so I 'll post those results as well. Thanks.######FYI I started out with abdominal pain that could not be explained and pretty much ignored by doctors until i ended up in the hopsital with acute pacreatitis and was in the hospital for 3 months and almosted died because of how bad it was and now have chronic pancreatitis and liver chirrosis caused by the pancreatitis so please please continue to persist with your inquiries to doctors so that you do n't end up the way I did. I am permanetly scarred and damaged for the rest of my life because i believed the doctors when they said there was nothing to worry about.######Jpo4 what medication did they put your husband on and have you looked into gastroparesis? My daughter has gastroparesis and has CRAP all the time along with an occational elevated lipase level. Can anyone tell me what is a normal level and what is a dangerous level?######Well I do n't know exactly what is considered dangerous or not but I have had pancreatitis a couple times. My lipase the first time was over 2500 and I was admitted to the hospital. The second time it was over 7000, they just gave me pain killers and sent me home. That makes me think a certain level is not considered dangerous, it is when it is combined with other symptoms that can be dangerous, like shock.######my mother went for regular blood test. Has acid reflux and was put on 40mg of omeprazole. She 's also on lipitor, 20 mg. Takes a lot of herbs but not at same time as meds. (Life Extension) She took 2 glutamine tabs that morning (forgot to take nothing). Tests came back with amylase 156 and lipase 66. Liver normal. Doc said nothing to worry about, would retake blood test. Mom has no stomach pains or pancreatitus symptoms, does not drink, has no gallbladder, liver is fine! Pelvic sonogram took a month ago was fine! She is 85 years old. So why does the doc want her to take a catscan? any1 know? My siblings say doc might be good but trying ' to milk the insurance company for all he can get. What do you think?######Catscan will confirm any deformities or abnormalities in the pancreas (and other organs) that may not be apparent by bloodwork. Elevated amylase may suggest pancreatitus, although the lipase level looks great, lipase may take longer to parallel the amylase level. That said, the CT scan will allow the doc to determine if this is chronic pancreatitis, for example. I had to BEG my doctor for a CT scan, so I would take the doc's advice in this instance. Many doctors are hesitant to do a CT because there is a level of radiation exposure during the procedure.######SHILOHDREAM Hello, I had my CT Scan today only because a CT Scan can show more on the pancreas than what an ultrasound can show. Well that is the reason that I had to go for one, as I am in so much pain I can not eat. Am feeling like a pin cushion believe me. I am sure that it is all just to make sure with your mother is fine. All the best aussievic######I have had the exact same symptoms. ekg's and echo's because of the anxiousness and elevated b/p. Finally had and ultrasound that showed stones and sludge in gallbladder. Had the gall bladder removed 5 weeks ago and still having pain bloating elevated lipase and heartburn. Have since had ct, hida scan and mri with contrast. all showing nothing. I am so frustrated right now. surgeon says he thinks it was pancreatitus but no real dx of that.######Almost exact same thing is happening to me. I had all the tests and scans then finally said sludge and stones in gallbladder, but I was too sick and lipase was too high to remove, levels stayed high and took the risk and I had gallbladder removed, and am still sick with high lipase levels, ca n't eat, in pain, do n't know what to do...######Hi Im 26 years old and I have read all your emails just wondering if you could help me. I have had intermittent abdo pain on the right radiating to my back for about 3 weeks gradually getting worse. I have had a loss of appetite bur with no other real symptoms part from this pain. I was admitted to hospital with? Kidney stones I have had an USS which was normal, CT scan which also came back normal, I was discharged with advice that it was muscle pain. I was in extreme pain again so went back and they checked my amylase which was raised at 378 normal lipase and slightly deranged LFTs. Does any one have any ideas it 's going into the 4 th week now.######I have been having chest, back, arm, shoulder pain and went to the hospital and was told everything looked fine but my lipase level was elevated at 82... I also been having the same problems with caffine and at times I get really lightheaded... as of right now Dr's havent found anything... and they put me on ultram... I have been feeling like this for a good while now and its only getting worse######I have the same simptoms after Levaquin antibiotic, that is same like Cipro, Avalox ect.######See a gastroenterologist! My lipase levels were elevated at around 433 after incorrectly receiving antibiotics for what turned out to be a viral infection. Due to the elevated levels I was experiencing extreme pain in my upper left back where the pancrease resides. After about a month off of the antibiotics my levels are returning to normal but I still have gastritis because of the meds which will take 8-12 months to heal. My gastro dr told me lipase levels well over 1000 are actual pancreatitis and require hospitalization but tracked my lipase levels until they were in the normal range again. My gastristis (stomach lining inflamation) was diagnosed with a EGD (upper endoscopy) and I am now on dexilant 60mg once a day and a low fat diet without milk products until it is healed (cross fingers 8-12 weeks) In some of my research I found the following useful. Upper left back pain may be the pancreas. Upper right back pain is the gall bladder. The pancreas and the gallbladder share some of the same billary ducts and gallstones can cause blockage. It sounds like the common factor is elevated lipase for many of you but the underlying cause could be several things that may take a few visits to the same doctor and your own research to find an answer. Hope some of this helped. Good Luck!######Has anyone found out anything new ?? I have had gas, bloating, anxiety and abdominal pain for over a year now. Slightly elevated lipase, one doctor says I have pancreatitis and the next says I dont. Still no answers.######@ErinSYD84 I have had the same symptoms, with increasing severity, for several months. I am a very skinny healthy 30 y.o. female. No matter what I eat I bloat and look pregnant. I have attacks that last from 40 mins to several hours with extreme abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant that radiates into my right shoulder and back. I have a slightly elevated lipase level (90 with norms from 5.1- 51.3) and just had a normal ultrasound. What lead your doctor's to pancreatitis? I am trying to decide if further testing is going to be helpful or just continue to lead me down the ``I 'm not quite sure '' path my doctor is currently on.######I went to the doctor back in feb 2011, i had lower left abdominal. he asked whether i had consumed any alcohol. i had and he ran blood test and my lipase were slightly elevated sitting at 80. I have not consumed any alcohol since then and still have symptoms. Amalayse have never elevated. lipase have gone up and down over the year. Have had ultrasound and ct scan. both normal. i am booked in to see a professor of gastro problems in April hopefully finds something. Every gp i have been says to just stick to low fat diet. dosent help. also i find my digestive pain gets worse before my period..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Abdominal Pain

I had a Dx of LPR last January (2006), and have been taking Nexium + Prilosec OTC. I have a endoscopy scheduled for this Wednesday due to slight troubles with swallowing and constant mucus in the back of my throat that just won t go away. I have been having lower back problems for quite awhile (years), but recently have been experiencing mid-back pains. I have also recently been getting slight nausea off/on throughout the day. Nothing major whatsoever, but just that slight nauseating feeling in my belly. About 4 days ago, my stools have been getting lighter & lighter, almost to a tan color. Obviously this is of concern after reading about mid-back pains, light stool, nausea and losing weight being associated with pancreatic cancer. I may just be over-reacting here. My 1st logical thought is that my chances of getting pancreatic cancer at the age of only 50 is remote, especially having never smoked and almost never consume alcohol. 70% of those Dx d with pancreatic cancer are between 65-80 years old. However, I m guessing I should ask my doctor on Wednesday about these symptoms and see if I can get tested for pancreatic cancer, such as CBC bloodwork (including liver function, WBC, etc), stool test and CT scan. Are there other ailments associated with the pancreas that has these same symptoms? Does pancreatitis show these same symptoms? Thanks for any response.######Hi I have been having similar symptoms for 6 months. I am a 42 year old female. No nausea but I had chronic runs for 4 months have lost 10lbs and constant stomach and back pain. I have had all kinds of tests and worried about my pancreas. Everything has come back negative. I have had ultrasounds, full bloods, x rays, CT, small bowel series, etc.. If you find out anythng let me know. I was told it would show on the CT with contrast. I hope you get answers.######Hello I am experiencing some of the same symptoms. I have light stool and no appetite. I do not have jaundice and that is a positive sign, I hope. I am having a CT done this Friday in hopes of ruling out Pancreatic or Liver cancer. I am very uncomfortable with the possibility of either. Ish######There could be many causes for the symptoms you are experiencing! Although, I am 27 and female and have never smoked or drank at all. I now have chronic pancreatitis and I get many of the symptoms you spoke of. I came down with a severe case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis 3 years ago due to my triglycerides being way too high (over 2000). They diagnosed me by my amylase and lipase being elevated, but now that I have chronic pancreatitis my amylase and lipase no longer elevate during a ``flare-up '' so a normal blood test result for amylase and lipase are n't a definitive way to diagnose it. A CT scan will usually show it, but for me the defining test was an endoscopic ultrasound (that was how I got the chronic diagnosis). But the troubles malabsorption that comes with pancreatitis can cause the stools to become very light in color, increase, and can even be diarrhea.######Did yout CT show any abnormality with your pancreas? Thanks for the information.######I just had blood drawn today for the full CBC test. I 'm guessing if there 's a problem with the pancrease/ gall bladder/ liver = this should show something, right? what results should I be looking at particularly? Are these the ones that would show a problem in these areas......... > Bilirubin > AST/ ALT > Albumin > Lipid > Triglyceride > WBC > RBC If these come back OK, can I rule out pancrease problems? Thanks. Mark PS- I think I 'll discuss a CT scan with my GI Dr. tomorrow before my endoscopy.######the CT showed and still shows nothing, but we know for sure that I do have CP. To check for Acute pancreatitis they usually draw an amylase/lipase level. The triglyceride level is what was off for me and caused the whole thing. It was over 2000######Can I ask what are your symptoms? Do you have stomach pain and where and do you have it all the time or intermittantly? Thanks for your help.######I just got my bloodwork back, and here are the results for the ``pancreas related '' issues...... > Bilirubin = (0.2-1 .2) OK > AST = (10-35) OK > ALT = (9-60) OK > Albumin = (3.6-5 .1) OK > Cholesterol = (125-200) OK > Triglyceride = (< 150) OK > WBC = (3.8-10 .8) OK > RBC = (4.2-5 .80) LOW > Glucose = (65-99) HIGH Based on these, can I be fairly certain that the pancreas is not an issue here? I tried to explain to my DR that I have pain in my middle back, but she fluffed off ANY remote chance that it pancreas. Is elevated glucose any indication of pancreas problem, or is just because I 'm chubby? LOL! Thanks for any opinions..######-Cancers###-Cancer: Pancreatic & Liver

What exactly is the point of this test? Also, is it necessary to fast prior to having it done? An Urgent Care doctor ordered some blood work. I was n't exactly sure what he was ordering, but when I checked in for results today, the nurse mentioned something about lipase. I could n't get any additional information because another nurse stepped in. Nurse# 2 said that I 'd have to pay the co-pay of$ 15 to get the information. Oh brother. I asked if I could just have a copy of the results then. She said, ``sure... for$ 15 ''. Oh brother. I just ca n't bring myself to pay$ 15 for what I really feel I should be entitled to. Now I 'll have to ask my primary to have the results sent to him so that I can get a copy. How ridiculous. Anyway, I looked up `lipase test '. There 's not much, but what I did find indicated that one should fast for it...? I did not fast for the test, as I was n't advised to. I wonder if the results will even be accurate then...? Please help me with any information you may have regarding this test. Thanks a lot!######Lipase is used to help diagnosed pancreatitis or other pancrea disorders/problems. But it also helps with diagnosis of other problems. Its usualy paired up with amylase test. And yes you normally have to fast for it though your doctor may not have wanted a fasting one?

I began with a routine dr. visit that showed elevated AST and Lipase- he ordered an ultra sound, MRI and some other blood work. Everything else was normal and the plan was to keep watching the numbers every three months. Sincethat time both the AST and Lipase have increased (AST is 60- the range is 0-37), Lipase is at 44- range is 4-24 and this past test shows that the Amylase is 102- range is 0-88. The amylase is a new one and the dr wants to keep on watching. I am struggling with anxiety over this. It has been a year, my numbers are increasing and I still do n't have an answer as to why. Does anyone have any ideas or have been through the same thing that can offer some encouragement. I will be very honest, I am afraid I am going to die from this and I do n't want to die yet! I am 39 and have never drank really- once in a while at a wedding, that is it. I do n't have Hetatitis, he checked for all of those. Any suggestions? Thank-you! - Stacey######See another Dr. My husband was dx 'd with bile duct cancer and it took a couple weeks of seeing other Drs. before we found one who knew what was going on. Do n't wait! Tell your Dr. you want to see a liver specialist and have him make you an appointment. Do n't take no for an answer. If he wo n't do it get rid of him. Where do you live? If in Ca. I can give you some places to call for specialists. Good luck, Charlene######Hi Stacey-- For your peace of mind I 'd see a GI/liver specialist... your# 's can be elevated from many many things-- everything we eat drink and breathe is filtered thru our liver !! You 're# 's do need to be watched, but it sounds like they are elevated and not doubled or tripled. That 's a good sign. I know you 're scared and the first thing you think of is ``I 'm going to die ''... totally understandable. A few's-- do you have any digestive probelms, IBS, gallstones; are you diabetic? Any physical symptoms-- pains after eating, etc? Did they mention fatty liver? Now for the good part-- your liver has amazing regenerative powers-- you do n't drink much... that 's always a plus !! I am 40, 125... On a fluke, my liver failed. The planets all lined up that day. Lucky me. lol But-- my liver regenerated itself after total liver failure. I just wanted you to see a success story-- which are common w/the liver. Obviously in extreme cases, the liver ca n't bounce back. It 's not always cancer. A GI or Liver Specialist may run a few other blood tests, but they do this all day every day-and they can usually look at the tests and in talking w/you tell you what 's going on-- or where they have to go from there. They 'll probably look at your MRI's etc from the past yr or so-and maybe order their own-- do n't let that scare you. It 's standard. My GP totally missed my signs of a failing liver-- MANY outwardly physical signs he (and my husband and I) could see. The liver spec picked up on them immediatley-after it was already done. Thru this I did not have yellow skin-- only my eyes were jaundice the day this happened. So everyone is different-- every experience is different, and the waiting is the WORST part... too much time for too many thoughts going thru your head !! I know how you feel. It 's ok to be scared-but see a specialist. Then you can start sleeping at night !! Feel free to ask as many? 's as you need to-- it helps. Hang in there !! Hope you 're feeling better. Gina######I thought your amylase and lipase had to do with your pancreas.######It used to be thought that extremely high lipase levels were indicative of pancreatitis-- that is no longer the case. Diseases involving the pancreas produce levels of lipase 5-10 x higher than normal levels. So yes, it can be assoc w/pacreatitis, but depending on other symptoms (or lack there of) they can be indicative of other things. A lipase test determines the serum level of a specific enzyme involved in digestion (indicating common GI problems). Meds can also elevate your lipase/amylase levels too..######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

I saw the GI doc this week and he is CONVINCED it is indeed my gallbladder. He said that he thinks there may be stones embedded in the wall of the gallbladder that are n't showing up or that the pressure gets too high, even though the ejection fraction is OK. So, he wants me to force another ``attack '' and get some additional blood work done (the first round did n't include amylase and lipase) as he wants to be sure I do n't have pancreatitis. If things go as ``planned '' and we rule out the pancreatitis, looks like I will be next on the list for a gallbladder operation. He did mention something about pancreatic divisim, but that would be the guess if the amylase and lipase are elevated. So, back to square 1 in thinking my gallbladder is the problem. So, next on my list is to eat a few high fat meals to force this attack and then see where things go. Kinda weird to have doctor's orders for a high fat meal though. LOL. Jen######Jen, can you let me know what happens. I have all negative tests including pancreas enzyme levels. My Hida scan and ultrasound was normal too. I am in pain everyday for 8 months now. I have been told to go to the Mayo Clinic all my doctors do not want to see me as they ca n't do anything for me. (I have had two Gastro dr's) Can you tell me what your symptoms are?

Seeking educated advice.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders######I 'm grasping at straws on how to approach a health issue I 've been dealing with for the past 6-8 months or so. This board seems to be as good a forum as any but if there is somewhere online better suited to seek advice with these problems please feel free to direct me there. This post could have gone under a few different forums on this board alone, but when you 're talking amylase/lipase the pancreas is the main concern. I honestly do n't know if this is a pancreas problem though. This is going to be a lot to read, and I thank anyone in advance that takes the time to do so and share any feedback. I 'm a male in my early 30s generally in good health. I had a stretch of about 10 days earlier this year where my bowel movements increased from the normal once per day, to 3-5 times per day. I was very concerned and my doctor suspected IBS, but after some blood work she saw that my amylase was in the 500 level and sent me to get a CAT scan. She did not let me know that my lipase was normal though, and after reading online about elevated amylase I jumped to the conclusion I probably had pancreatitis. I do enjoy drinking alcohol on a regular basis and this period of irregular bowel movements did come around the time of a particularly bad weekend in terms of my alcohol consumption. I figured that a decade of drinking had probably done this to my pancreas. When I went to the hospital for the CAT scan the technician thought it was strange that my script just with the barium milkshake prep and not with an imaging injection. She almost tried to convince me to go ahead and get the imaging anyway to eliminate the need to come back and do the scan again with it. I thought this was outside of the area of expertise of the technician to decide and told her so. She went and consulted with the doctor who was going to review the scan and he confirmed that I just needed the barium drink milkshakes and they had me chug even more to get the best scan possible (that stuff is less than pleasant). From there I went to a GI specialist where I was seen by a nurse practitioner. She was also consulting with a doctor on staff (no appointments were available with a doctor in the immediate future at the time). By the time of this appointment my bowel movements had returned to normal. I should note that I had no other unusual symptoms during this time period, no pain, cramping, nausea or anything of that nature. When I explained this to the nurse practitioner, and she reviewed my blood work and the CAT scan, she basically told me there was no reason she could see why my amylase was so elevated. This was the first time I found out that my lipase levels were in fact normal so pancreatitis was unlikely (wish my doctor knew this because I had worked myself up that I definitely had it for the 2-3 weeks this was going on). The CAT scan results were completely normal, or ``unremarkable '' as the terminology goes. After examining my abdomen and reviewing with me the lack of other symptoms, the nurse practitioner said the other possible culprits, such as ulcers, liver problems, cancer, etc were unlikely. She spoke with the doctor and came back and let me know the most likely scenario was either that this was a one time anomaly, or that I had a condition called macroamylasemia which is benign and causes elevated amylase levels. Either way she did not think I had much cause for concern. She wrote a script for me to take a 24 hour urine sample to check for amylase levels there, and to get more blood work in a month or so. She also pointed out that if I have macroamylasemia my amylase levels have probably been elevated for a while and were most likely unrelated to the stretch of irregular bowel movements I had. The urine test came back normal but the blood work had my amylase levels still in the 400 levels. At this point I was told to go back to the GI specialist but I did n't understand why. Maybe the nurse practitioner did not explain this well, but from what she told me there was n't much more they could do for me in this situation. I do n't believe there is a way to test for macroamylasemia, although as I said I may be mistaken. As my symptoms had subsided and I was at a point in my health insurance where I 'd be paying 100% out of pocket up until October, I made the decision not to go back to the GI specialist. My logic being we were probably going to need to start a whole new batch of tests and in the end I was skeptical that they would provide any new information. I told myself if my symptoms returned I would address it then. Now I have noticed as I 've gotten older that the day after drinking I tend to have much high frequency of bowel movements. And since Thanksgiving I 've had another stretch of time where my bowel movements have noticeably increased for the first time consistently since the first episode 6-8 months back. While I do think the most likely scenario is that I have macroamylasemia, I also do n't doubt that the drinking I 've done has taken its toll on my body and my bowel issues could be related. This period since Thanksgiving has n't been a constant problem every day and has n't been as bad as the previous stretch, so I 'm not as concerned about it. But I do coincidentally have an appointment with my doctor coming up later this week just for a check up. I 'm not sure how to approach these problems with her. Past another CAT scan with imaging, I do n't know what else can be done to determine what 's going on with me. And for the problems I 'm having, I 'm not certain what the imaging will show that the previous scan did not show? Maybe a more detailed look at my liver? With my insurance I 'm back at a point where I can easily afford some expensive work, but I do n't want to do it just for the sake of having it done and then hit that donut hole in my coverage again. Once again I 'm very thankful for anyone who takes the time to read all of that and give me any feedback. Half of me feels like I 'm making too big deal out of this and that I 'm probably just a normal male around this age who has indulged in a bachelor lifestyle and whose body ca n't handle the abuse I 've put it through the same way I could in my 20s. But the other half of me is concerned I 'm ignoring what could be a potentially very serious problem.######Hi TB, I 'm not a doctor, but an X-drinker. I did n't get into trouble till my mid 50s but I 've been looking into what went wrong and I was surprised to learn drinking increases iron absorption from food, and over time, the resulting build up of iron can cause problems with the liver, which is what I believe happened to me. Your case is interesting, as high iron is also notorious for inflaming the pancreas. The genetic iron overload condition hemochromatosis was originally called ``bronze diabetes '' as people with high iron tend to tan (bronze) easily, and the pancreas is the first organ that often goes haywire with iron overload. Doctors rarely test iron levels in men, as men rarely have problems with anemia or iron overload, unless they drink for many years or have genetic hemochromatosis, which is relatively rare. Do yourself a favor and get a full iron study done. It 's a cheap and easy blood test. Be sure they include FERRITIN in the iron study, as this is sometimes left out and ferritin is the best measure of stored, built-up, total iron loading on the liver and pancreas. Be sure and get a copy of your iron labs and take a good look at them... Serum iron and transferrin saturation should not be up near the high end of the normal range, but in the middle third of the range. The upper limit for ferrritin is often set outrageously high at 300 or even 400 for men, but the newer thinking is anything well into triple digits is simply not as healthy as ferritin of 100 or less, particularly if you regularly consume alcohol. Alcohol consumption creates a lot of oxidative stress in the liver and pancreas, and iron is a very powerful pro-oxidant. Mix the two together and they can potentiate the negative effects of either high iron or alcohol alone. High iron is n't so bad if you do n't drink, and drinking is n't so bad if your iron is n't high, but when combined they can and often do cause problems. If your ferritin/stored iron is high, there 's not a lot that can be done to lower it other than blood donation, which will fix this very quickly and effectively. My ferritin was only around 200 when I got sick, but I was drinking at the time. I lowered my iron through blood donation, and GOT BETTER! Best of Luck to you!######Hi Bill, thanks for your feedback. I 've never heard of the iron build up that can result from heavy drinking before and it 's definitely something I 'll look into. What about my case makes you think that may be the problem? Did you also suffer from an otherwise unexplainable increase in bowel movements? For the past 2 weeks I 've been back up to 3 a day some days, although never more than that and sometimes back to my regular 1 or sometimes just 2. I should point out that my pancreas was not inflamed in the CAT scan I had, which is why the GI specialist ruled out pancreatitis in combination with the normal lipase levels. Also in terms of ``bronze diabetes, '' I certainly do n't tan easily. Quite the opposite, when on vacation even with my best efforts I get the slightest of tans at best. Either way I found your information interesting and like I said I will definitely read up on it more!######You 're actually still a bit young to have accumulated a lot of iron TB. I just thought of this as I developed high iron from drinking which led to trouble in my early 50s for me and the pancreas is very sensitive to high iron so this made me think you should have it checked. My early symptoms were feeling overly full and queasy for hours (like 6 hours!) after eating big meals. I think I had a fatty liver as it was uncomfortable to sleep on my right side. Then, rather suddenly, inflammation kicked in and I was sick... I quit drinking and actually felt worse for several months before I started donating blood to get my iron down. When I started feeling better after each donation, I had my iron checked and it was still elevated, even after 3 donations. Once I got my ferritin down below 50, I felt so good I wanted to drink again. Never want to go through detox again though. I 've reached an age where I 've had my fun, and want to stay healthy more than anything else now. Again, I 'm not a doctor... This was just my experience. Ruling out high iron is cheap and easy, and iron is often overlooked by doctors. Hope you get to the bottom of whatever is going on soon!######Hello, I am interested in your situation (though sorry you are stressed over it). I am in my mid 40's though, and female. I am a healthy weight and eat a healthy vegetarian diet. My ``bachelorette '' days are behind me so for me it 's little or no alcohol. Regardless of our differences though, we seem to be in the same (or a similar boat). About 3 yrs ago I went to a new dr who is the first to test for amylase. Mine was high, around 245 although lipase was normal. Like you, I went for a barrage of scary tests (including an MRI) of the pancreas, etc.. All were normal. Over the last 3 years I 've had it tested regularly and while it fluctuates slightly up and down, it never is anywhere near normal. My doctor is perplexed but unworried. At first he thought it was linked to cholesterol, but when my cholesterol goes down, the amylase goes up! My cholesterol is normal. I have no other health issues that I know of besides hay fever. The doctor wonders if perhaps I eat a bit too much carbs because the amylase is utilized in carb digestion. He thinks I might eat less of them and see what happens. I am also gluten free (!) for several years and although I eat some carbs I definitely do n't overdo and maintain a fit weight. I work out too so I feel a bit ``entitled '' to the limited carbs I do consume. Basically, I 'm not up for a carb free life so I do n't think we 'll do that experiment. Today I got results from my latest blood tests. Everything in normal range but amylase had gone up from 195 at my last visit to 245. I hope it simply comforts you to know someone else is concerned about it as well, and has been for 3 years! It 's weird knowing something is ``way off '' and not being able to know why. I 'm very big on knowing why and taking action, so this is frustrating! But if there are no associated problems, I guess we just live with it and try not to worry. I 'd be curious to know if several months later you still have elevated amylase? Good luck and best wishes!######I likely have chronic pancreatits and have just mildly elevated lipase when in a flare but all my imaging for 4.5 yrs is clear. However I have pain that goes w it. I believe I 've had it for 7 yrs with my esrly symptoms being acid reflux. Many people with cp do not have pain at first but its a progressive disease so it comes down the road. It 's a complex disease. There is a great Facebook group w lots of support and answers. Sometimes people naturally have a bit elevated enzymes but not too high..######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

For about 2 years now, I 've had elevated amylase and Lipase levels- one about 150 an the other 200. I had a MRI or cat scan done- something with four letters that stars with an M. Everything came back normal so I put the issue to rest and stopped letting it rule my life. About 1 month ago I went back for a routine check up and had my blood drawn to find that the same numbers came back for the two different tests. Spoke to my DR and he told me to not worry since the x-ray with the 4 letters was very accurate at showing something and that if it was something bad my levels would be much higher. Plus, I did n't look sick- so I went on with life. This month I had to go back to check my Liver tests since I 've started taking allopurinol for gout and we decided to include the amylase and lipase tests again... This time they were both in the 400 which has be pretty freaked out. My doctor asked me what changed in my life in the past month and a half and I let him know that due to the fact I 've been confined to the house a lot with the onset of gout attacks due to allopurinol I 've been smoking more marijuana than the usual. He seems to think this could be it. So I guess my questions are the following: * Can marijuana have to do with my increase in Amylase and lipase levels? * Is it true that if I had something bad with my pancreas, my elevations would be siginificantly higher? * Is it possible that after almost 3 years, I could have something bad but not have symptoms? Thank you so much for taking the time to answer.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

If you have to go out in these conditions perhaps you could tie a scarf around your mouth. I wish you well, Solofelix.######The winds in Vegas this week were pretty wicked. I 've been known to have asthma flares in the conditions you described. On days like that, I pull out one of my masks when I go out. One of my masks has a filter on it. I get funny looks, but it can be so hard on the body at times that I just do n't always care anymore. I can put up with the Darth Vador jokes... I ca n't put up with the not being able to breathe and coughing of the flares. They really wear me out. How are you doing today? Are you using your inhaler regularly? Do you have a nebulizer at home? It might be worth asking for one at your next visit because it can help get the albuterol into your lungs a bit better.######I have trouble with the wind too. I limit my exposure as much as possible.######Hi Neighbor, I live in Phoenix and when the wind kicked up this week I immediately got sick. I 'm on QTar, Pulimcort, a rescue inhaler and as of two days ago now have a Vios nebulizer at home delivering medicine to me. I feel your pain.

I went through it for 10 years. If you can do it without breaking the bank, have a stress test... it sounds most like angina. Angina and GERD have such similar patterns, and many people (more than coincidence I 'm convinced) have BOTH! Some SLIGHT differences... Angina can occur on an empty stomach more readily than GERD. Angina goes away when you STOP climbing the steps. GERD responds to acid blockers. Angina responds to nitrates and beta-blockers. But beware calling a discomfort after a meal GERD... angina like to act up then too. The diagnosis can elude your GP... get a good cardiologist to make the call. Short of breath when you talk or climb stairs really sounds like cardiac ischemia to me... do you get pain or burning in chest or shoulders? Can you RUN? How do you do walking fast into an icy wind? (Weird question this time of year.)######ccdean, shortness of breath:- when talking & it getting worse when climbing stairs or riding a bike can be trouble. these were the ONLY symptoms the doc prescribed an excercise test which showed clogged arteries..######-Heart-Vascular###-Heart Disorders

I 'm a 22 year old female in excellent shape and have had allergic/exercise induced asthma my whole life, which has never been a problem for me... the rescue inhaler always helped. This past April I started biking 20 miles a week and increasing my jogging distance... i literally felt the best i have ever felt in my life. Then May 1, I woke up short of breath, so i took my rescue inhaler, but it did n't help. I 've been to the ER, admitted to the hospital, and had all heart and blood tests done which all came back normal. I have been to a Pulmonary Dr. several times. I 've tried a daily corticosteroid and prednisone, both of which did n't help. Some days i feel almost normal with my breathing and some days i 'm very short of breath. I had a Pulmonary Function Test when i was very short of breath and it showed restrictive results as opposed to obstructive which suggest asthma. My total lung capacity was decreased. Then I had another PFT on a day when i felt pretty good and it came back in the normal range. The doctor does n't have an answer for me. He ca n't explain why I have restrictive attacks. I also saw an ENT and he looked down my throat and everything was normal. I feel like i ca n't inhale well and i ca n't get a deep breath. It feels very constricted at times. It 's not consistent though, because every so often i feel like i can breathe pretty good but it doesnt last long. This has completely ruined my life... i 've missed so much work and i ca n't do things i would normally do. Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you.######I should also mention that every time i 'm short of breath, even when i had the restrictive PFT results, my pulse oximetry was 100%.######You know, my PFTs are also weird that way. The total lung capacity is low-normal, but my ratio is HIGH. My peak flows are really high. Do you know what triggers these attacks? Do antihistamines help at all? Or have you tried anticholinergic inhalers (Atrovent?)######Thank you so much for answering! My peak flows are around 350. I 've used claritin D on and off for years and lately I 've been taking it everyday so my allergies wo n't aggravate my asthma and make the shortness of breath worse. I tried Pulmicort, which made my heart race and beat irregular. Then i was on Flovent for 3 weeks and i thought it might have been helping... i was still short of breath but not too bad... then one day i got severely short of breath and that 's when i had the PFT done and it showed restrictive breathing and reduced total lung capacity. My doctor then told me to stop the flovent because my asthma was obviously not causing my symptoms. It 's frustrating because i wish i just had an answer######Also, as to what triggers my attacks... they 're completely random. Before this all happened, my asthma was always triggered by something... allergies, cold air, exercising, etc.. My last attack happened when i was at work (i sit down all day and have never had an asthma attack there before) My shortness of breath just got progressively worse throughtout the day. It 's scary.######I do have asthma which i think complicates my problem. Sometimes I yawn and I feel that it opens up my lungs more, but only during the yawn. And other times, I ca n't yawn, because there just is n't enough air... it feels like my lungs just wo n't expand..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Lung & Respiratory Disorders/ COPD

My oldest daughter contracted bacterial meningitis at 11 months old. Her pediatrician at the time was a family friend that I trusted. I was 18 and had no idea of what could be wrong. She was running a high fever for about two days and was lathargic did n't want to eat or drink. I called the Dr. and they squeezed her in at the end of the day with her Dr. We got there and they were just thinking that is was a urinary track infection so they wanted a urine sample. It took forever to get one since she did not want to drink and what they did get was not very much. They took it and came back and gave me a perscription for an antibiotic and sent us home. My husband worked nights so I took her home and had her lying in bed next to me when I realized that she was starting to have a seizure. I called 911 they rushed her to the hospital. The ER Dr instantly had a feeling that it was meningitis so instantly took a spinal. As she withdrew the fluid it came out almost milky white and on top of that she did not move or cry when they did the spinal tap. They admitted her to the picu and she got worse everyday! she became septic, her kidneys were shutting down and things were not looking good. Finally she took a turn for the better and slowly got moved out in the regular pediatric floor. She was there with a pic line for two weeks or so. When they figured out what strain it was and got her on the right antibiotic she was getting better. When the time came that they decided she was ok to come home they ran all the standard tests on her to see if there was any damage. She had lost her hearing (nerve) in her left ear, but the right seemed to be still normal. I know that the Dr. had misdiagnosed her and I was so upset with it, but because he was a family friend we did not file malpractice. Here we are 10 years later, we have found out that she had a stroke during that time. Her right ear has been fine but when I took her in for her annual hearing test they told me she was having some mild hearing loss in her good ear, and that it is probably going to start fading. I know we can put a hearing aid in that ear and there is this thing called the bone anchored hearing implant they can do for her left. I know this is what we have to do for her, but the costs are going to kill us and who knows what else we are going to have to pay out of pocket for. I am not a real believer in suing and because he was a family friend and I had grown up with his kids we did not file a malpractice claim. I am just having a hard time forgiving myself for not doing that for her so that she could have the means if needed. And I am told now that it is too late to do anything now. I am trying to be strong for her, but at the same time I am so angry and upset and sad. I just wish there was something we could still do to send a message to that Dr. that rushing us out of his office almost cost us our daughter. And he just walked away without a slap on the hand.######i would definately sue. at the end of the day that is your daughter and you need to be strong for her and fight for her. even if it was my mother iwould sue. being a family friend surely they should of been EXTREMELY careful and checked every possible illness before sending her home? what would you do if you were the doctor and a friend of yours came in with their child? would you rush them through so that you could get them home? i know i wouldnt i would be even more caring and thorough. good luck and so sorry to hear that has happened to your daughter xx######My son had bacterial meningitis at three months. The doctor also said he had a UTI with a 104 fever vomiting and severe arching! He started losing consciousness the night we left the hospital. Same thing, doctor was in a rush. I am sick reading that others have had similar experiences cause I would never want anyone else to go through this. He survived... and now has several obstacles to overcome due tot the brain injury due to strokes and seizures while in a coma. Now when the doctors see me coming they give me what I want... cause I knew something was very wrong... and they messed up. Prayers with you!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

My concerns are that in reading I have found that as adults we have built up immunites against the type of bacteria this vaccine is used for. I am worried that in giving it to my baby she will not build up the ``natural '' immunities that we have as adults. I have read that the vaccine is possibly only protective until the age of 5... so what happens after that? Will they be more susceptible to this type of meningitis because they have not built up the natural immunities ?? With the vaccine being around for only 4 years there really are no answers for the long term. BUT meningitis is something I DEFINITELY want my children to be protected against. Can you share your opinions on this vaccine with me? Do you feel that it is worth getting it for the protection against meningitis? Thank you SO much !!!!######Prevnar has n't been around a very long time, but it is more than four years because our five and a half year old daughter had it when she was an infant. In my opinion meningitis is one of the most serious bacterial infections out there. If your baby goes to daycare and/or for later on in preschool I do think its a valuable vaccine. It also protects against many other bacterias which cause other types of infections. Our dd got it at nine months old. She was getting an average of two ear infections per month and I know it does n't sound like much, but the frequency dropped to about once a month a few weeks after she received the vaccine. I know a lot of folks here are not supportive of immunizations but I am one who believes that most of these diseases are much more serious than the remotely possible reactions from the vaccines. I can see their point on some such as the chicken pox vax, but for diseases such as diptheria, tetanus and meningitis I would much rather not take a chance! Nancy######There is lots of info on Prevnar if you have time to research it. Good luck on whatever decision you make. According to the 1994 Red Book Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children who are at risk of pneumococcal infections are those with specific predisposing factors. The Redbook states: (Pneumococcal Infections) are more likely to occur when predisposing conditions exist, including immunoglobulin deficiency, Hodgkin s disease, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (including HIV), nephrotic syndrome, some viral upper respiratory tract infections, splenic dysfunction, splenectomy and organ transplantation. 46 Most healthy children do not have these risk factors. I know my kids dont. Prevnar contains aluminum and according to the manufacturer there have been no carcinogenic, mutagenic or fertility studies done on the vaccine.######Just a little warning: The vaccine trial had no placebo group. It had a `control group ' of children who were given an experimental menigococcus C vaccine instead. Prevnar administered children had 4 times more seizures and they had 4 times more gastritis than the group that got the other vax. Significantly, more children who received Prevnar developed asthma. Prevnar should really be researched. We never let our children get the injection. (But we did n't do any vaccines at all.)######dear bioadoptmom3, lots of vaccines are effective for only a number of years. for instance, the tetanus vaccine is effective for a limited number of years and as an adult you have to get a booster every 10 years. that does not make it any less safe or effective. i just had my 10 year booster and i had NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL. just ask a pediatrician you trust and rest assured that vaccination is a good idea. best of luck, nbw######My friends (all that I know about) all have gotten the Prevnar series for their kids. Meningitis is a very serious disease. They have just come out with a new Meningitis vaccine that is for older kids and adolescents. It lasts 10-12 years and will be given to kids at or around age 11 and will protect them thru their college years. It is a rare disease but very serious resulting in amputations and death within a very short time of contracting it. I think the only time an adult would need to be vaccinated for meningitis would be for foreign travel. Most states require that all incoming freshmen be advised of the vaccination and the need for it especially if they are to live in a dorm. Better safe than sorry..######-Infectious Diseases Board###-Vaccination & Immunization

He got Strep B from my daughter when he was born and the dr.s said it turned into Meningitis. Has anyone else had this experience or knows about strep B Meningitis? We are devastated and will probably never recover from this loss. Melissa######My daughter 2 months is in the hospital with strep B. The doctors do n't understand how she got the infection. She is a twin and was delivered by C-section. They are doing everything they can for her. Please prey for her and I am sorry to hear of your loss. I am so scared.######I am so sorry... I will... My thoughts and prayers are with you... Much love to you and yours... Caroline######I have just found out my little nephew charlie who is only 2and half weeks old has strep B meningitis on the brain. . he was born with it and caught it off my sis-in-law during labour. He is in hospital as i speak getting brain scans and mendication as he keeps fitting and stops breathing >> > i would just like to ask u all nicely to pray for charlie and give him the strength to pull through this !! Thank you x######I was wondering what happened, I just found out my 3 week old nephew has bacterial meningitis and has a 20 percent chance. I thought maybe you would know more research and know if most likely he could pull through?######my son got strep b meningitis at 9 weeks he is now 12 weeks, spent 8 days in hospital and he kept stopping breathing also, we had the hospital chaplain come out to his bedside and he prayed with us. He is doing ok now got a special hearing test this week to see if its affected his hearing. also he has a respiratory monitor for 6 months so if he stops breathing the alarm goes off. i pray that all your babies get better soon, and for your losses i pray you comfort. xxxxxxxx######I am so sorry to hear about your loss and all the babies who are stuggling and in the hospital. My heart just aches for you all & you will be in my prayers. I had meningitis as an adult and can not imagine these precious little ones with it. I pray for their healing, wisdom for the doctors and peace within your hearts at such a scary time. CharlieJane######My son Clark was infected by strep b at 3 weeks of age while still in the nicu. It was then confirmed as bacterial meningitis. My son is now 20 months old and has had 4 brain surgeries, with each one taking a piece of my life. He has 2 vp shunts in his brain to help with the hydorcephalus and build up of fluid. He gets 6 therapy sessions a week at home (physical, speech, occupational, special instructor) and though he is limited, we and the therapists know he understands us and wants to communicate with us. Our first hope is that he knows that we love him and our second hope is that he continue to have a relationship with God, who can read his heart, even when he is n't able to say anything... Clark will one day be whole and healthy, we have strong faith in this.######my son also had strep b at 2 1/2 months. doctors do n't know how if he got it.he was born through c-section. he is 4 years old and doing good. just that his behavior changes from time to time he could he sweet one day and crying the next over anything. i need support on this one.######i was diagnosed with strep b 4 months into my pregnancy with my son who is now 8. hospital had to intrvine antibiotics into both my hands, then break me waters, this was so my son didnt contract it on his way out, i was lucky my son didnt have it. we was told i will only ever carry this infection if i was pregnant, so my husband had emergency snip, we didnt want to go through that feeling of losing your baby again. but twice this year i start losing really bad green discharge, and when have sex it smells bad of fish, went and had swobs done on both occassions, and i both times had gbs with 3 crosses, i have once again started the same way, why? can they not take my whom area away coz of this, i shouldnt even be getting it as i not been pregnant again######My daughter passed of bacterial meningitis 12 yrs ago, she was 2 1/2 months old. I carried the strep b during pregnancy. I was given meds during labor, she was the only baby that my water broke on its own and I got to the hospital with in a hour and meds probably within 2 hours... I have 5 children including Montana, all of my other children were induced and the water was broken for me well into labor, its scary... Montana was my second child, having 3 children after her I was always very nervous, my husband and I had the kids at the dr all the time and at the ER, only very few understood, but once you go through this kind of shock and lose a child its in the back of your head all the time, even now, my oldest is 15, my youngest is 5... still to this day IM SCARED. I had Montana at the Dr. 24 hrs before she passed, he sent her home and said she had a virus, the next morning my world was turned upside down... the er dr told me right away what he thought it was (bacterial meningitis) and put her on meds as soon as we got there... she was transported to a childrens hospital but it was to late, she passed away and life as i knew it was changed forever. Time has made my pain better, I now help people when they go through the toughest loss anyone of us can indure... Montana is our angel, shes looking over us everyday... Her sisters and brother... Becca, Sky, Tommy and Mary know all about thier sister in heaven and talk about her like they have met her... not a day goes by that her name isnt mentioned in our household, her pictures are everywhere... and so is her presence. I wish nothing but love to everyone here, to the babies that have beat this monster... keep fighting and good luck... to the babies that fell to this monster, keep smiling down on us, gone but never forgotten... May you fly with the angels and touch the face of GOD. < 3######I lost my niece to strep b. she was a premie baby delivered by a c section and we thought she was doing great, gaining weight and looking to be healthy. Then one morning that I happen to be there staying over night, at 5 am she was found unconcious. It has tore my sister apart and she has n't been able to recover since then, almost 4 years ago. Now my wife and I are having a baby and it 's the hardest thing in the world. Losing your child is the worst thing that could ever happen and i do n't know how to get past this fear or even where to start with my sister who was like my best friend until now....######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

However mine is not caused by Herpes Simplex 2. Therefore, there is no treatment for my illness. I am looking for any advice, specialists, or research studies. I have had 5 attacks in 2 months. Three of which had led to extended hospitalizations. It is impossible to maintain a normal life this way. Please help!######Aseptic meningitis is usually a harmless disease, and people usually have full recovery in 5 to 14 days after symptoms start. Doctors often will recommend bed rest, plenty of fluids, and medicine to relieve fever and headache. More information from the Centers for Disease Control: http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/viral/viral- faqs.htm######You have obviously never had asceptic meningitis. I would never describe it as ``harmless. '' I had it over 150 times over the course of 25 years and every time I got it, it was worse. The symptoms and feeling are the same as if you have the viral or bacterial types. The only solace you have is that you know it will remit. Meanwhile, you feel like you are dying. That, over time, is disheartening to say the least. I lost many days at work, could n't plan social engagements, and/or many other things that most people take for granted. I would get it twice a month, meaning that there were very few days during the month that I felt well enough to lead a normal life. Mine was caused by a little known reaction to NSAIDs. I hope others who have aseptic recurrent meningitis will examine their own use of NSAIDs. They could be the culprit.######I know, but my case is recurrent. it continues to come back. I have had 5 attacks from different causes in 2 months.######Id ' suggest that you contact the CDC with your specific questions. They should know where to direct you and to recommend practitioners or associations that can help. Alternatively, you can request more information from these organizations: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/ National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/ National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases, Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases: http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/######I am four days into my sixth episode of Meningitis. The headache and back pain is bad enough, but the spinal tap just makes it all worse. My attacks were more spaced out than yours; I have gone from three months to 5 years between attacks. Since there is no treatment, other than pain management, I choose not to stay in the hospital and simply go home with my painkillers and sleep for a few days until the symptoms eventually fade away. They test me each time for Herpes, AIDS and other immune deficiency disorders but the results always come back negative. In my case, four of the episodes happened during very stressful periods, i.e. university exams and a new, very stressful job, but since the other two happened while I was returning from vacation, I 'm not sure there is any correlation. I have found out more information about my condition from the internet than I ever got from my doctors. In fact, the last two times, the neurologist who was on duty at my local hospital was not at all aware of Mollaret's syndrome until I told them about it. Good luck with your research on the net. There is not a whole lot of information available, and unfortunately, no one can really tell us what makes us candidates for this syndrome. There seem to be too many variables. dj######my husband has been suffering with chronic meningitis of unknown etiology since Jan 2008, (1 yr, 2mos). His meningitis symptoms are weekly, He always has a headache, 3 to 4 days a week they are severe headaches, stiff neck and fever/chills. He has the dizzy/heavy headedness, fluctuating hearing loss, hearing sensitive and eye blurriness, auras and floaters all the time. There is no cure, however, the only treatment is steroids and pain management. In repeated reviews of his spinal fluid, his doctor advises he has a text book case for chronic meningitis. Has anyone heard or know of anyone having this type of meningitis?######My first episode of viral meningitis was in the early 1980s. 25 years ago there was very little known about it and hardly an internet on which to research. I continued to have episides once or twice a year for years. More than a dozen total. First one knocked me out of life for a few months. Last episode that I can confirm was in 1997. In 1997, I recovered within a week. My doctor had told me my immune system would do a better job each episode, and it has. I continue to periods of a day or two where I feel very sick, but not much worse than a bad case of the flu. I had some specialists tell me that meningitis does n't recur. Duh, really? Why have I been hospitalized and been confirmed with lumbar punctures more than once? During my worst periods, I had a great deal of blood withdrawn and tested. Nothing. No magic in my recovery, other than a complete change of lifestyle. Must avoid chemicals as much as possible. This means no perfumes, scented products, processed foods, synthetic fabrics, and so forth. My worst period was when I worked in a specific building; who knows what was there triggering me. Once I detoxified, I was able to tolerate some stuff but when I get sick it can usually be linked to an intensive exposure to a chemical. I continue to maintain a very healthy diet, continue to exercise despite the routine pain, and I continue to take one day at a time. I do n't live in a city and we built a healthy house. This is just what it has been for me. My doctor calls me a canary in a coal mine.######Ok, there are people like us out her who suffer from this darn recurrent aspetic meningitis. I too have had it at least three times. Hospitalized all three times. Went to Mayo Clinic for answers. They told me my recurrent meninigitis is linked to my chronic migraines. There is no specialists out there to help. I do not have herpes, or any known cause for this after many many tests and procedures. There has got to be someone who can help. Julie/ Chicago Illinois######Just a quick question... did any of you had the meningitis vaccine and were you healthy prior to the vaccine if you in fact had it? I ask because my 15 year old daughter had the meningitis vaccine last September and has had recurrent ``viral '' illnesses almost every 4-8 weeks since. Illnesses always look the same... fever, headache, sore throat and neck stiffness/pain. They resolve in about a week, but knock her out completely when present.######The meningitis vaccine only helps the bacterial Meningitis. It will not help viral or aseptic or recurrent meningitis. I asked hoping too that it would stop the reoccurence. Too bad for us! Momto3girls, did you daughter have spinal taps to verify viral meningitis? What doctor are you seeing regarding her getting viral meningitis after the vaccine? A Nuero or your regular GP?######She has not been diagnosed with anything specific as of yet. We are just starting to develop a theory of what is going on. I took a perfectly healthy girl in last September to get this vaccine, and she has been sick intermentally since. The symptoms and duration are always the same, and she has tested negative for strep, mono multiple times, and CBC reveals nothing of significance. I find the timing of the vaccine and her illnesses suspect and am trying to find a reason why.######Momto3girls, She needs a spinal tap to check for meningitis. It is the only way to completely confirm meningitis. If it is viral or bacterial it will show that through cultures of the spinal fluid.######Wow, I can not believe that I have VSM again. I am a 45 year old woman, I had VSM 3 times prior to this. So I do n't need a spinal tap to know what I have. All the past bouts where within a 6 year period starting at age 16 and my last at age 23. A life time has passed since then, each bout was less severe than the first, by the third time I did n't go in for a spinal tap, just ibupropen and rest. I do not have HSV, I do not get headaches. I have been under a lot of stress this past year. Another wierd thing I have that I can not find answers to is a chronic, recurring itch on my arms (just my arms). I ca n't see anything unusual about my skin. This itch went away for 2 years but has returned in the last 7 weeks. It responds to antihistimines. Are these things related anyone? I eat a very healthy diet (minus the 1 cup of coffe each morning with a teaspoon of sugar). I prepare almost 100% of our food from scratch. We only consume 100% grassfed meat, diary, eggs, etc all raised by a local rancher we know (animals do n't get any healthier than this- totally ``beyond organic ''). Almost all vegies are local, fresh and ``beyond organic ''. We are thin and get good exercise and are active. I do n't use lotions, or cosmetics, no deodorant, no chemical cleaners, no dioxins. My work envirnonment is not too bad and I work in bouts and not very much). I use Dr Bonners Soap. I do not have any health issues other than the itch and now, apparently, recurrent VSM. OMG. I am starting to get worried. What could all this mean and how do I get better? A detox would be good start, does anyone know of a place where I can go for a detox program that will not force veganism on me?######I 've been dealing with what appears to be Mollaret's for 2 years now. My experience is almost exactly 2 weeks long each time with fever, intense headache and severe neck pain. For almost the entire first year it was 2 weeks of ``flare up '' followed by 3 weeks off. 2 on, 3 off, etc.. I had upwards of 60 + tests (almost 30 blood draws), CT scans, ultrasound, xrays, urine tests and other stuff and out of 8 doctors including 3 specialists, none have ever come close to a diagnosis. All I get is ``It 's a virus, it 'll pass ''. Each round is less severe than the previous round. After the 1st year the symptoms started occurring less often. Now I 'm at about 2 months in between flare ups... but the flare up is still 2 weeks long. At first my fever was 103-104, now I rarely hit 101. Other than 4 hours in the emergency room during the first round I have simply just lived with it. In fact, the first round I spent 2 weeks in bed. The second time I got it my wife's advice was ``Just suck it up. '' As much as I hate to admit it, it was the best advice I 've received. I have endured each bout since without missing work or other functions... and now knowing that there is nothing else I could be doing for it makes her advice even more accurate. I 'm currently in a new flare up that started about a week ago and about 4 days ago while researching for the umpteenth time I stumbled across Mollaret's. The clinical description of the symptoms so describes what I have that I consider it a near certainty. Unfortunately I will probably never know as I do not want a lumbar puncture (my grandfather died while getting one). Since the doctors have excluded everything else and have long given up on me I 'm going to dump my research on them and see if they concur. At this point I 'll settle for a diagnosis by exclusion. The only unknown is what might be causing it? I 've been tested (negative) for all the various viral sources I 've seen listed and have never had any herpes sores, nor do I lead a life style that would have gotten be infected with herpes. The only possibility I can think of is herpes zoster... the Chicken Pox virus. Once you have it, it will be (normally) dormant in your nerves the rest of your life. If it does flare up it usually results in a case of shingles... which I had last decemeber. Coincidental? Absolutely. But still something I 'm considering.######I too ran across Mollaret's and proposed it to my doctors. But still, I spent years trying to find the cause. Three years ago, I found an article that mentioned that NSAIDs can cause recurring aseptic meningitis. I had always taken lots of aspirin, ibuprofen and other NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for back pain. I wo n't go near an NSAID now and have not had a recurrence since stopping them three years ago. If you are taking any, stop, and see if this my be the answer.######do n't be so reliant on CDC.Gov these guys do n't even care about bacterial development in soil by the average gardener using organic but un-natural amounts of bacteria for composting and soil conditioning which leads to anti-biotic soil types that let bacterias like Strepococci Bacilius become antibiotic resistant as well as a host of other bacterias. that is why we have seen and increase of E-coli resistant bacteria, Salmonella Resistant Bacteria and others that even eat you flesh off. Why these unwitting chemist are using manure from Cows, chickens, goats and pigs which is part of their soil conditioning which leads to mutations of bacterias found in these animals.######OMG.Thank you for all your inputs. I 've finally found other people who have same problems. I had viral meningitis 10 years ago and for every year now, I 've been getting these symptoms 2-4xs a year. I 'm 8 weeks pregnant and not sure why it started other than maybe my immune system is down. I just wish there was a way to stop them or to relieve some of these symptoms. And I really thought I was losing my mind, but I now know there others that are suffering too.######Reading the above posts it 's the first time that I 've heard other people talk about something that has also happened to me. On at least 6 occasions dating back over 12 years I have had occurrences of Viral meningitis. The first three times culminated in week long stays in hospital and the enevitable lumber punctures which simply confirmed what I already knew from the first experience. Whilst the occurrences are less severe each time they are still debilitating and extremely unpleasant. There have been generally at least year between occurrences and I have taken lots of steps to improve my lifestyle including weekly acupuncture and yoga. Also initially cutting out caffeine and eating healthily. The one common factor for me with all episodes has been a hectic work like with too much adrenalin induced stress. I must say that it is comforting to hear for the first time that there are others out there with the same issue.######Hi. A year ago I was hospitalized with viral meneangitis. Every 6 to 8 weeks it seems I get hit with a flu like ilness that feels just like my first bout with with VM, only it is not as acute and does not lay me up for as long. I m writing this as I just spent my memorial day weekend in bed with the same symptoms. My question is do any of you ever expeience lower abdominal pain during this. I can usually tell when a bout is coming on because my very lower abdoman and lower back start to ache and burn. Hurts so bad I cant bend over to put shoes on. My bowel movements are normal, but there is a persistant sharp pain, that usually goes away in a bout 4 days. In a week my headach and body aches and weekness go away too. This is happening too much like clock work to believe that I am catching the same flu bug over and over. Looking forward to your comments and feedback Thank you. - Kurt######Hi. It may be a long shot but maybe my situation is similar to someone elses. I was diagnosed with aseptic meningitis 11 years ago. I had migraines for over a year, every day and have lived with challenging side effects that seemed similar to Fibromyalgia. I have never been quite the same since the infection. I ended up being tested for a co-infection of Lyme disease even though I did n't remember a tick bite or rash which is typical of up to 50% of patients. If you have a Lyme infection and do not get appropriate treatment, it can cause lots of problems including neurologic symptoms. The co-infection called Ehrilichia chaffeenosis or human monocytic ehrlichia was the cause of my meningitis and crazy symptoms. The trick to getting tested for Lyme is that most of the current tests are not accurate enough, so getting the right tests and through one of the three labs the specialists recommend, is essential. If anyone is getting recurring symptoms, do n't give up looking for answers. You may also want to consider antivirals and looking into supplements to increase your immune functioning. You might want to find a doctor who looks at the overall picture, including if you are low on certain vitamins or have other deficiencies. If a doctor ca n't help, find another one that can & keep moving forward to find answers. Best wishes######Hi, thanks for all your stories, I to have had aseptic meningitis 3 times. real bad like 8 years ago. i was told i would never get it again. Not true. 2 years ago in October 2010 I got it again, than again a few months ago. the second time in 2010 i had went blind shortly after i arrived at the hospital it was so bad I spent 3 day in ICU, TOTALLY knocked out because i became a mad woman destroying everything in site, I was told. This last time i caught it in time, but still spent 6 days in hospital. i dont think i will ever be 100% i have bad memory loss, literally feel, well for a lack better words i feel slow. each time this has happened there has been an extremly high amount of stress in my life, i really believe it has something to do with it.Just dreading if and when it will happen again !!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

I 'm not anemic but I do have problems with my ferritin levels. Let me explain. I have a thyroid problem but can not tolerate thyroid meds. I also have crohn's disease which includes inflammation, infection and near constant intestinal bleeding. My ferritin has tested low several times, 10 or lower, but within a short amount of time of taking iron pills my ferritin jumps to a high normal (I always thought raising ferritn levels was a slow process). Other times my ferritin is high or high normal yet my iron is too low. Its my understanding that inflammation and infection can give a false high ferritin level. Right? How high can a false reading go? What does it mean when my iron is too low yet ferritin is high- is this a false high? Doctors seems to ignore my ferritin- if its too low they do n't care and if my ferritin is good yet my iron is too low they ignore this too. Right now I have a lot of symptoms but I can not be sure if its from my thyroid or low ferritin: extreme hair loss, mood swings, hot flashes, irritable, slurred speech, arms feel numb sometimes, stiff fingers in the morning, restless sleep. I 've stopped taking my thyroid meds, yet again, because this seems to only make things worse. Technically, I 'm subclinical so without thyroid meds my normal hormone levels are within range just on the low side, not optimal. Can someone attempt to explain the relationship with ferritin, iron, thyroid and inflammation?######robinhy-- Welcome to the boards! I will try to answer your questions. Ferritin is an iron storage protein that the body synthesizes, FREE iron can be toxic to our organs. To prevent iron toxicity the body regulates the level of ferritin (synthesis) to accommodate different levels of iron. Ferritin is stored in the bone marrow and organs. Ferritin is used (called on) when the need for iron intake increases to build the Hgb so that you do not become anemic. When the iron stores are depleted, iron is then pulled from the organs, this is a more dangerous stage. When your total body iron is high ferritin is usually high, when total iron body is low, ferritin tends to be low as well. ~ Iron deficient people ~ tend to have a ferritin less than 10 whatever the bottom of your range is. My Hematologist says under 10, there is no iron remaining. Ferritin can also be confusing in the presence of inflammation as you mentioned, because it is an ~ acute phase reactant ~, and can also be. For example, i.e., if you have an with iron deficiency anemia you can be iron deficient with a very high ferritin. The end stage of the ferritin stores is IDA iron deficiency anemia. So until the iron stored are used up you will not become anemic. Anemia MAY not show until your ferritin is 5 or below around this range anyway. It is different for each person. Yes, inflammation/infection can give a false ferritin level. This reading would be different for each person I have not read a certain level anywhere. I know it is elevated in different settings so who knows how high it can go. My husband had a 3,000. ferritin for a different reason. So typically ferritin will rise depending on the cause. You can also seek further testing regarding inflammation to see how high it is elevated in your body. A simple blood test CRP and SED rate will give you these answers. Perhaps you have also had this testing as well. But it will show inflammation. With that being said, the Iron study gives the amount of iron in circulation in the body at the time of blood testing. For example from what you eat, supplements, a total iron intake, the iron serum reflect this. So, if you have recently eaten iron rich foods, like steak, or taken iron supplements it will show in the iron serum. If you took iron and had a blood test it could skew the results. Doctors rely on the ferritin for sure !!!! If it is not high over range they do n't care, if it is too low but within range they do n't care too much either. And... if it is a little low below range but you are not anemic yet, they still do n't care too much. It is up to you unfortunately to know what is happening. I know my Hematologist said, anything under ten and over one thousand he is concerned, because that is when you to store too much iron and overload. And... under the 10 mark you become anemic. Ferritin is more telling of the stored iron in the body and can be falsely elevated. Iron studies tell about the iron in circulation in the bloodstream. Excess iron that is not used is then stored. So, if you are not taking in enough iron you will be using stored iron. If there is blood loss there is iron loss. This will deplete your stores over a period of time. Any blood loss = iron loss. Malabsorption also results in iron loss and other nutrients. Have you had your B-12 tested? It can cause several of the symptoms that you mention, as can iron and thyroid. And could possibly be a result of Crohn's disease. Thyroid can also cause heavy periods and less stomach acid resulting in less iron absorption. Many people that are Hypo-T also have a low ferritin it is very common. Symptoms of Thyroid, Anemia and low ferritin can be very much alike. It is hard to tell what is happening you have to reply on blood tests for this and how well you respond to therapy. When you have multiple problems it is best to work on one at a time and rule out each possible thing that is happening. It can be a daunting task but it does work. I would start by taking the right amount of iron that is needed and do whatever it is that your doctor recommends regarding your thyroid. You can be in range and have a great deal of problems. If you require meds then try to take them. I know it can be hard. You can have more problems in the end if you do not supplement thyroid hormone if it is needed. Hope that helped a little. Take care and keep us posted. FLFLOWERGIRL######I know it has been awhile since this was posted but very helpful.

My HG is 11.2 and Hematocrit is 33.6. I have been having really nasty panic attacks due to the feelings of dizziness and the ``rubber or jelly '' legs. Has anyone had these symptoms? I am taking Slow FE three times a day. Do you start to feel a little better after a week or so? I just want the dizziness and aches to go away. I feel like I am going crazy !!!######Different people respond differently to anemia. I was down to a hemoglobin of 7 with my hematocrit running 26 and lower, before I started experiencing shortness of breath and then feeling like I had jelly legs. So people react differently. As for responding to the treatment, I had to have an infusion because my body did not respond to the oral iron until after they had raised it intravenously to near 10. Now I am holding my own at around 12 but my serum ferritin remains low. A low ferritin level does not cause symptoms because it is stored iron, it is the immediately available iron that determines energy levels etc.. I hope this helps..######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

The regular iron test is your active iron. From what I 've read, you can have a normal regular iron level and be very low in Ferritin. I 'm not sure how stored iron can be more important than active iron though. Maybe someone else can explain that.######Low ferritin is a precursor to anemia. So your serum iron levels can be normal while your storage protein, ferritin is very low. Low ferritin will interfere with thyroid hormone conversion as well as reducing the activity of thyroid peroxidase. In short, it 's essential for normal thyroid metabolism. Low ferritin will mimic hypothyroidism, causing many of the same symptoms. So getting your ferritin tested and the levels up to the 70-90 range is essential to successful thyroid hormone replacement..######-Endocrine###-Thyroid Disorders

At that time I was told my iron level was 118 with normal range being from 120-261. Another doctor who had the same results, quoted my level to be 8. I think they were referring to two different things. Is one ferritin and the other iron? I am confused. Anyway, after being on iron for three months, I had more bloodwork and was told that my level was now 16. I am assuming that this is good news. Does anyone know what these numbers mean, and what the normal range is? I am totally lost here!######It sounds as if the 8 and 16 are referring to the Ferritin. This number reflects the storage of iron and is usually the ``gold standard '' test for iron deficiency. Do not confuse low or ``deficient '' iron levels with anemia. One can be very low in iron and not anemic. However, very low iron levels over time can lead to anemia. Iron Deficiency Anemia is one of the most common forms of anemia especially in menstruating women. It is usually very easy to correct with simple iron supplements. The fact that your Ferritin level has already risen by 8 points is a very good indication of your ability to respond to the supplements. Althouth 16 is still considered ``low '' is it not classified as ``deficient. '' Once your Ferritin level falls below 10 it reflects a lack of adequate storage to contribute to replenishing your blood supply on a regular basis and can lead to anemia. I would guess you are no longer anemic? Check your Hgl score. This should be 12-15 for women although 11 is considered normal for some. Hope this helps.######The numbers that you quoted sound more like Serum Iron which is the larger numbers, and Hemoglobin which are the lower numbers. The serum iron level is how much iron is available in the blood. The hemoglobin is how much oxygen is carried in the blood by the red blood cells. The Ferritin level is the amount of stored iron that is held in reserve over the amount needed on a daily basis to provide iron to the blood. It is all confusing, but if you have a diet that is adequate in iron nutrients then the supplement is quite enough. Usually, there has to be a disease process going on to keep iron supplements from being adequate.######Thank you both for responding! It is so nice to be able to depend on these boards for answers. I do n't know what I 'd do without it!.######-Heart-Vascular###-Anemia

I have been having chronic pain for almost 7 years now. The pain in pinpointed in the mid of my spine, like a square, also including the muscles around my ribs. It is now moving under my breasts, spreading still from the mid back. It hurts all of the time, with no intervention. I am currently taking tramadol for the pain, but it does n't really help that much and I do n't want to go stronger. I have had MRI's & X-Rays and nerve conduction tests, and everything came back normal. My suspicion (that can not b proven) is the same time this started, I had a C-section, and the anthologist took 17 times to get the medicine properly working. I have been to chiropractic's and PT before, and both hurt so bad, I was n't sure what to do. At first, I thought it was my posture, bc I will admit, my sitting posture is HORRIBLE. So, I worked on that, but to no avail. Also, just in case it matters, I am not thin, I weigh about 230 and I am 5 ' 7, so that is what it is all blamed on. I have been in SERIOUS pain for the past week, which ended in a trip to the ER, because I could n't move without pain. I wake up and go to sleep with pain. I have been labeled everything one can b, but still no answers. I have lately been looking at autoimmune and other such causes but could use some advice from a doc. What should/can I do?######what do you mean your sitting posture is horrible?############According to a recent report, pain is experienced uniquely by individuals and that treatment often requires a combination of therapies and techniques..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Back Pain

It 's been around four months since I first got the infection symptoms. However I 'm in desperate need of advice as the doctors have firmly said I do not have m.e. (absolutely no sense of tiredness above normal, no headaches, light sensitivity etc.) and I do n't feel I fit the normal post viral symptoms either (no nausea, dizziness, tiredness etc.) What I do have is a bunch of neurological symptoms, most of which seem to have passed (I hope): burning or tingling in the fingertips and some toes, muscle twitches, pins and needles. The other problems are muscular. I have awful muscle pain in all four limbs. Two rheumatologists have examined me a number of times and have ruled out fibromyalgia. The pain is awful and seems to get worse the more I try and do. A week ago i finally noticed some improvement. I can stand for a few minutes and walk a little more before the pains in my legs start to become worse, and for a few days I felt a lot better with much less pain and was able to do more. Alas I dipped back after five days and the pain is a bit worse again. I am desperate to hear from someone who had similar problems as to how they recovered. I am hoping the run of good days finally indicates the start of my recovery but how do I hold on to that? Do I continue to do nothing when I start to feel a little better or does the body have to be pushed to remind it that I would like to be able to do more now? Really would appreciate your thoughts. I have conflicting advice from my g.p. and rheumatologist on this. Should I just gently increase and ride out the dips afterwards? Thanks so much! P.s. happy stories only please! My rheumatologist is convinced this will burn itself out and the only thing I have is my hope right now so pls. need to hear from those with positive outcomes. Thanks so much in advance!

I can not give you any advice regarding hypnotherpy unfortunately. You state ``they wo n't give me a scan yet ''. Do I understand correctly that your doctors have not okayed for you to have X-rays and an MRI scan? If that is the case, then I will highly recommended that you see a highly respected neurologist/spinal surgeon and have them authorize for you to have an MRI. Without an MRI and X-rays the doctors are just going to be guessing. Do search out the very best neurologist/spinal surgeon that you can find in your area. Please do correct me if I do not understand your post correctly. Take care. RichT######Hi Rich, Many thanks for the reply. I live in the UK so we get our heathcare under the NHS system.

The pain is not linked to infection. He can only lie on his left side or back, due to the painful condition of his right hip area. He can not put any weight on his right leg without severe pain, and can only walk with either crutches or a walking frame. He suffers 24/7 chronic pain focused on his right hip, right knee, and the intervening muscles, Similar pain radiates up his right side and into the base of his neck. and across his lower back. Separate pain, which he ascribes to Parkinson's, focuses on his right shoulder, and down to and beyond his elbow joint. This arrived in the last 18 months or so, and seems irrespective of use, or rest or application of heat. He is currently taking no pain medication whatsoever, neither analgesic nor NSAID, and has not done so for many months, due to inability to find an effective medicine or one which did not cause fluid retention. He has tried Morphine but this was found to give early undesirable side effects and little relief. Tramadol was taken intermittently for perhaps 3 years and gave no relief. Fentanyl was administered via spinal infusion during distraction of femur & pelvis but gave no relief. Paracetamol at below maximum dose gave no relief but resulted in fluid retention.

When I put all my symptoms together, it adds up to fibromyalgia, but the rheumatologist says one or more of my nerves shorted and is sending out crazy pain signals.

Without one influence of our vagus nerve called ``vagus tone '', our resting heartbeat, would be around 115 bpm. Vagus tone slows it down to around 72 bpm. Athletes have increased vagus tone and much lower resting heart beats than people that are out of shape. You do not have to have heart disease to have problems with vasovagal syncope or your vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is the nerve of the muscle in the throat and the larynx, and is the nerve that slows the rate of the heartbeat and supplies the parasympathetic nerves to the lungs, the stomach, the esophagus, and other abdominal organs. Arasympathetic means the nerves pertaining to the autonomic nervous system; the system which is concerned with control of involuntary bodily functions. Stimulating the parasympathetic nerves generally produces; contracts the pupils; causes copious secretion of the saliva; and increases gastrointestinal activity. Usually, when this happens, the heart's ventricles start beating on their own despite continued vagal stimulation. In the moment-to-moment regulation of heart rate at rest, the vagal influence is dominant and, particularly in athletes with low resting heart rates, this `vagal tone ' can be considerable. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is associated with increased nervous system activation and increased heart rate, but one type, hypovolemic hypotension, occurring after hemorrhage or certain drugs, induces a decrease in heart rate. ..######-Heart-Vascular###-Heart Disorders

I stumbled upon them and hoped others with similar symptoms could relate and help me out. I have suffered and endured Chrons since i was 12. For the past 12 years i have been on a diet that excludes dairy, wheat (and glutten), sugar, and pork. Of course as hard as i have tried, i have not been perfect on this, but i have done my best and it has kept me far clear of surgery. But i am worried about the effects of chrons and what it could lead to. I have had this occur several times. Either after physical activity or getting up and not eating breakfast, i will begin to shake, feel weak, slight dizziness, and have chest pain or atleast shortness of breath. I always feel it is low sugar so i rush to eat something. Generally i regain strength and go on my way. But sometimes the feeling lasts all day. It feels like i never catch my breath. Could this be a sign that diabetes is setting in? Im just curious and looking for answers. Thanks in advance to any advice or suggestions.######I have the same dibetic symptoms, but I do n't have chron's disease... well they do n't know WHAT I have after 5 months of testing for everything under the sun! I am curious to know why I am having these diabetic-like symptoms also. I am going to look some information up and if I find anything out I 'll post it.######Corey, it sounds like hypoglyceamia, which can be a precursor to diabetes, but not necessarily. A few simple tests can determine if you are hypoglyceamic; blood insulin and glucose tests and a glucose tollerance test. Your feelings of being weak and dizzy if you do n't have breakfast or if you workout are similar to ones I experienced before I cut refined carbs out of my diet. It could be that you 're not getting enough energy from balanced meals since you 're not eating most of the foods that qualify as `highly refined ' (gluten, sugar and dairy). When you remove these from your diet you need to replace them with healthy fats and more protein- protein is especially important with respect to blood sugar as this can be used by your body to create glucose when it is needed. Crohns does n't mean you 'll end up with diabetes, they are both autoimmune disease, however and when you have one your risk of developing another goes up- but it is not a given that you 'll get one. My husband has had Crohns for 10 years and by avoiding gluten as you are doing he has been med free for 4 years- he stays healthy as long as he does n't ovedo the wheat products. He is more sensitive to sugar but I believe that is just something that is particular to him- he 's a big guy and he can get away with it. Have you doc give you the necessary tests to put your mind at ease and perhaps do a little searching for information on the Glyceamic Index of foods- using this can help you control your blood sugar and avoid those nasty side effects. Cheers, Nat######Thanks Nat Thats some helpful information######Some of the probiotic formulas have supposedly helped suffers of Chrons Disease.

You can buy a Glucose Tester at Wal Mart for about$ 9. and 50 test strips for$ 22 and use it to find out what is going on or you could go to a Doctor. I found out using a tester that all foods and drinks are not equally absorbed. WE are all different !!! Several of the Low Carb Diet books say-- you should eat something every 5 hours.######I read a book by dr (maybe its phd) Jordan Rubin. he suffered from Chrons disease, nearly died. but recovered by drastically changing his diet. i have not tried out this diet yet. but he actually explains in scientific terms, and gives you proper foot notes of the mentioned studies. that explain various aspects of digestion to you. basically its going to an all organic diet, which should give you the correct amounts of micro = ogranissms that help you digest your food. and i dunno eh spoke a lot about Chrons disease and his battle with it and he eventually won. the book does take a searous religious tone about diet but also has founded science in it... its only like 14$ to buy one so maybe you should give it a shot. or loan it form your local library for free. i would think very good eating habbits would be the place to start for anything GI related. and its been prooven inorganic food is not as good as organic food for us....######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

My doctor recommended masturbation for some prostrate issues I was having and it seems to be helping-- however, I am experiencing clay like stools and bouts of diarrhea. Can this be caused by masterbation? Any thoughts? Wondering, littlegeneral######There 's no connection at all. Your body does n't know what caused your orgasm, masturbation or partner sex: -)######Yep, agree w/Sparkleflower. I 've never heard of any bowel problems after masturbating. Z######Could you be triggering some sort of anxiety that 's giving you diarrhea? Sounds far-fetched, but possible...############I have to agree with all the above posts. THe stimulation and sensation of masturbation itself will not cause diarrhea. Though there have been a lot of studies that show that anxiety can occur during masturbation. Also, anxiety is linked to your bowels and is a major cause of irritible bowel syndrom which has diarrhea as a side effect.######Anxiety seems rather likely. Especially if you 've started associating masturbation with diarrhea. Another possibility is something known as runner's trots. Sometimes when people go jogging they get stomach cramps and diarrhea. I am not sure what manner you are masturbating in, but it 's definitely possible that you 're getting so worked up that you 're giving yourself a form of runner's trots.######For myself I ca n't see my doc telling me to masterbate to good health.But I suppose if a beer a day is ok, so is masturbating by doctors advice..######-Men###-Sexual Health- Men

I was put onto Zoloft for about 4 days but I had diarrhea from it and I was so miserable that I could n't keep it up. Now I have been prescribed Lexapro. I took it last night, and this morning I did n't have diarrhea but I URGENTLY had to go in the morning. Anyone have any experience with diarrhea and Lexapro? How long it will last? I am currently only taking 5mg until this passes, then I will go up to 10mg. I have this fear of having like, constant uncontrolable diarrhea at work, and I 'd like to be able to either put this fear to rest or get off of this medicine before this happens !!!######I had some problems w/ this when I first started Lexapro, 5mg. I had nausea and diarrhea for about 2-3 days, then it passed as my body adjusted to the new med. When I increased to 10mg, I had a little bit of it again, but it passed quickly. When I increased to both 15mg and 20mg, I did n't have any of that at all. I think it 's normal, and just your body adjusting. It 's annoying and gross, but it should pass. Give it a few more days. If the Lexapro ends up working for you, it 'll all be worth it in the long run. Good luck!.######-Mental Health Board###-Anxiety

I know vomiting during them is somewhat common, but have n't heard much about diarrhea. I 've been having anxiety-attack episodes that I 'm not sure are anxiety or a physical problem and every time I have one, I get the urge to move my bowels and then I have diarrhea for the next couple of days. It 's weird. Are you also more vulnerable to anxiety when becoming ill? Because I notice I get these episodes often right before I come down with a flu, sinus infection, or respiratory infection or as I 'm recovering. However, when I 'm acutely ill. . such as when I had a bad sinus infection last week, I do n't feel any anxiety at all. When I had a fever (102F at one point), I felt very lethargic and like heck, but I also felt very mellow.######``when I get nervous I have to run to the bathroom, happens everytime. Often it causes the panic to dissipate because I am concentrating on something else. So as annoying as it is, I do n't mind it. I do n't usually have it for days, unless I am under stress for days. Abby######Diarrhea has always been one of my symptoms due to stress, I think it 's common for those of us who suffer from anxiety, stress, panic etc.. When I am physically sick, my mind is on that & I think that is what you did, your mind went to the physical illness & you did n't have your mind on anxiety.

The CT scan seems to reveal pancreatic absesses, formed (from what I read on the net) from infected pseydocysts. The first operation was complicated with massive blood loss and a part of the infected pancreas was n't removed due to the complication. He has been on anti-biotics continually for 7 weeks now. My question: We have had a tough time throughout this whole process and I would like to know the complications that can set in from further open surgery, they might re-enter through the original cut to drain all the abscesses. If the draining operation is done and the abscesses clear, is it something that can re-occur? He lost a lot of weight and does n't need insuline or other enzyme producing medication. Is there a risk to this surgery? Is the pancreatic abscesses the ``last '' complication we can expect from the original operation? The doctor's have not been providing a lot of information...######I had the same operation on November 20 had drains put in and removed been on the anti-biotics 2 to 3 diffrent ones at a time been in out of hospital lost over 60 pounds. I do n't know if there is an end. my doctor told me there was 25% chance that i would never be rid of the pain. Yesterday feb. 22 i was told that i was in that 25%. I hope and pray for you and your husband that he wo n't fall in that 25% My next step is going to be Sloan Kettring in NYC######I developed acute pancreatitis and psuedo cysts from gaulstones and lost most of my pancreas. 1.5 years later my spleen was removed. This was several years and many operations ago. I have to take enzymes and still deal with pain management, but you can live. Your whole world has to change. You will need to support your husband and amend your life as well. Try to understand that the pain he is in will be real- even years later. The open surgery will take several months to heal and this is critical- NO LIFTING- This can cause a hernia and more operations. Absolutely NO LIFTING for about 6 months of anything over a couple of pounds. There also might be drainage and the wound might reopen a little to purge waste. This in not that abnormal. 2 of my wounds did have this happen weeks later. Low fat diets are a key to survival. Small meals also. Get all of your medical records including surgery notes- Have them reviewed by someone you know and trust in the medical feild that is not a current Dr of your husbands. This is to insure that all is on the up and up. If you live near a local Univeristy that has a good medical program, you may want to start going there. They tend to be up on new issues were most intrinched Dr's are not. Good luck######i had a slenectomy and distal pancreatectomy on the 25 august could someone tell me how long the recovery time is as i still have pain some days worse than others. many thanks s######I had my distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy on 7/30/10, and was hospitalized four more times after surgery for complications-- mostly due to fistula and abscess. My last time in I went into septic shock and they drained almost 350cc of horrible goop out of my abdomen. If you read up on these procedures, the complications occur in 60% or more of cases. So, you 're not experiencing anything out of the ordinary, but frightening nonetheless. It has been over a year and a half, and while I am much better, I still suffer from abdominal cramping, weird bowel movements and a little bit of nausea at times. I have taken replacement enzymes (Creon) in various doses, and that seems to help a little. Still, no one can tell me conclusively whether I 'll ever feel like my ``old '' self. The thing that I keep in mind is that regardless of the minor inconveniences I have to bear, I have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I am alive. Even though my type, non functioning neuroendocrine, is much rarer and follows a much more indolent course even if it does recur. I have done significant research and have found that even patients with recurring or metastatic disease can live a long time. It 's not the death sentence that adenocarcinoma tends to be. Still, there have been patients with adeno who have also lived much longer than the odds. My best advice is this: BE POSITIVE, and be your own advocate. Ask questions, do research; the internet has a wealth of information that can make you better informed. Question and or ask for clear explanations about everything. Join a group like PANCAN and Gilda's Club so that you can get all the support you can get, even beyond family members and close friends. My doctor tells me that he does n't like to talk in terms of cure, but he does n't tell me not to go out there and live. Believe me, everyday is precious and there is always someone else out there less fortunate. Good luck to all of you! Bob Fort Lauderdale, Florida######Bob, Nice to know another person that has been through the same thing. I had my operation 1/26/10. I too, had a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.

In June I experienced severe pain in the left upper quadrant. My PCP sent me for a CT.. This showed a large collection of fluid in the upper left quadrant. My PCP sent me back to the surgeon. I was told since I was not in pain at the time I saw the surgeon (5 days after the initial onset of pain) that there was no problem. I again had pain on July 8th. On July 10th I needed a drainage tube placed to drain what the surgeon referred to as a pancreatic pseudocyst-- 750 ml of fluid was drained. The tube was removed on July 17th. The surgion said after removing the drainage tube that the pancreatic tail had been clipped during the splenectomy. A CT on July 22nd shows an increasing amount of fluid in a mass located next to the tail of the pancreas. Is it common for the pancreas to be damaged during a splenectomy? The surgeon says this problem will resolve itself in time. Since the last CT shows increasing fluid, I am concerned that it may need surgical intervention to take care of the damaged pancreas. Is it possible this problem will resolve itself, OR is is likely surgical intervention will be needed to take care of this?######It is possible, how is it now? If it has not resolved you may have developed a fistula. If that is the case then you may require a pancreatojejunostomy. I had this procedure done in 2002 and 10-2009.

Just do n't take it too late in the evening as it is stimulatory and may stop you getting to sleep.

When my blood sugar starts getting low, I will feel weak, sometimes shake a little, often have a crawling sensation across the top of my head and even feel hot. This triggers adrenaline which can make your heart rate and/or blood pressure change as well. I am guessing the anxiety of having blood taken (I have situational anxiety as well), may have triggered your low blood sugar attack. I would advise if you plan to give blood in the future that you eat a high protein meal (like low fat meat, cheese, or an egg or two) within an hour of giving blood. That should help stabilize everything for you. Best of luck! Lindaru.######-Health Issues###-General Health

My platelet count dropped to 4,000. They gave me prednisone for a long time and the count kept dropping after the the dosage was reduced. In early tests my spleen was n't functioning abnormally and I did not have any form of cancer. My eukaryocytes were abundant. But somehow the count was still dropping. I took matters in my own hands and did a lot of research. Ascorbic acid (vitamin c) fights off infections. I took four ascorbic acid tablets per day. My platelet count lingered around 70k. Then slowly began to drop again. The vitamin c had some effect to say the least but did not stop the pestilence. Since that was n't quite the answer, I did research on other vitamins. The potassium vitamin actually caught my attention first. It seems that potassium is an antagonist to rat poison. Rat poison makes the rats bleed internally. Potassium strengthens cells. After I started taking the potassium with ascorbic acid, my platelet count jumped to eighty thousand. Three months later, it was at 120,000. Now it has been three more months and I have n't experienced any negative affects. It seems the disease has lost its potency. I no longer have nose bleeds, fatigue, nor ruptures underneath my skin. I 'm not saying this is the answer for everybody... But it seems to be working for me. Sadly the doctors laughed it off. It seems they are more afraid of losing money from the drug companies but i 'd rather not conclude that. It is just a thought. And there is always the chance that there is another reason why it just got better on its own. This is n't likely considering nothing worked until I took these vitamins. I was just ecstatic when I started to get better. Overall, I recommend for any suffering individuals to try this treatment. This is n't for cancer patients, etc.. Obviously. It may or may not work, but when I was sick I tried everything I could (that was n't dangerous). Do n't overdose on it either! I wonder if it has a chance of working on others. If anybody else tries this, please leave a response. Then maybe give me an update a month or two. Good luck######I 'd like to buy potassium with ascorbic acid.

I was diagnosed with ITP at the age of 16. I had taken Prednisone, done different blood fusion treatments, and was even at the risk of having my spleen removed until I found Transfer Factor.

My platelet count never zoomed but stayed in the 120,000 range, but in 1998 I got a DVT clot in my calf and was put on Coumadin blood thinner. It did n't affect my platelet account and the hemotologist decided to leave me on the blood thinner until I lost weight (which I did n't). In 2005 I had my gallbladder removed and that hemotologist took me off Coumadin. 18 months later my ITP returned and counts got as low as 2,000. The docs put me on high doses of Prednisone, Imuran, and CellCept. Nothing worked to give me stable platelet counts but in March 2007 I had a blood clot in my lungs (PE) and was put on coumadin again. The docs were concerned because of my low platelet counts but were surprised that my counts started to move up and are now in the 120,000 range again. They removed me from Prednisone (weaned) and CellCept but left me on Imuran and the counts were stable at that level. I have a major problem with abdominal swelling and feel it 's the Imuran, but now the doc is worried abut taking me down on it as he does n't want to risk my platelet count going down. But my clothes do n't fit and I feel very unattractive- wo n't even go to a pool anymore because of the swelling. We 'll have to see but for what it 's worth, for me at least, going on Coumadin seems to have helped my ITP platelet count situation... as I think I had clumping platelets and never got a proper result until my blood was made thin.######Hi, I have ITP and was put on Prednisone, but had a huge allergic reaction to it. Now I 'm taking Dexamethasone which is keeping platelets over 50K. When the platelets drop below 10K I get huge bruises and red legs, however, if I cut myself I do n't bleed too much & my blood seems to clot okay. Obviously I 'm very confused !! I read about Transfer Factor & have ordered that. Does anyone know what dosage one should be taking & do you take the Transfer Factor as well as the steroids & slowly phase out the steroids? Help. I was also interested in the comment about clumping platelets and coumadin which would make sense for clumping platelets. If anyone can help I 'd really appreciate it.

I take 2 Transfer Factor pills a day which is what you will see recommended on the bottle. When I started taking it, I was on Prednisone, and what I did was take both at once (mainly because I was very freaked out that it would n't work and my platelets would plummet), and once Transfer Factor Plus had my platelets back to normal (more than 150,000) I phased out the steroids.

Today I go in for Rituxan. . so hopefully this will work. I started new vitamin therapy a week ago, based on this article: 2 oz fresh wheatgrass, 1500 mg vit c, 198 mg potassium, iron (prescribed by my hema) and diet rich in vitamin k foods (kale, salads, etc). When I went in for CBC count i thought great, I did n't bruise that much when they took the CBC. I thought my platelets were way (still on Pred but weaning today). Sadly my count was only 2k. I am optimistic though, because last two x's I had to be hospitalized due to blood blisters in my mouth, my hema was schocked showed no signs except light brusing on legs. I think the vitamins and healthy diet has helped the outward signs of bleeding and bruising, my platelets are just very low. Hopefully the Ritux will help stimulate the platelets but I will definitely stick w/ my vitamins!

Most diagnosed with ITP (between 80- 90%) have acute ITP. These children usually recover within a few months whether they receive treatment or not. Recovery is possible even if your child is considered to have chronic ITP. Doctors don t know what causes ITP, but it often occurs in otherwise healthy children a few days or weeks after a viral infection. There is also some evidence that certain vaccines may trigger ITP, but this occurs inonly a small percentage of cases. Why ITP happens in some children and not others who have had the same infection, virus or vaccine is not known. The danger of bleeding is primarily related to your child s platelet count. For example, a platelet count of less than 50,000 may cause your child to bleed or bruise easily. A platelet count lower than 10,000 will increase the risk of serious bleeding. However, life-threatening bleeding, such as bleeding in the brain is rare, and occurs in less than 1 percent of children with ITP. It s important that if your child s platelet count is very low he should not be given aspirin or any medicine containing aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). Nor should your child be given anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen or naproxen, or any medicine containing glycerol guaiacolate (Robitussin), as these medicines can prevent the few platelets your child has from working properly. Be sure to check with your doctor before giving your child any medicine other than acetaminophen (Tylenol). Because ITP in children often resolves on its own, no treatment may be recommend other than a weekly or biweekly blood test to monitor the platelet level. As soon as the platelet count increases, the interval between blood tests may be lengthened; but your child will still be monitored until the platelet level returns to normal and is stable. If treatment is recommended, Prednisone, IVIg, or WinRho may be used to keep the platelet count within a safe range until your child s body recovers: I know how awful it is to have a child sick from any cause. Stay strong. I hope the little guy will be fine soon!######Thanks for the information! I am so nervous about this even so I know it is usually not extremely serious. I just keep checking my son every day to look for any bruising and I get nervous before each blood draw. I had never even heard of ITP before so this whole thing has been a real shock..######-Heart-Vascular###-Blood and Blood Vessel

We were sent to a Children's Hospital with a platelet count of 6,000... she was given Winrho and got to go home when her platelets reached 15,000. We were given a written order to have her labs checked once a week. The first week her platelets soared up to 120,000 and yesterday they were up to 290,000. I assumed that the med. had worked and her ITP was gone. I called the hospital today to see if we needed to continue to have her levels checked and they said we needed to keep having them done once a week until her appt. with the Hematologist next month. Is it very likely that her platelets will drop again now that they 're up to 290,000? They also wanted us to keep her out of gymnastics until then. The nurse was in a hurry, so I did n't get a chance to ask more questions. Why would she need to stay out of gymnastics when her platelet counts are now well within normal range? Since her platelets are now so high... would n't it take awhile if they were to drop back down to dangerous levels? Thanks in advance, Hilery######Not if she has chronic ITP. My counts have dropped from 215 to 30 in a week before. Only time will tell at this point, 2 weeks is too soon. The good news is that most childhood ITP cases are acute.######Thanks for your reply. All of her bruises had just cleared up... and then today she woke up with petechiae on her neck again. There are only a few of them, but the last time her platelets dropped this was the first symptom she had. I 'm hoping that is n't the case this time.######I 'm funny with petechiae. I 've only gotten them a few times, at both high and low counts. For me, bruises are a more accurate way to judge where I 'm at. Are you taking her for a CBC anytime soon?######Yes, she 'll have labs done again on Wednesday. I guess I 'll just keep an eye on her until then.######My son was diagnosed with itp in Feb of 2004... we went in for treatment which was IVIG... and he responded really really well. His platelets went up in the 200's. Then... three weeks later almost to the day they dropped right back down to 4 !!! It was shocking. The docs sometimes dont tell you that this can happen. I guess they dont want us to worry. Any way, he went back in for another treatment... and again his platelete levels went up in the 200's. He has been there ever since. We are now over ITP... and we are blessed that it was a short journey. Some kids will get out of ITP sooner then others. 80% of kids will be over it within the first 6 months. Some go to be chronic. In all likely hood your child will probably be over it soon. If you have any other questions feel free to ask. I know how hard it is. I wish you the best !!!######coley, Thank you for sharing your son's story. I 'm glad to hear he 's doing better now and is over ITP. My daughter's counts are still dropping. She developed a blood blister in her mouth over the weekend, so we had a CBC done again yesterday. They were down to 85,000 (they were at 113,000 last Wed.). We 'll go back to the Hematologist next Monday. Hopefully, her counts wo n't continue to drop..######-Heart-Vascular###-Blood and Blood Vessel

First, the diagnosis of asthma must be confirmed, and confounding or exacerbating factors like ongoing allergen presence or additional lung diseases must be evaluated and treated. There are number of conditions that can mimic or coexist with asthma. One of these condition is the allergic rhinitis. Exposure to allergens in sensitized children or cigarette smoke can cause ongoing poorly controlled symptoms and steps to reduce exposure will help to improve control. A combination of intranasal steroid and anti- histamine may reduced asthma exacerbations (attacks of worsened asthma), and Leukotriene receptor antagonists are effective in treating both, asthma and rhinitis. There is a clinical data about beneficial effect of subcutaneous immunotherapy in children with allergy and asthma. Young patients with rhinitis receiving SIT are less likely to develop subsequent asthma or new allergic sensitivities. Talk with a pulmologist- allergist!.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Asthma

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly used in the treatment of chronic persistent childhood asthma. Prior research has demonstrated that unnecessarily large doses of ICS can cause harm in a number of ways including growth retardation and adrenal suppression in children. Additional previous research using long acting beta agonists, showed to be steroid-sparing, but came with their own risks. However, few studies have looked at nutritional supplements in this regard. This study was designed to explore the hypothesis that the patented omega-3 marine lipid extract of the New Zealand green-lipped mussel, known as â$ PCSO-524â$, might reduce the need for inhaled corticosteroids in pediatric patients with moderate asthma. Researchers noted an ability of the study protocol to safely reduce ICS doses by a mean of approximately 25% using clinical and respiratory function monitoring, including end-tidal nitric oxide monitoring. These findings are consistent with a previous study that followed 110 asthmatic adults and children for a year demonstrating the ability to safely wean patients off ICS. While the study demonstrated a significant reduction in the daily need to use ICS inhalers, the researchers cautioned that the use of the green-lipped mussel extract should be used in conjunction with the prescribed medication, not in place of it. These results build on the prior research on the patented oil extract of the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (PCSO-524) in asthma showing that it is a safe nutritional supplement for children with moderate asthma. This study demonstrates a potential trend to inhaled corticosteroid sparing with an improvement shown in quality of life as assessed by the Juniper pediatric asthma inventory.

Prior to the bypass they were watching his renal function, but he was doing all the right things. The surgery sent him into acute renal failure. He 's had dialysis every day this past week. Found out yesterday the nutritionist ``did n't know he was diabetic '' and was giving him meals with sugar. (He 's been insuline dependent for 15 years!) This morning the nurse said his creatinine (sp?) level went up overnight. Still do n't have actual number. They are still saying his kidneys might ``kick in '' and start working well enough that he wo n't have to stay on dialysis beyond the next 3 months.

I 'm a Health Boards member (I have MS) and I know that real people with real stories can sometimes give me the truth that doctors will dance around. I thank you for ANY information !!!######If the docs say that he has a chance of being able to go off dialysis, then he does have a chance. This is not something they will say to someone with diabetes and renal problems. Unless it is true. Whether he is able to get off dialysis will depend mostly on how severe his damage was before the bypass and how hard a hit his kidneys took because of the procedure. This is not something easily quantified and unfortunately he will just have to wait and see. But, as I said, the good news is that there is a distinct possiblity that he will get off dialysis. Hope this helps. Cora######I have taken care of patients who did regain full function of their kidneys after going into acute kidney failure.######Thank you both so much, we needed to know there was a chance at least!

My brother has just been diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, and as I 'm new to all this I was looking for a little help on his prognosis. Basically he was initially diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, but they found that some of his pancreas had ``died '' so this diagnosis was changed to chronic pancreatitis. He has therefore stopped drinkng completely (the cause was alcohol). He is 28 years old. He suffered bouts of pain after drinking previously, but now has no pain and has not had any for months (ie is not constantly or regularly in pain). Based on this latesgt info can someone give me a rognosis of his case? I know it differs from person to person, but it is hard to find out really where he stands from reading the web only, most of which is retty scary to read. Any help is appreciated. Jack######My wife had a similar problem. Talk to your GI Doc about how much damage has been done. She quit drinking as well and had no problems, then had a glass of wine New Years and major attack. Also fatty foods and high fiber uncooked vegetables will cause problems we have found as. So diet and abstinence from alcohol have seemed to be her keys. From what I have read, there is an increased chance of diabetes as well as an increased chance of pancreatic cancer with each episode. So, it is best to get a good GI doc and take his/her advice seriously..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

Circulation in the legs, kidneys, heart, lungs, eyes and brain. Too much glucose in the blood stream causes irritation to all the arteries and veins in your body. This results is total kidney failure, heart problems, vision problems-- the list goes on and on. The best way that I know to help is to become very proactive and educated yourself about diabetes-- go on a diet like those that are described in books like the Zone or Protein Power books. And, Eat your way to Health-- I know It 's not easy but people do it !! God Bless ~ ~ ~ Harry######Thank you for the response. It has been a long journey and hopefully I will have a long journey ahead of me too. Just tired at this point with so much on my plate to deal with. But I 'll get thru it somehow. Thanks again for listening. Allan######I think I have responded to one of your previous posts regarding pancreatitis. The pancreas is a horrible little organ! I never realized just how many problems it can cause until I developed severe acute pancreatitis when I was 34 weeks pregnant with my daughter due to high triglycerides. They had to take my daughter by emergency C-Section, and put me in ICU and gave me a 5-10% chance of making it through the night. My kidneys failed that night, I went in to respiratory distress, and my heart was pausing. It was a miracle that things changed for the better in the next few days. That attack left me with numerous psuedocysts. (the CT scan report said there were too many to count) The docs said they were just going to watch the psuedocysts, but then I began having more pain, and a lot of nausea/vomiting b/c the cysts were getting bigger. They drained the biggest cysts by visualizing them on ultrasound and sucking out the fluid with a needle. It was n't as unpleasant as it sounds though. My cysts kept refilling, so they had to surgically remove them. I now have chronic pancreatitis b/c there was so much damage to my pancreas. I have to take digestive enzymes, since my pancreas is not producing any. It causes a lot of pain/nausea but with a good doc like mine, they keep it under control with medication. Hopefully you wo n't have as many problems as i have with the pancreas/psuedocysts, as I 've been told a case as severe as mine was is pretty rare. I 'll keep you in my thoughts! and keep us posted as to how you are doing!.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

In terms of heart attacks: generally when one thinks about the type of people who is at greatest risk for a heart attack, invariably, one pictures a fat man who eats fatty food, smokes cigarettes and sits around the house all day doing no exercise. To a certain extent this is true. FOUR of the five major risk factors for heart attacks are reversible and they are: 1) Cigarette smoking 2) High cholesterol 3) High blood pressure 4) Diabetes Things like obesity, sedentery life style etc. etc. are not major risk factors. They can CONTRIBUTE to one's overall heart attack risk, but they are n't as important as the ones above. What those four risk factors have in common is that they all significantly play a part in making the caliber of your coronary arteries (the arteries which get blocked when you have a heart attack) smaller. 1. Smoking results in inflammation which can lead to plaque deposition in the artery walls which lessens the caliber. 2. High cholesterol leads to the deposition of plaque in the coronary wall decreasing the caliber. 3. High blood pressure results in thickening of the walls of the arteries (including the coronary arteries thereby reducing the caliber) 4. Diabetes results in the injury of the insides of the vessels (including the coronary vessels) which results in laying down of inflammatory cells which leads to plaque formation which leads to the reduction of the vessel's caliber. Are you sensing a theme here? Anyway, the smaller the caliber of the arteries are, the more likely they 'll get blocked. Additionally, if you have a rough plaque in one of the arteries, it can rupture, clot off and cause an acute heart attack. So it 's possible that you have some of those risk factors and that is why you were prone to a heart. However, if you do NOT have any of those risk factors, the last risk factor is one you can NOT reverse: 5) A family history of premature coronary artery disease. Are there any men in your family who had a heart attack before the age of 50 or a woman before the age of 55? If so, it 's possible that your family just has the tendency to either have smaller caliber heart vessels, or more of a tendency to deposit plaque in these vessels or a combination of both. Unfortunately, you ca n't control your genes, so if you have risk factor# 5, about all you can to is try to lessen the further amount of plaque in your arteries by taking your medications and by NOT developing any of the risk factors from 1-4.######hey thanks that did help!######I ``m sorry to hear about your Heart Attack. Follow the certain guidlines in maintaining good health. I 'm glad to hear that you quit smoking. Make sure you make an appointment with a cardiologist and have routine check-ups from now on. Stay heart happy.######I `am sorry to hear that as well. I, too just found out through an ekg that I also had a heart attack. Obviously it was the silent type, I guess. I just turned 43 and he thinks it 's ``older. '' What a mind blower that was. I too smoke. Less than half a pack a day. I 'm allowing myself 5 a day and then down from there. I just wanted to let you know that I empathize with you and I hope you are doing okay.######I had a severe heart attack at the age of 47. That was in the 1970 time frame, I smoked like a chimney (2 packs/day), was traveling internationally and was under a lot of stress. Had to have bypass surgery. I quit smoking, started strenuous exercising, taking cholesterol reducing statins and have now reached the ripe old age of 82. Lots of enjoyable life after a heart attack if you take reasonable care. Bill######I was 37 when i had my heart attack and had my stent placed in my lad I too still have pains in my chest and have had angigrans done and there are no blockages the doc says the pains are normal as there is no way to get rid of all the pains i probable have a small pain a day but no biggie i just keep my nitro close by incase the pain get severe######When the cardiologists do stenting, they are widening the large vessels; unfortunately, in people who have coronary artery disease, they can also have narrowing of the microvasculature which is NOT amenable to angioplasty. It 's for this reason, many people still have some degree of chest pain, but no resulting heart attacks after angioplasty.######But do n't obesity, lack of exercise, and unhealthy diet cause or increase the problem with high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poor blood sugar control in type II diabetes? Some people substantially improve their blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar control by losing excess body fat, adding exercise, and cleaning up their diet.######Hi Tj, Yes absolutely obesity can cause that; however, there are many people who are obese (or at least overweight) who surprisingly do n't have any trouble with diabetes or high blood pressure (though they have other health problems). What 's more important though, there is a HUGE HUGE chunk of people who are NOT overweight or obese, but do have the above risk factors. In other words, those risk factors are independent of obesity, and are more important to cardiovascular outcomes. Arguably, the most important risk factor is family history. There are just certain people who are more prone to forming plaque in their coronary arteries and having these plaques rupture, and this is not even related to smoking, diabetes, cholesterol and high blood pressure.######to all that answered my questions thank you so much boy it has really helped !!!!######Hi Bill, Your story fills me with some hope. I am 36 and just had a heart attack. Non-smoker, no drugs or alcohol, great blood pressure and lipid levels, terrible genes. I hope to do as well as you have done- I am working hard to change what I can, and on medication- the attack was in a small branch and they could n't fix it with angioplasty or a stent. Anyways- thanks for the message. It helps!######Hi Kim Have u sought help for quitting smoking. I am also unable to quit completely and do smoke 4-5 a day.######hi sorry to hear about your heart attack i had my 4 heart attack my last one was 3 weeks ago i was 27 when i had my 1st then 2007 had stents 2008 stents then feb 2009 which had stents my weight is good my chol is very good bp good no family history no anwsers to why the thing is not to worry about the pain that is normal you have to stay of the cigs the heart will cause you more pain i used to smoke also stress of what has happened remember you are still hear and live life to the full.######-Heart-Vascular###-Heart Disorders

I had alot of complications along the way even though this was my first attack. My gallbladder was fine however, my attack was caused by high blood sugars (I 'm type 2 diabetic), and triglycerides (trigs). My liphase levels were over 4,000 and trigs over 3,000. I almost did not make it. I have much better control of my sugars now and take medicine for trigs. I 've lost 40 lbs and avoid foods high in fat and sugar, eat things low in carbs and alot of protein... your basic diabetic diet. I go into panic attack every time I have a stomach ache and/or nausea as I 'm afraid I will have another attack.

I am currently taking 1tblsp in 8oz water with 1tsp honey. It does suppress my appetite and aids digestion. I 've lost 5lbs so far, you still need to eat well and exercise, but it does help a lot. Here 's some further info for ya: A bottle of this remarkable liquid probably sits in your pantry, used occasionally when a recipe calls for it. But this inexpensive, unglamorous condiment is a source of some powerful health remedies. Vinegar contains many important vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids: calcium, potassium, beta-carotene, magnesium and iron, to name a few. Due to recent research results, doctors and scientists are now calling it a ``functional '' food- a food that not only is nutritious but also can help prevent and protect against disease. Here are a few benefits of different types of vinegar: Apple Cider Vinegar: Encourages cell and tissue growth; helps transmit nerve impulses and enriches blood; helps the stomach to produce hydrochloric acid, which aids digestion and helps prevent digestive disorders as we age. Red Wine Vinegar: Flavonoid-rich, it can help lower cholesterol levels, lessening the risk of heart attack, stroke and high blood pressure. Balsamic Vinegar: This vinegar is high in anti-oxidants and potassium. And here are some therapeutic uses for vinegar: Apply apple cider vinegar to burns to alleviate inflammation, swelling and prevent blisters. Clear congestion by inhaling the vapor from a steaming pot of water with several spoonfuls of apple cider vinegar. Soothe a sore throat by gargling a 50-50 solution of warm water and vinegar. Stop hiccups by sipping a glass of warm water mixed with a teaspoon of vinegar. Alleviate athlete's foot by rinsing feet several times a day with plain or apple cider vinegar. The acid of the vinegar helps top fungus growth and relieves itching. Fight off menopausal night sweats by sponging yourself down with apple cider vinegar before going to bed. And do n't forget to use it mixed with oil to dress a salad, or mixed with oil as a dip for bread instead of that pat of butter!

I started taking apple cider vinegar on Monday and went to the doctor on Tuesday and my blood pressure went down 128/86. I 'm not sure if this worked that fast or the machine in the grocery store was wrong. Does anyone have any idea if using apple cider vinegar works on lower your blood pressure?######YES! Check out my other posts. In a nutshell, my dad SWEARS by garlic & Apple cider. He adds these 2 into almost all of his foods. He actually drinks a teaspoonful of apple cider every morning. He 's been weaned off comletely of one of his meds, and his other bp med has been reduced to 25 mg once a day. Not bad at all! He also has a treadmill & a medical device called the resperate to help lower his blood pressure. ANYTHING to avoid pills !!! Veronicca######I take apple cider vinegar capsules (1500 mg.) I started taking teaspons a day for my hands that were cracking and bleeding. After starting on ACV, the problem went away. My daughter bought me some capsules. They seem to work as well. I had an episode of high blood pressure at work. I was allergic to the Lisenoprill, so I tried increasing my ACV capsules and my blood pressure is much better.######My grandmother told me about that old home remedy of Apple Cider Vinger to lower blood pressure. Make sure your not buying the one that 's used for cooking, because that 's very harsh on the stomach. Health food stores and places like GNC have the drinking kind, that called apple cider vinegar mother's core. And they also have the herbal pills. Try drinking it daily with lots of water, and try to get that bottom number down some more.######The explanation is farely simple. Apple pectin is a natural circulatory health boost. It helps your body clean its own veins and arteries out. Vinegar is a natural metabolism boost, its very acidic, so your body speeds up the metabolic process to get the vinegar out of the stomach (thats how all metabolic medicines work). You could get the same result from eating a couple apples with a chili pepper too. Or apple with Guarana extract. Vinegar is just very soft on the stomach. The higher metabolism gets the apple pectin moving quick through your body because of increased blood flow, therefore delivering more pectin to more areas before it has time to decay. This same method also helps in weight loss, because as your metabolic rate speeds up your body needs sufficient energy to boost itself, using carbohydrate reserves (fat) to fuel the fire. In the process reducing the amount of reserve needing to be maintained, which reduces strain on the heart. In other words, Apple cider vinegar is probably the best method for health and circulatory control. An apple a day keeps a heart attack away. I suggest getting the tablet extract form. I get mine at wal-mart, target, any health food store anywhere. Its listed as a weight loss diet, but do n't think its anything like ephedrine. Far different. Its a lot easier to carry around and take, plus I always found it pretty hard to swallow down any type of vinegar. Mind you eating a real apple and drinking real vinegar is the method with the best results. The tablet form works for me. Anyway. Hope I was of some help.######ACV is n't bad if you use a sweetener like Stevia. I have tried several flavors of it, and am currently using the Lemon drop flavor. Very nice and lemony. I buy mine from amazon grocery. I take between 2teaspoons-1 tablespoon a few times a day. With the stevia (between 4-8 drops) and 8 ounces of water. I notice when I do n't take it, that my joint pain comes back, so it also works as an anti-inflammatory. Buy the Braggs brand or any other that show ``Raw organic apple cider vinegar. '' You can buy it at most health food stores, Whole Foods, Wild Oats, even in some supermarkets `health food ' section. Important note: If you take the ACV, do not take that aspirin a day. The ACV helps thin the blood, the way the aspirin does, so you do n't need both. And long term use of the aspirin a day makes the stomach bleed, and that 's never good.######If ACV is effective treatment for high blood presure, why my doctor never advise me to do so. I have been using my doctor medication for almost 20 years and the result is the same.My blood presure goes ups and down.######Because Apple Cider Vinegar is a CURE. Doc and big pharmacy would n't make money off of cured people. If doctor prescribed medicine actually worked why would anyone need to be on a medicine for a lifetime. You should be able to pop a couple of pills and be done with you DISease. Look into natural cures for everything. Your body was mad eto heal itself.######This post is being reviewed to be sure that it adheres to our Community Guidelines. Thanks for your patience!######I too am sick of Doctors who are only out to help the Pharmaceutical companies. My Doctor will only prescribe the most expensive drugs on the market too. and when I ask him why I ca n't have a cheaper drug he tells me '' Oh you ca n't take that '' So I am looking to find ways to manage my own BP and Diabetes, without medication (I do n't take meds for the diabetes yet. But I would like to know if, tasking Apple cider vinegar just before I take the Blood pressure medication will interact with the BP Medication.######apple cider Vinegar will also help you to control your sugar. Try Cinnamon Capsules for Boold Glucose.######also bitter squash, funegreek seed, aloe vera, and dandelion also use for control the blood sugar level. Special Chinese are using bitter squash for diabetes from long long times in their herb.######I take ACV every morning and once sometime during the day before 9pm trying to control my BP and CL. I have family members that never took meds and they are 80 now because they took ACV back in Ardmore Oklahoma. I know it works. But if you are on meds you do want the best meds because a lot of the cheap ones have lots of side effects. So if your doctor suggest one that is expensive he cares about you or you really may not be able to take certain ones based on the change in your kidney function from blood test results. I can not take any meds with HCT in it. It causes imediate change to my kidney function. Doctors make money on giving you meds because they have to have you in their office at least every 4 months to check the meds in your blood. It does not matter what type of meds just meds in general. Especially CL meds. mix a tall liter bottle of water with 1/4 cup of acv and add honey to taste and put it in the frige. Take two big swallows of it before two meals daily and walk at least 3 times a week for 30 minutes or on tread mill 15 minutes at the highest incline 3 times a week and you will see a difference in weight, BP and CL. Adding garlic to that same bottle will help joints and BP also. IF your BP and Joints are bad with RH. Ceylon Cinnamin will also lower glucose and lover CL but it must be the Ceylon kind. Any other will call problems to your liver.######I take ACV every morning and once sometime during the day before 9pm trying to control my BP and CL.

ACV prevent convertion of carbohydrate into sugar by destroying digestive enzymes like lipase, amylase etc.. I put 1 tsp of ACV into a eight oz glass of water and take it before meal. My sugar level went down from 170 to 117. Try it. But, if you eat sugar and already sweetened food, it may not work, as it only prevents conversion of carbohydrate. It is working for my fine.######Have you checked out cold pressed virgin cocount oil? There is some data that suggests using coconut oil in your diet will help you get your blood sugar regulated. I am currently using raw organic ACV and cold pressed virgin coconut oil for the purpose of regulating my blood sugar and blood pressure as well as the hopes of lowering my cholesterol. I 'm not saying it will work, I 'm too new to this to say one way or the other right now, but do some research on both. Information is power.######Have you checked out cold pressed virgin cocount oil? There is some data that suggests using coconut oil in your diet will help you get your blood sugar regulated.

You have 20 years documented history. Try for one month using acv and see if it makes a difference. If yes you have proof. Hope you get to stop the pills soon.######Why would you continue doing the same thing for 20 years in order to continue experiencing the same results? Obviously, you do not have high BP because your body is in short supply of BP medicine. While ultra high BP may warrant a short term course of BP meds in an emergency, the ultimate goals should be to correct the problem naturally and get off all meds. Has it never occurred to you that the medical establishment does not want you to stop taking BP meds and actually cure your high BP through diet and exercise? If all patients ate right and exercised, supplemented with quality whole food products, they would lose billions of dollars annually.######well my blood pressure was 149 over 97 and I began taking apple cider vinegar two teaspoons in the morning with water and two in the evening with water...

If so which one?######Apple cider vinegar really works for hypertension. I am not on any medication, therefore my doctor asked me to use diet to reduce my hypertension.I started using apple cider vinegar, 2tablespoon to a pint of water for three days.On 14/4/09 my blood pressure went from 136/97 to 167/89. I know that the top reading is a high but the bottom is remarkable. Today 30/4/09, the nurse congratulate me, it is now 140/80.

Again, thank you.######Why the heck dont you have any health insurance ??? All of our congressmen, senators and president does, and you paid for it. Oh and they just gave themselves the largest raise ever granted. I guess to celebrate the horrid state of the union.######A fair question by the OP but unrealistic to see a systolic change of 20 mm as meaningful during a busy day. Mine can vary by at least 30mm- BP needs to be done at the same time and conditions every day for some time to gauge effects. On the ACV thing I tried a `clear ' one from Health Food Store that said it could be taken as a tonic- I took a tsp in a smoothy and that was ok but when taken in apple juice, with all the fibre in, was far too sharp and made my throat rather raw. Did n't feel right- was this just starting pains ??######wow !!!! i have a large jug of apple cider vingar because i read about the great things it does, its suppose to help you loose weight also. now i m going to ignore the taste and start taking it again.######Hi trv, I do n't think you actually used pure apple cider vinegar (with the Mother) which is dark and should be diluted one tablespoon in a pint of water. This can even be a little rough on the throat if not properly diluted. I suspect that you might have used ordinary vinegar which can be extremely rough on the throat. Try Braggs Pure apple cider vinegar.######Yeah Samdy- I do n't think this `mutha ' had the `mother ' though the shop where I got it is very good usually. But for the tonic thing on the label I would n't have bought it. Substituting it back by using with pressed apple did n't do the trick. I will try H+B for the real thing, or maybe order online in the end- and look out for Braggs if available in UK.######I started taking acv a week ago. One teaspoon in a small glass of water. I 've found that drinking it through a straw, thereby bypassing the teeth and most of the tongue makes it easy. So far I have definately noticed a marked reduction in appetite, especially for sweet things incuding alcohol. Will wait another week before I weigh myself but am confident of weight loss. Also, I have just checked my pulse rate. It was 58, as opposed to 68 two weeks ago.I feel this is beneficial as far as blood pressure is concerned.######Some of you wanting to lower your blood pressure using raw organic apple cider vinegar (ACV) such as Braggs brand, or Spectrum have to realize that you must make other changes as well. Like cutting down on salt which is# 1. Plus watching what you eat and cutting out the high saturated fatty foods, and exercising daily even if it 's just walking a half hour after a meal in the evening. You will see great results if you implement all of the above, plus reduce your stress levels. I also take a Hawthorne supplement a few times a day. It helps with circulation problems. Plus now and then some Dandelion extract. That tastes great mixed in some water. The ACV is best with a little sweetener such as liquid stevia or honey or agave nectar. Whichever you prefer. Helps it all go down smoothly and tastier.######Back in 1974 I was very sick with a strep throat, which created complications with Kidneys. I lear n't the only effective prevention of Streptococci Bacilus is to include Apple Cider Vinegar every day in your diet. This was discovered effective in the prevention of Strep in Cows milk, back in the early 1900's, following ACV in cows diets, in Vermont, USA.######I 've heard good things about apple cider vinegar and use it myself as a part of a salad dressing. The point I want to make is the actual blood pressure readings. The drops recorded in these posts is not very spectacular and does not necessarily indicate success with this or that cure. Blood pressure readings are never very accurate and can only show a range. A BP monitor can change have a variation of as much as 10 points up or down even though the person's actual blood pressure has changed a bit. Of course if you consistently read over 145 systolic or over 105 diastolic then it 's time to pay attention and act.######Aliante did you know our bodliy fluids (blood & amnionics) are as salty as the ocean, in actual fact if we do n't have these natural salts in our system we run the risk of having strokes & causing brain damage. My reason for bringing this to your attension is this; most supermarket salt is extracted of all other minerals & treated at high heat temps which changes any minerals left to a different molecular structure in which we ca n't absorb cellularly so instead our body stores away anything it cant eliminate as fat. This is one reason where salt causes bp to rise among other things, the other reason is our body ca n't eliminate the salts if there is not enough fluids to pass through the cellular level so in fact salt will act as a cleanser & be eliminated from the body when we hydrate correctly with clean quality water. I have lost 49 lb of weight using salt & a alkalizing diet where i consumed high levels of calories of the correct nature & correct hydration & no exercise, my BP fell from 150/80 to currently 118/62 there is an exact proceedure for this & attempting this without propper guidance is not advised. Go study my posts & you will find more on this & other subjects that are here only to help people research there own nutrition######I do know the difference with supermarket salt and natural ones. I do use some salt on my food, but I buy the natural rock salt from France and grind it myself. Too much salt is bad for Blood Pressure, most anyone knows this. Since my first post in 2007, I have evolved to better things in my weight loss efforts and in lowering my blood pressure. I eat a whole food plant based diet. I still take the ACV once in awhile but I now take hawthorne berry supplements exclusively and I walk for at least 1 hour every evening. The walking alone will lower your blood pressure. The hawthorne keeps the circulation going. I have found now that i have to lower my hawthorne berries down to 1 supplement 3 times a day. Before it was 2 supplements 3 times a day. Since the weight has been dropping off, in the first month i lost 5 lbs a week, now I just lose 2 pounds a week. So no thanks, I will pass on the salt regimen. I found something that works much better for me and it 's easy, just lace up the walking shoes, grab a bottle of water, go outside, put one foot in front of the other, walk as fast as I comfortably can and walk as far as I can. Repeat daily.######Grocery store pharmacy automated blood pressure cuffs are supplied by pharmacuetical companies. They started showing up when the market was flooded with effective blood pressure medicines. I 've never found one that does n't read my BP about 10-20 points higher than a doctors office visit. You should allways have BP tested by a trained professional using calibrated equipment.######Aliante, YOUR MISSING THE POINT it 's not the salt causing high bp it 's the lack of water, my bp dropped & natural salt is alkalizing which is a protection factor against cancer. Too much exercise can cause weight gain if we do n't hydrate correctly.######How do you figure too much excercise can cause weight gain if we do n't hydrate correctly? Are you talking about water gain after dehydration?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-High Blood Pressure and Hypertension

Apple Cider Vinegar, that wonderful old-timers home remedy, cures more ailments than any other folk remedy-- we 're convinced! From the extensive reader feedback we 've received over the past 6 years, the reported cures from drinking Apple Cider Vinegar are numerous: allergies (including pet, food and environmental), sinus infections, acne, high cholesterol, flu, chronic fatigue, candida, acid reflux, sore throats, contact dermatitis, arthritis, and gout. One reader reported that a shot of ACV saved him from going to the emergency room for heart pain. Apple Cider Vinegar also breaks down fat and is widely used to lose weight. It has also been reported that a daily dose of apple cider vinegar in water has soaring blood pressure under control in two weeks! If you can get over the taste of apple cider vinegar, you will find it one of the most important natural remedies in healing the body. Apple Cider Vinegar is also wonderful for dogs, cats, and horses. It helps them with arthritic conditions, controls fleas & barn flies, and gives a beautiful shine to their coats! As a wonderful side effect of drinking apple cider vinegar every day, we discovered that it brings a healthy, rosy glow to one's complexion! This is great news if you suffer from a pale countenance.######Ive only been using it a couple of days now, but my skin has seriously improved. I know its probably to early but hopefully it continues. On another acne site a lot of people have reported results within a few days. Im using an organic apple cider vinegar has people have reported better results using hte organic type. The only difficult part is the taste but it doesnt bother me to much.######I have never drank it for acne purpose but have used it externally on the face to fade post acne red spots. It worked very well. You can try using it on your face also, just dilulte it with water in a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 (one part of apple cider vinegar to 2 parts or 3 parts of water).######Are you supposed to drink the vinegar straight out of the bottle or can you mix it with something to lessen the taste? The smell alone makes me cringe!######I had a couple of tablespoons to a glass of water and down it. I use Aspall Organic cider vinegar which is sold in most supermarkets in uk, dont know about anywhere else. Apparently it needs to be organic to see the best results. Its still very early days for me but my skin is looking a lot better even after only a few days of using.######Yeah, it tastes pretty sour, yikes. I mix it in with a lemon ice-tea drink mix, that makes it easier to down it. I 'm starting to get used to the taste anyway. I only started a couple of days ago, we 'll see...######Here 's a quick suggestion to help the taste. I have been using Body Ami, blended with juice and honey. Works great and tastes much better..######-Skin & Beauty###-Acne

Is that correct? And some have even said that they use a lot of it for that reason, and perhaps for weightloss. Here 's what I wonder: I use vinegar as a weed killer. I fill up a spray bottle with vinegar and give a light spray to weeds in places where they are difficult to pull. By the next day, most weeds are usually dead. My question: If vinegar can kill plant cells, is it safe to eat? What does it do to the cells of our stomach lining? If it was sold in your local garden department as a ``weed killer '', would you spray it on your salad too? I stopped using vinegar several months ago because I ca n't see putting acid in my stomach, even though it 's supposed to be a safe amount. At best I think it 's just another processed ``food ''.######Carbonated beverages and orange juice have lower pH values than vinegar and stomach acid is lower than any of them. A small amount of vinegar is n't going to make any difference to the acidity of your stomach.######We have bacteria in our stomachs that help with digestion. What does it take to kill off that bacteria? Our own stomach acid is n't supposed to kill that bacteria but I wonder if vinegar will. I wonder if that is the reason why it keeps our blood sugar from spiking. Vinegar is supposed to slow down digestion and thereby keep our blood sugar from spiking. Is digestion slowed down because some of the helpful bacteria is killed off? It probably seems like a silly question but what am I to think if I do n't know how or why vinegar slows down digestion.######We do n't have bacteria in our stomachs to digest food. The bacteria are in the large intestine. Food does n't even stay in the stomach for very long. Most digestion and absorption occurs in the small intestine.######JohnR41- in regards vinegar- you need to be using Raw Apple Cider Vinegar- that has not been distilled- it needs to be fermented to release the healing enzymes and life giving nutrients. It needs to have the `mother ' in it- or you are getting the distilled kind, which is not beneficial for human needs. Many people mistakenly purchase the cheapest vinegar they find- ca n't tolerate the taste or the smell and give up on the benefits saught of vinegar. Bragg's is a very good brand to use, they have written several booklets on the uses of raw apple cider vinegar and if you ever get a really good taste of this stuff, you will be able to tell the difference. I have used white distilled vinegar for years, for household cleaning and in my laundry- wash. I always buy the largest cheapest one I can find for those uses. Raw Apple Cider Vinegar is a bit more expensive, yet you do not have to use much. Used in homemade salad dressings- it is fantastic! I would n't waste this as a herbicide in the yard- although there have been numerous uses associated with this in regards to garden pests- and not the insect kind. Some things Raw Apple Cider Vinegar helps with are: helps to prevent brittle teeth, hair loss and runny noses. helps to regulate blood pressure and reduce bad cholesterol. gives ACV the properties of being anti-viral, anti-bacterial & anti-fungal. helps create strong bones and teeth. gives ACV its alkaline property which aids your body in maintaining proper pH levels for a healthy alkaline state. It appears that this acid slows the digestion of starch which can help to lower the rise in glucose that commonly occurs after meals. More of the things Raw Apple Cider Vinegar may assist with are: May help with joint pain and stiffness Been used for centuries as a natural remedy for heartburn Improves bowel irregularity and constipation. Help breakdown fats, so your body can use them instead of store them. Acts as a natural appetitie suppressant May help speed up your metabolism May help lower blood glucose levels Helps restore alkaline acid balance Home remedy for dandruff and acne, taken externally I personally have gotten off of omneprazole for GERD and am using Raw Apple Cider Vinegar two times daily in a tall glass of juice. It makes the juice tart- but I feel so much better, have a noticed increase in energy and find that it seems to stabilize my moods. I am post menopausal- something you do n't have an issue with I suppose. As well as about 4 months out from a gall bladder surgery brought on by an episode of severe acute pancreatitis. I love the stuff! It is wonderful. Rose######Thanks everyone for the information. As far as bacteria goes, I should have said GI tract. That would have covered everything. :--RRB- Rose4me, it seems that I do n't really need vinegar because I pretty much have everything covered that you mentioned. For example: 1) potassium 2) calcium 3) regularity etc.. I eat a plant based diet with lots of legumes and green vegetables that are high in potassium, calcium and fiber (for regularity). And I think my alkaline-acid balance is good because of my plant based diet (I hardly eat any animal protein). And I have good blood pressure etc.. The reason I first got turned off of vinegar is because of a problem with frequent urination. I was using Balsamic Vinegar and suspected that it might be implicated. Of course I suspected some other things as well, like spices, certain fruits etc.. So I ca n't say it was all due to vinegar. It might have been a combination of things working together. From your list I tryed to figure out what might have contributed to frequent urination. One item was ``May help speed up your metabolism ''. Water goes through my system fast enough without speeding things up. :--RRB- Also, you mentioned anti-bacterial. I assume you mean bacteria in the GI tract. That would slow down digestion to help keep blood sugar steady, would n't it? What I have been reading lately is that most people do n't have enough bacteria. So the advice is to take probiotics. How do we resolve that? Do we want more bacteria or less? P.S. Thanks for the list you provided.######Could you tell me how many ounces of vinegar in how much water you use?

He is able to keep his insulin levels under control, but he has 2 problems that his doctor ca n't explain. 1. Constantly hungry. Even after a big solid meal, takes his insulin, 30 minutes later it seams like he never ate. I believe it is the insulin that tells his body that he needs food... but he does n't. 2. Weight gain. My husband does commercial sandblasting for a living, a very phyiscal job, but yet he keeps gaining weight each month. His doctor does n't understand about his job and the weight gain, she just tells him, ``You need to exercise. '' Does anybody have the same problems or can at least shed some light on the problems. Thank You, Jodi######When type 1 diabetics gain weight, it is normally because they are taking too much insulin. The insulin brings blood glucose down, causing the hunger and eating more food. Calories consumed exceed the weight-maintenance level, and this is what causes the weight gain. I have seen this in myself a number of times over the years. Reducing the insulin should help. But he he needs to lots of testing to get a handle on exactly what is happening and how to deal with it. Mark.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

Knowing I ca n't take the above meds still wants me on metforman, what now. No longer taking any meds past few weeks. BS staying about the same as if I was taking meds. Between 250 and 350 fasting. Is is time to change Dr and to what speciality if any? Body seems to be adjusting to high sugar and I feel fine. I try to eat healty and use splendra as replacement for sugar but still have sugar cravings. Need advise.######I definately would change to a new Dr may I suggest a good internal medicine Dr or a good endocrinologist. You really need to get those sugars under control yes you may be adjusting to it but in time it will take a toll on you high sugars can affect the eyes and kidneys and also you run many other risk such as heart failure. please find another dr.######Blood sugar between 250 and 350 fasting is WAY too high! You may feel fine now, but that elevated blood glucose can be doing damage to your entire body... all your organs, your arteries and veins, your eyes, etc.. You absolutely MUST find a way to get it down. My suggestion would be to see an endocrinologist. They are usually more knowledgeable about diabetes than a general internist, and with those blood sugars, you are going to need good diabetes management. There are other oral meds that you can take, plus and endo may be able to give better suggestions on how to tolerate even these meds (like starting off on lower doses until your body adjusts to them, etc.) Also, you might want to ask for a referrral to a Registered Dietician, as well as a Diabetes Education class. Bottom line... just because you 're a Type 2 diabetic does n't mean it does n't need to be taken seriously. You can develop ALL the complications that a Type 1 diabetic faces, with the possible exception of diabetic coma. Please change doctors if you need to, but take CARE of yourself!

After oe month blood examation showed fasting sugar in limits but post meal 190mg. Does she have diabites.There is also increase in her blood pressure.no wieght gain but weight loss appetite######Often times the fasting blood sugar levels are the last ones to show problems. The post-meal levels are sometimes a better gauge of things, and 190 is still a bit high. Of course, it depends on exactly when that test is taken. Post-meal bg levels tend to peak in a diabetic at the 2 hour mark (timed from when the meal is started, not when it is finished, and not get back to normal, pre-meal levels until the 3-hour mark. For non-diabetics, the peak is usually at one hour, and it 'll be back to normal by two hours. Since you mentioned weight loss, it is very important to not only determine if, in fact, she is definitely diabetic, but also what type. Uncontrolled diabetes of both types can lead to weight loss, but it is even more common in Type 1 diabetes. It probably would be a good idea for her to have an HbA1c (also referred to simply as an A1c)... this measures the average blood sugar level over the previous 8-12 weeks. If her A1c is between 5.7 to 6.4%, then she would be in the pre-diabetic range, which means she needs to learn how to eat properly to prevent it from getting worse; if her A1c is 6.5% or greater, then she is already diabetic. It still might be possible to manage it with diet and exercise, but it needs to be carefully monitored in either case. Ruth.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

My girlfriend has had type 1 since she was a very young girl (she is 30 now). She has been using an insulin pump for a few years. Her eating pattern is she may have a piece of fruit and yogurt for breakfast and then wait all day until around 6 to eat. I asked her if that is wise with her being diabetic. She said it does n't matter because she has the pump. Can someone please weigh in on that?######I ca n't comment on whether or not she is eating enough or has a disorder, I can tell you that the pump is wonderful for allowing you to skip meals or eat at irregular times. It was liberating!######DITTO! I love my pump for that very reason... no longer do I have to stop what I 'm doing to run and eat because it 's a certain time of day. And I can even fast once a year on Passover. I will say, however, that it 's generally not a good idea to go that long between meals. It actually promotes weight gain, as the body perceives you to be in starvation mode, so it does n't burn calories the way it should. This is true whether you 're diabetic or not. Your metabolism actually slows down, and later in life, when we usually become less physically active, that slower metabolism can cause weight gain. Ruth######Your GF may just be enjoying the freedom described by others, with the pump you are less of a slave to the clock about when you have to eat. But be warned, many type 1 diabetics can be silently battling a dangerous Eating Disorder called Diabulimia. I suffered from this for over 10 yrs and It almost killed me. I went to treatment and am happily living in recovery now, but its been said that 1 in ever 3 t1 diabetic women battle this at some point in their life.######Correct me if I 'm wrong, Namaste, but is n't diabulimia when diabetics withhold their insulin (causing a mild form of DKA) so that they lose weight rapidly? If her pump is set correctly and she 's not withholding insulin, I would think that she 's just gotten into the bad habit of not taking time for lunch. Or, possibly, trying to lose weight in what some would be considered a safer way than diabulimia- that is, eating a bit less so one needs less insulin, as insulin CAN cause weight gain in some people. And she may also find it very freeing to not HAVE to eat at certain times, especially since she 's had D for so long and was probably on some of the older insulins, like NPH, which absolutely necessitated eating meals at proscribed times. Ruth######Ruth you are correct about what diabulimia is, but what a lot of people dont know is that having a pump is an easy way to LOOK like you 're being a healthy diabetic but you can easily manipulate the pump to give only a fraction of the insulin to cover meals etc.. I know many suffering from this disease who did just that for years without anyone ever knowing. I hope that this isnt the case here, but I have dedicated my life to bring awareness to this issue. Its so much more prevalent then the medical world knows.######Thanks for the clarification, Namaste. Let 's hope that is n't the case here. So hard to know when one only gets part of a story... but then, that 's as true in real life, often, as it is on the internet. Be well, Ruth######I am Type I, but do n't have a pump. I have a couple of friends who have a pump. They love it. Their A1C is very good. They say it 's the pump that causes this. They are both quite thin and are thrilled they do n't have to eat any certain anount of food or eat at any certain time. They both skip lunch a lot! It may be that she is doing just fine with her insulin levels. Her A1C would determine that. If someone is losing weight or staying thin because they are taking too little insulin, it will show up on their A1C. I suffered from weight gain with insulin so, years ago, I let mine stay high. I lost lots of weight, but my A1C was terrible, at almost 10. You ca n't last long like that. It took a stay in the hospital with Ketoacidosis to scare me into proper dosing. I am now doing much better, but boy, the weight gain was terrible. I 'm trying to deal with that now.######Kendra, that 's part of the beauty of the pump. You can temporarily lower your basal rate while exercising (like taking back part of your lantus) and then not have to eat extra because of a low and undo the exercise. I found it easier to lose some weight with my pump..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I 'm 25 yrs old, 5 ' 3, about 160 lbs. I posted about this, sorta, in the diabetic thread. But I 'm hauling it over here, too. I 'm on 2 kinds of medicine. One is amaryl. It works wonderfully, no side effects. The other is Avandamet, which is part Avandia and part Metformin. The metformin helps some people lose weight, the Avandia makes some people gain weight. Well, the Avandia is where my problem lies. When I walked into my dr's office in May, I weighed 150 lbs, bloated from my period. The next week when I went back (after taking Avandamet for 1 week), I was up to 160 lbs. And even with my diabetic diet and the fact that I eat half as much as I used to, my weight has not changed. I have a pair of jeans (Old Navy, sz 10) that I 've had for years and not once had a problem buttoning that I ca n't fit into anymore and its killing me. Shape-wise, I 've also gained first in my middle. Always. Skinny legs, skinny arms, big tummy, big boobs. But where it used to be around my waist line, now its my lower tummy. The waist of my pants all fit the same, but the zipper area is snug (and those Old Navy Jeans are ultra low rise.) My hips used to be bony, and they are n't anymore. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do for this? I ca n't change how I eat any more. I 'm going to go back to the doc after my wedding (Sun) and see if he can change my medicine any, but until then...

Have had a full heart workup including EKG, two CTs, all lab tests, wore a heart monitor for a day, MRI, kidney workups, etc.. No abnormalities except some restricted flow from one kidney. My weight is normal, age 65.######Hello, sounds awful...! I have something similar and have been diagnosed with Pure Autonomic Failure, (PAF) which is a problem with the automatic peripheral nervous system. This failure affects blood pressure regulation which does the opposite of what it should do- drops when standing, exercising, climbing stairs and goes very high at night when lying down. It also affects the sweating response- in me this has stopped altogether so is dangerous in hot weather. As well, PAF can affect digestion, bladder and bowel function causing nausea, constipation, diarrhoea, uninary problems, etc.. There is some research into the cause being an antibody response attacking the nervous system, but this is n't the cause for everyone with PAF. I do n't know where you live but insist on seeing a neurologist who specialises in conditions of the autonomic system. In UK, the main place is the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. in US, I think it is Vanderbilt University.

Can somebody please help me out for this?######bestsellingincense, The sudden drops in blood pressure that can be lifethreatening are those associated with collapse of the cardiovascular system, caused by such things as:- Loss of blood from severe bleeding, either internally or externally- Extremely low body temperature- Extremely high body temperature- Heart muscle disease causing heart failure- Sepsis, a severe blood infection, sometimes called blood poisoning- Severe dehydration from vomiting, diarrhea, or fever- A reaction to medication or alcohol- A severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis Chronic low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious. But health problems can occur when blood pressure drops suddenly, and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply. This can lead to dizziness or lightheadedness. Sudden drops in blood pressure most commonly occur in someone who 's rising from a prone or sitting position to standing. This kind of low blood pressure is known as postural hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, or neurally mediated orthostatic hypotension. Postural hypotension is considered a failure of the autonomic nervous system-- the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary vital actions, such as the heartbeat-- to react appropriately to sudden changes. Normally, when you stand up, some blood pools in your lower extremities. Uncorrected, this would cause your blood pressure to fall. But your body normally compensates by sending messages to your heart to beat faster and to your blood vessels to constrict. This offsets the drop in blood pressure. If this does not happen, or happens too slowly, postural hypotension results. The cause of low blood pressure is n't always clear, but it may be associated with the following:- Pregnancy- Hormonal problems such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), diabetes, or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)- Over-the-counter medications- Overdose of high blood pressure drugs- Heart failure- Heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)- Widening, or dilation, of the blood vessels- Heat exhaustion or heat stroke- Liver disease Postural hypotension, which is low blood pressure when standing up suddenly, can happen to anyone for a variety of reasons, such as dehydration, lack of food, prolonged standing in the heat, or being overly fatigued. It can also be influenced by genetic make-up, aging, medication, dietary and psychological factors, and acute triggers, such as infection and allergy. Postural hypotension occurs most frequently in people who are taking drugs to control high blood pressure (hypertension). It can also be related to pregnancy, strong emotions, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or diabetes. The elderly are particularly affected, especially those who have high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Hypotension after meals is a common cause of dizziness and falls after eating. It 's believed to be caused by blood pooling into he vessels of the stomach and intestines. Several drugs are commonly associated with postural hypotension. These medications can be divided into two major categories:- Drugs used to treat high blood pressure, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. - Drugs that have hypotension as a side effect, including nitrates, drugs for Parkinson's disease, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, anti-anxiety agents, sedative-hypnotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. Common causes of naturally occurring postural hypotension include:- Dehydration and electrolyte loss, which may result from diarrhea, vomiting, excessive blood loss during menstruation, or other conditions- Age associated decline in blood pressure regulation, which may be worsened by certain health conditions or medications Certain diseases can cause postural hypotension. These include:- Central nervous system disorders, such as Shy-Drager syndrome or multiple system atrophy- Nerve problems, such as peripheral neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy- Cardiovascular disorders- Alcoholism- Nutritional diseases######Hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, dehydration causes the blood pressure, nutritional diseases is also the reasons to blood pressure..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Low Blood Pressure and Hypotension

Sometimes a headache and nausea along with it. Throughout the day I 'm really weak and its gotten worse since it started a few months ago. I 'm barely able to walk now and I get really really hot and then really cold for a long time and then back to a few minute period of really hot. I 'll sometimes lose vision and go blind for a few seconds. Sometimes I 'll be fine afterwards and other times I pass out. I 'm 17 so I know I 'm not menopausal yet. These episodes come in waves usually when i get up from lying down or sitting, but they come even while sitting or not doing anything too. Does anyone else get this or have any answers ???######Luna13, It sounds like you may have orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension-- also called postural hypotension-- is a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down. The most common symptom of orthostatic hypotension is feeling lightheaded or dizzy when you stand up after sitting or lying down for a while. This feeling, and other symptoms, usually happens shortly after standing up and generally only lasts for a few moments. Orthostatic hypotension symptoms include: * Feeling lightheaded or dizzy after standing up * Blurry vision * Weakness * Fainting (syncope) * Confusion * Nausea Occasional dizziness or lightheadedness may be relatively minor-- the result of mild dehydration, low blood sugar, or too much time in the sun or a hot tub, for example. Dizziness or lightheadedness may also happen when you stand after sitting for a long time, such as in a lecture, concert, or church. If these symptoms happen only occasionally, it 's usually not cause for concern. When you stand up, gravity causes blood to pool in your legs. This decreases blood pressure because there 's less blood circulating back to your heart to pump. Normally, special cells (baroreceptors) near your heart and neck arteries sense this lower blood pressure and counteract it by triggering your heart to beat faster and pump more blood, which stabilizes blood pressure. This is probably why your heart rate seems to be racing. In addition, these cells cause blood vessels to narrow, which increases resistance to blood flow and increases blood pressure. This can sometimes cause changes in the blood flow to the skin, thus making the patient feel hot or cold. Orthostatic or postural hypotension occurs when something interrupts the body's natural process of counteracting low blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension can be caused by many different things, including: * Dehydration. Fever, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, severe diarrhea and strenuous exercise with excessive sweating can all lead to dehydration. When you become dehydrated, your body loses blood volume. Even mild dehydration can cause symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, such as weakness, dizziness and fatigue. * Heart problems. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack, and heart failure. These conditions may cause orthostatic hypotension because they prevent your body from being able to respond rapidly enough to pump more blood when needed, such as when standing up. * Diabetes. Untreated diabetes can cause dehydration by causing frequent urination. This can trigger orthostatic hypotension. In addition, diabetes can damage the nerves that help send signals regulating blood pressure. * Nervous system disorders. Some diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy (Shy-Drager peripheral neuropathies), and amyloidosis, can disrupt your body's normal blood pressure regulation system. Some risk factors for orthostatic hypotension include: * Age. Orthostatic hypotension is common in those age 65 and older. As the body ages, the ability of special cells (baroreceptors) near the heart and neck arteries to regulate blood pressure can be slowed. Also, with age, it may be harder for the heart to beat faster and compensate for drops in blood pressure. * Medications. People who take certain medications, such as high blood pressure medication, have a greater risk of orthostatic hypotension. These include water pills (diuretics) and other drugs that treat high blood pressure; heart medications, such as beta blockers; drugs for Parkinson's disease or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); antidepressants; narcotics; and alcohol. Using drugs that treat high blood pressure in combination with other prescription and over-the-counter medications may cause low blood pressure. * Certain diseases. Parkinson's disease and some heart conditions put you at a greater risk of developing low blood pressure. * Heat exposure. Being in a hot environment can cause you to sweat and, possibly, cause dehydration, which can lower your blood pressure and trigger orthostatic hypotension. * Bed rest. If you have to stay in bed a long time because of an illness, you may become weak. When you try to stand up, you may experience orthostatic hypotension. Once you 're feeling better and regain your muscle strength, the orthostatic hypotension will likely improve. * Pregnancy. Because a woman's circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy, blood pressure is likely to drop. This could cause blood pressure to drop enough to cause orthostatic hypotension when standing up quickly. In addition, as the uterus expands, it can press on the large veins in the pelvis, reducing blood flow. Though most episodes of orthostatic hypotension are of short duration and mild, you may want to see your physician, since you are experiencing frequent symptoms and they are lasting longer than would be expected. This is because they can sometimes point to more-serious underlying problems. Make sure that you are not dehydrated and are eating a proper diet. You should maintain an exercise program, but do n't overdo it. If these episodes occur at times that may endanger you or others, take precautions. You may want to sit on the edge of the bed for a few moments, before standing, when you first get up in the morning (or after a nap). It may be helpful to keep a record of your symptoms, when they occur, how long they lasted, and what you were doing at the time. Take this with you, when you see the physician. Of course, there could be some other reason for your symptoms. But, it really does sound like you have at least some orthostatic hypotension when you stand up. You just need to find out why it is lasting so long. Good luck. Wishing you the best.######Thanks Gaelic ^_^.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Nausea

But a number of times a year, I get episodes which last for 4-6 weeks where I just ca n't get enough air. I burp and yawn through much of the day, especially after meals. Sometimes, the breaths I crave and partially satisfy through shoulder raising breathing cause tremendous chest pain. Anyway, my doctor recently suggested that it is a mild hernia. The hernia causes my stomach to rise and interfere with my capacity to breathe. Considering that I do have some of the other syptoms (gas, bloating, clearing throat often), it would make sense. Furthermore, my last 6 week episode got better after 5 days of vacation away from my twin, year old daughters who I pick up with reckless abandon- the wrong way perhaps, causing or exacerbating the hernia I might have.

I can find no information on this anywhere and am trying to understand if it causes an increase in pressure. I ask because my systolic blood pressure is stuck hovering around 142-145, and I have to find a way to lower below 140 by the end of the year without resorting to prescribed medication. I am extremely fit, in my early 20s, and exercise 1-2 hours most days and eat very healthy. I 'm hoping I can use pamabrom in the short term to drop my blood pressure a few points and to a degree replicate the effects of more powerful prescription diuretics. Anyway, my career rides on getting below 140 in the next few months and under no circumstances can I see a doctor (any diagnosis of high blood pressure is a career ender). I 'm taking all the semi-BS natural supplements that are supposed to help- garlic, hibiscus tea, L-Arginine, etc- but they do n't seem to really have an effect.

Omeprazole is one of the most widely prescribed drugs internationally and is available over the counter in some countries. Some of the most frequent side effects of omeprazole (experienced by over 1% of those taking the drug) are headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, trouble awakening and sleep deprivation, although in clinical trials the incidence of these effects with omeprazole was mostly comparable to that found with placebo. Other side effects may include iron and vitamin B12 deficiency, although there is very little evidence to support this. Proton pump inhibitors may be associated with a greater risk of fractures and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Patients are frequently administered the drugs in intensive care as a protective measure against ulcers, but this use is also associated with a 30% increase in occurrence of pneumonia. The risk of community-acquired pneumonia may also be higher in people taking PPIs. Since their introduction, proton pump inhibitors (especially omeprazole) have been associated with several cases of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, an inflammation of the kidneys that often occurs as an adverse drug reaction. PPI use has also been associated with fundic gland polyposis..######-General Forum Topics###-Pharmaceuticals

Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

I 'm totally not the typical pancreatitis patient- female, thin, fit, good diet, minimal alcohol consumption, no visible gall bladder stones on ultrasound... I had the pancreatitis for 5 days before taking myself to hospital. In those 5 days I saw two different GPs. One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain.

I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment.

Anything to rule out one or the other? I had acute pancreatitis and with the exception of fruit juice, I really dont ' crave sugar at all. If you want to rule out diabetes, your doc should help you discover what is going on with you. Hope you can resolve this. Keep us posted. Rose######One doctor immediately said chronic pancreatitis, since my levels have been so high but have rollercoastered over the past couple years. But they ca n't find a cause or a cure for it. All catscans and MRI's have shown everything to be normanl, no blockages, stones, or inflammation.######Pancreatitis and diabetes can be related. If you have chronic pancreatitis, your pancreas is apparently comprimised and not functioning at it optimum level. Have you been referred to an endochronologist? When I was in hospital and not able to have anything by mouth for 10 days, on day 6, they introduced I.V. nutrition. This I.V. bag of `food ' was mostly sugar, with electrolytes and other vital supplements. I have not previously been diagnosed a diabetic, although I was borderline gestational diabetic with my first child and not with the second. The I.V. food bag, caused my blood sugars to be all over the place. I had insulin shots every day- multiple times a day- while the food bag was on the I.V. pole. They kept increasing the insulin in the I.V. food bag, but still needed to give me the shots- my body just was too busy trying to heal the pancreas to regulate blood sugars too. I believe that my insulin levels are not right yet and it has been a month that I 've been out of the hospital now. I need to see my doc/intern and get blood sugars checked as well. Just saw the gastro doc and still have a couple issues from that hospitilization episode yet to take care. I would make sure the pancreas is able to produce the insulin you need- You need to be proactive about it. Keep us posted Rose######I am not a medical professional but I do know from experience that yes diabetes and pancreatitis can be related. I have type 1 and type 2 diabetes along with chronic pancreatitis. They dont know if I was born with the chronic pancreatitis yet but looking back on my life long medical history it looks like I may have been. This is likely to be the reason why I am a double diabetic. So far lots of places I have read about online say that both chronic and acute pancreatits can lead to diabetes.######Thank you for all of the responses everyone. I have never been able to get a doctor to send me to an endocronologist, nor could I get one to accept me, because my blood sugar is always normal.

My left knee has begun to swell an feels abnormal to such degree that bending it feels like there is a small elastic band around it. So when I Bend it, it feels like it becomes ``Tighter. '' There is not real pain here just a little hard to walk on it downstairs mainly. This all began while I was sitting at my computer. I sit with my knees bent all the time and I decided I was uncomfortable so I lowered my knee sideways to sit on my foot then it felt like my knee needed to ``Pop '' but when I straightened it out and moved it a little bit, I noticed that it was not popping and began to feel tight. It has since begun to swell more than that of my right knee. It is uncomfortable but not too much of an issue. Do you have a solution to what may be the issue? (I plan to go get it checked later today since it is still only 4am) The main issue for me is the swelling..######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Knee & Hip Problems

I 'm quite mystified by a knee problem I 've been having about 3 months now, and not certain if this came from some hard yoga movements I had done as I feel it should have healed by now. What happens is that off and on, I will get a slight swelling on my right side of the knee. There is no pain, but slight stiffness. Now the exact location. If you stretch your leg out all the way, note there is a kind of indentation on the sides of the knee, about the height of the top of the knee cap, which seems to be between two tendons. This is a normal knee. (Note there 's an indentation on both sides.) It is that indentation on the outer right knee that swells. Not a lot, but maybe a section about the size of my thumb. It may recede completely for several days, then come back. Has been going on for three months, and ca n't find anything online like it. Minor local swelling on right side, no pain at all, minor stiffness, off and on? Any ideas are greatly appreciated!.######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Knee & Hip Problems

I never thought to ask my doctor if the replacements had nickle and he never asked me either. So I was given a replacement without any nickle but it 's scary to think that I would have received one with nickle had I had not found this out earlier. I actually had a metal tests years ago and that is how I knew I was allergic but also when I was young I could not wear earrings with nickle in them and had to buy nickle free, if I did n't, my ears would get red, hot and swell.

History is I have had pain in the left knee and when walking I get a pinching in the knee (grabbing feeling) which stops me in my track. After diagnosis of the pain being from Arthritis, I had a cortisone shot which helped some but did not take away all of the pain. My doctor told me he would not give me another shot unless the first one lasted at least 3 months. I have done PT which causes the knee to swell and hurt after. The physical therapist has now released me because she said my doing the therapy is causing the knee to become inflamed and irritated and that is not what they want to do. I was told by the PT to not do anything for a couple of weeks and then gradually add in exercise- I have tried this and I am gaining weight (which is what the doctor told me to loose to help). The doctor did mention if the shot did not last he would then recommend arthroscopic surgery to clean up the area (trim up the cartilage, etc.). My question is has anyone had this done and did it help with the swelling and pain afterwards. Also, how long were you out of commission or off the leg?.######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Knee & Hip Problems

It started affecting my sinuses about a week ago, so I started taking cold medicine. Instead of getting better, it just got worse. Three days later I would blow my nose and get green-yellow mucous. The next day I woke up and hurt from the crown of my head and down the left side of my head in my ear, jaw, neck, and shoulder. The pain was so bad it even hurt to eat. This is by far the worse sinus infection I have ever had! So, I went to the doctor. He prescribed an antibiotic and an antihistimine (my blood pressure was slightly up, which could have been because of the cold medicine, but it caused him to not want to give me a decongestant). i 'm still hurting in my head, ear, and jaw, but not as bad. Mucous is still very colored. But, yesterday, I started hurting in my right shoulder-- more like on the tip of the collarbone near my neck. It has some sharp pains, and sometimes dull and achy. I have n't done anything physically that would have caused this type of pain. It does n't go into the shoulder itself, it just feels like it is in that collarbone. It does hurt also when I move it some and when I cough. Is there any way that this pain could be connected to a sinus infection or even to antibiotics? I 'm just wondering because I really have no other explanation to the pain-- if this is even an explanation.######I am having the exact same problem, and there has been no antibiotic or steroid that has done any good. I am actually waking up at night some times and cant breath because the mucus is blocking my airway. And my neck is killing me from my collar bone clear up to my jaw. Did you ever figure anything out or is your problem still going on? Thanks######My sinus infection has cleared up. But, I still am hurting in both collarbones and shoulders and neck. I 've noticed that my shoulders burn when I do anything that requires using my arms alot of lifting them over my head. But, it all started with the sinus infection. I do n't have any answers,. . just the pain !!! My muscles just ache bad. My friends think it 's stress, but that does n't explain why it started with the sinus infection.######My sinus infection too has cleared up, by my neck and collabone pain is worse than ever and also started with the sinus infection. Have you figured anything out or had any luck? Thanks!######I have cold/sinus infection symptoms also, and a pain in the back of my throat in the mornings which gradually fades with drinking and a pain in my collar bone which is sharp. I also feel lathargic and have a horrible fell/taste in my mouth. Did you guys get this solved?######I 've had a sinus infection for a month now, I 've also had ringing ears for 2 months. . The sinus pain is still here after the doctor had prescribed me antibiotics, I 've been refered to specialists so I 'm waiting for an appointment. The other day all the top of my left arm was achy, and then last night I had really bad stabbing pains in my left collarbone, it 's gone but all the back of my neck seems achy. Anyone experienced something g like this? (######I have these same issues. Its like theres a wall of (clear) mucus sitting in the spot above my throat and behind my nose... but theres no breathing issue. My pain is also on my left side from crown to eye to jaw to lympnodes to collar bone to ring and pinkey finger. I now believe whatever is in yogurt intensifies the pain bc I cut it out of my diet then ate it today and 6 hrs later my collar bone is aching.

First, she has never slept well. She eats every three hours around the clock. Second, my son had two unexplained seizures when he was her age. This morning, Morgan's breathing pattern changed quite noticeably. She seemed to struggle and was very rhythmic. She was not not jerking or twitching, however. This episode went on for at least a minute with me trying to awaken her... she scared me. she was floppy and pretty much unrespnsive during this episode. near the end of the episode, she seemed to arouse but then quickly settled back into the strange breathing and it took a few more seconds- maybe 20 -30 for her breathing to regulate. What in the world was that ??? Just normal baby breathing? A seizure? A bad dream? Apnea? (she did not turn blue) I am at a loss as to whether to call my doctor or not. I already have a reputation as a over concerned mother and it seems we always deal with something unusual with both my kids from time to time. Id hate to call and just be laughed at. So someone please advise me if this sounded like normal infant sleep? Thanks so much !! STephanie######Mothers know best. Never worry about what the docs or nurses are going to say. My sister's newborn had seizures. He was adopted. They are very hard to detect in very young children. His turned out to be a thyroid problem. The birth mother had a problem with her thyroid and it messed up his to start with. He could of died or had permanent brain damage. It 's worth checking out if you have any doubts. They put him on a special formula and gave him pure calcium and he has never had another seizure. He 's nine now. Best wishes!.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Epilepsy

I 've had to quit working out and my job (I 'm a personal trainer). It takes all my energy just trying to catch that deep breath, but even when I do it 's not a minute or 2 before I need to do it again. Bloodwork came back normal, echocardiagram also normal. Spirometry test during a breathing attack revealed I was only expelling 20% of the air from my lungs that I should be so I was prescribed inhalers. They only exacerbated the problem. They seem to freeze up my breathing muscles. It does n't feel like my lungs are the problem, it feels like my diaphragm or other involuntary breathing muscles are the culprits. Taking klonopin helps, but I ca n't exercise on it. Anything that increases my heartrate throws me into a breathing attack where my muscles freeze up. I 've had this problem on a small scale most of my life, but it has gotten inifintely worse since I moved to Houston 2 years ago. I should mention that I 've been to the emergency room 3 times and each time they tell me my oxygen saturation is 100% and send me home. Can somebody please point me in a direction for help? I know it 's not anxiety, though it is aggravated by anxiety, but this happens when I 'm sound asleep not dreaming. I will wake up having to take a deep breath and sometimes can only get one in certain weird positions. Please help. If there is a doctor out there your advice is invaluable to me!######Have you been able to get any answers to this yet? There can be so many different causes, such as Asthma, Emphysemia, Allergies, Panic Attacks. Breathing difficulty, whether sudden or long term, should always be taken seriously. Though many causes are harmless and are easily corrected, any difficulty breathing requires a thorough medical evaluation. Have you had a chest x-ray or a Pulmonary Function Test? Here is a website that may give you some suggestions and help: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/ar ticle/003075. htm######No, I have n't gotten any answers yet. Since my posting I 've been to 3 different doctors and none of them can figure out what 's wrong. I think my next stop will be a neurologist as I 'm starting to suspect a neurological muscle disorder, since it feels like my breathing muscles are locking up.######Well let us know how it turns out with the neurologist!######I am looking for help with this to. This exact same problem is occuring in a client i am currently training. I to am a personal trainer.

He has been everywhere from the hospital to lung specialists who tell him his lungs are 100% fine. It doesnt make sense though seeing as he smoked more than 2 million cigarettes in his life. He started young and would smoke a large pack a day easily. He has stopped smoking for 2 years now though but still he has terrible breathing problems.

It has been kind of crooked my whole life, almost like deformed, but straight. Well I have been having pain in the finger once in a while and when the pain would come it would be so bad it would hurt for a week and then go away... This has been on and off for about 10 years or so. Now it is constant. I have so much pain the in the finger that it is like a burning stabbing pain. I ca n't pick anything up like a coffee mug or anything with a handle or it hurts so bad. It generally hurts between where the hand starts and the first knuckle on my middle finger. My finger does n't swell, that I know of... I have put ice on it, I have put heat on it for 15 minutes at a time each off and on, I have taken every otc medication for the pain. I have gotten to the point where I try to make a fist, I ca n't get a good fist, before my hand feels tired and fatigued. Is there any thing I can do, or can someone suggest to me what could be wrong, is there a brace that I can wear? I have been working my hands lately more than I ever have and it is hard not to complain to my Mother in law, which I am doing most of the stuff for, she has really bad arthritis in her hands and she has the basal joint arthritis in both hands. I am now doing things for her that she ca n't do, as in opening jars, alot of different planting, digging, weeding... making her beds because she does n't have the strength to do it... Now I just found out today that I have to go back into homes and help pack up which was my job before but the new girl that they have had got a full time job so now I have to do this again, which I really do n't mind it, but I will be working more again with my hands. I just want to cry because I am in a situation where I ca n't not do it. I work for the family business and you do or you do... I have n't had a sick day in 15 years. I just want one day where I do n't have to do anything, and I ca n't get that, because as soon as I get that day, I have to come home and do it here all over again... Thank God I live in an apartment, because I could not do yard work twice.... I think I would rather shoot myself. Sorry that most of this is just B \* tching but I ca n't take too much more.... Thanks for letting me vent######Hello, You say that you can not make a fist. I had similar issue with my right hand. When I tried to make a fist, it only goes half way and lacked strength. I do a simple exercise that was taught to me by a physical therapist. After making half fist, hold all fingers with other hand and go forward and backward. Do this in sets of five and repeat 2-3 sets. Hope that helps your condition. It does help my hand by flexing the inner tendons and after exercise, I can make fist and do other chores with both hands..######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Arthritis

But seriously you MIGHT be able to lose 4-5 lbs (this is including water weight) if you do the following- 1) Dont eat any starches or carbs: No pop No chips/ junk food No WHITE bread (eat wheat bread IF you must) No potatoes or yams No WHITE rice (brown rice in fist size portions is good) 2) Yes drink lots of water, your body will flush out extra water (water weight) 3) Do cardio for 30 min when you wake up on an empty stomach (or if you ca n't then any time of the day). Doesnt matter what, walking, running, rollerblading, biking just do something 4) If you have access to a weight room do some weight resistance, muscle burns more calories than fat. It will also speed up your metabolism 5) Keep all meals to the size of your fist, and eat 6-7 of these small meals a day (2 hours apart or so) It will be hard but if you do follow these rules you 'll be shredded in no time.

The history here does not specify which organ has been affected by the cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a carcinomatous cancer occurring in many different organs, including the skin, lips, mouth, esophagus, urinary bladder, prostate, lungs, vagina, and cervix. It is a malignant tumor of squamous epithelium (epithelium that shows squamous cell differentiation). The treatment and prognosis of the cancer varies with the site of involvement. Squamous cell cancer is one of the most rapid growing cancer, that is occasionally resistant to treatment. Early detection and treatment before widespread of the cancer helps in prolonging the survival rate. Detection in late stages when the cancer has spread to multiple sites can be difficult to control. You might consider to consult your oncologist who can clear any doubts and explain the future course of action. I hope this helps..######-Cancer###-Cancers

What BS level is considered being diabetic?######If I remember right, it is 126 fasting. Your doctor is right, you can avoid or at least delay developing diabetes by losing weight and eating right. A non-diabetic fasting BS (blood sugar) range is 70-110. It is in your best interest to lose weight if you are overweight, eat lean meat, non-starch veggies, avoid junk foods, sugar, potatoes, rice, flour, desserts, sugar sweetened beverages or soda pop. Avoid high fat meals. Fat causes greater insulin resistance. EXERCISE is very important. Walking is excellent exercise and will help lower BS (blood sugar). In other words make a ``lifestyle '' change for life and you will be much more healthy and most likely will avoid developing full fledge diabetes. Do n't waste any time in taking measures to get fasting BS down. Not only that, but get a glucometer and test 2 hrs. after eating a meal and be sure your choice of food and serving sizes will keep BS down to 120 or less. Testing 2 hrs. after meals is even more important than the fasting BS. There is also a blood test called the A1C which averages blood sugars over the past 3 months. This will tell how well your body is handling the foods you eat over that period of time. Non-diabetic will have an A1C test below 6. Once you get your fasting BS down in a non-diabetic range and the 2 hr. after meals BS down to non-diabetic range, then you can gradually introduce a little of other foods back into diet as long as the BS remains in the non-diabetic range. I personally have type 2 diabetes, diagnosed with fasting BS 151, control in non-diabetic range via diet/exercise for the past 3 years. I lost 65 lbs. I know you can and will do what is necessary to avoid developing diabetes. You have had a wake up call, so, please take advantage and get control. Do an internet search for ``prediabetes '' and ``insulin resistance ''. Also learn all you can about diabetes via internet searches.######Thanks for the advice. Monday I have a blood test, where I give blood and urine and then drink a gulose type drink and for the next 3 hours, on the hour give more blood and urine each time.Do you know any thing about this type of test?######Mikael, What you 've described is called a glucose tolerance test, and it 's another way of determining if you 're diabetic or not. If you come out positive for diabetes, make sure you ask your doctor for a referral to a Registered Dietician for advice on diet and meal planning. There are many ways to approach diet in relation to keeping your blood glucose under control, and an RD can tell you all of them and figure out which way will work best for you. At this stage, diet and exercise may be all you need, but make sure you stay on top of this. Ruth######I 'd show your doctor this new info... I would be careful with dieticians, also. . many are ADA indoctrinated and rule out Low Carb eating as an option for weight loss and control... and it should at least get a chance for review because it is a very powerful tool for gaining control and/or preventing onset. The Joslin Center (and ADA) have recently updated their ``non-diabetic '' ranges. If your blood sugars are above these numbers, then you might have diabetes or pre-diabetes. The new numbers I refer to are probably lower then the ones your MD checked yours against, but are likely to be used by an up to date diabetes MD in any evaluation. These are the new blood sugar readings in (mg/dL): Before Breakfast 60-100 mg/dL Before lunch supper and bedtime: 60-120 mg/dL 1 hour after meals: < or = 140 mg/dL 2 hours after meals < or = 120 mg/dL 2am- 4 am > or = to 70 mg/dL A1c 4.0 to 6.0% (indicates average blood sugars over last three months) \*\* as reported by the Joslin Diabetes Center at Upstate Medical University######mikael26288, You will get a lot of advice about diet, but it is critical that you work with a registered dietitian. Doctors typically give poor advice on diet (usually recommending too drastic a restriction). It is absolutely critical that you eat enough food and nutrients for your body size. Often people make drastic changes that are unhealthy, and that will not help you get better. I sound like a broken record here, but you must calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) to determine how many calories you should eat. This is soooo important. A person who is 250 lbs needs a LOT more calories than a person who is 150 lbs. You can and will lose weight EASILY if you are aware of your BMR. Do a google search on ``BMR Calculator. '' Also start to learn more about the ``glycemic index '' (another google search)- this refers to how quickly foods convert into blood glucose. For example, an apple has a much lower glycemic index than a banana, even though they both have the same number of carbs. The goal is to eat foods with a low glycemic index to help stabilize your blood glucose levels throughout the day (avoiding the highs and lows). Also, different people respond differently to foods- so keeping track of your blood glucose and what you eat is important- it will help you learn what causes your blood glucose levels to go up and what foods you tolerate better. Consider it a blessing that you are able to taked control now, before you start to suffer from some irreverable effects of diabetes.######Are these plasma based or whole blood based readings?.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Diabetes

I am wondering do these drugs affect normal people as well? I mean would they cause the confusion of a regular person who takes them too much or on a regular basis? How do these drugs relate to prevention or cause of dementia for normal people? I know there are many causes for dementia. But I wonder if these 2 drugs are not good for people with dementia, how good would that be for any normal person if we are concerned about our brain's cognition level? Thanks for any input. Nina######Have no clue about Ativan but doubt that benedryl causes such issues. It does make one drowsy- after all, it 's the PM in Tylenol PM. So lethargy, etc can certainly be side effects. Just seems that if there was a problem with it that the wide pread usage of Tylenol PM would be impacted.######I do n't think either causes or prevents dementia. They are both used by younger people without the same effects they have on the elderly/dementia patients. The elderly have proven more susceptible to the side effects of benedryl. It causes a worsening in Glaucoma. It can increase BP which is often a problem in the elderly or lower BP making them more susceptible to falls. It can thicken secretions which can cause various problems in the elderly. Elderly men with prostate enlargement can have trouble urinating. I can also dry out the mucus membrane. I also makes you thirsty which causes problem with those on fluid restriction. Constipation is a side effect that is more dangerous in the elderly. Not sure of the reasons why but... Benadryl can cause memory loss in the elderly. A study conducted by University of Pittsburgh researchers followed elderly individuals given either benzodiazepine, such as Valium, Xanax and Ativan, or Benadryl for sleep. Benadryl was associated with an increase in cognitive decline. Many elderly individuals are on multiple medications. Benadryl can interact with some commonly prescribed drugs also used for sedation, pain and sleep, and also some antidepressants. It can also interfere with blood pressure lowering drugs, such as clonidine and propranolol (a beta blocker). Side effects of Benadryl that can affect anyone can be especially problematic for elderly individuals with multiple existing health problems and on a variety of medications. Ativan is highly addictive even in the younger population and should not be used long term. Beyond this the elderly may not experience relief of anxiety with Ativan. It may have the opposite effect on the elderly, causing symptoms including mental/mood changes and increased anxiety. It is also not recommended for patients with depression... and many elderly dementia patients suffer from depression. It should not be used in patients with compromised respiratory systems... and many elderly dementia patients have compromised respiratory systems. Maybe this helps with the understanding Love, deb######Thanks, Deb! What about people who may be in the middle of dementia but are not diagnosed? Should n't they stop taking these drugs for protection? Sometimes I think I need to stop Benadryl which I took for allergy or sleeping before. What if I have early dementia... So I am stopping Benadryl. Not that I may have dementia. Hugs, Nina######Benedryl has been safely used for occasional treatment of allergy symptoms for a long time. Though the sedative effect has been know for years, only recently has it been introduced as a sleep aid when in combination with OTC pain medication. It does have side effects. You need to know those side effects and how they might affect any other medical issues that you might have. Actually you need to do this for all medications that you take... OTC included! Taking a a medication occasionally is not the same as taking it frequently. If you need a sleep aid try the Melatonin. A diagnosis does n't mean anything except you have put a label on the disease that you have. If you have dementia, you have dementia. With or with out that diagnosis it is the same. Many people avoid diagnosis. It is a way of denying there is anything wrong. But that does n't change the fact that you have the disease. If there is any problem with cognition you need to have it checked out and heed the warnings on medications that could actually be causing the cognition decline. The benedryl warning is not just for those with dementia but also for the elderly population with other medical problems. Just be aware, know yourself, and your medical problems. Then make a good decision for yourself Love, deb######It seems to me that \*\* all \*\* drugs have side effects. Many of these side effects are usually so mild to be insonsequential, provided the person is relatively strong and healthy. Among the elderly and infirm, the usual redundancy and excess capacity to compensate are decreased, even though they have yet to dip below the threshold and become symptomatic at baseline. The closer one edges towards this threshold, the greater chances the patient will have these side effects..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Alzheimer's Disease & Dementia

They experience sudden mood swings frequently, and feel very agitated and anxious very easily. At times, they wander about aimlessly, yell, start crying, or display emotions of combativeness and aggression. Sleep disturbances, inappropriate sexual behaviour, hallucinations and delusions are a part of life for these folks too. These persons are afflicted with Dementia. How do you understand dementia? What symptoms of dementia have you seen exhibited among our elders?######General Dementia are usually apparenent with older people and it starts off with very mild to moderate forgetfulness. Some stay in that categorie while other go a bit deeper into the desease into a much more fearfull forgetfulness. Forgeting occasions, events, things that happend yesterday and years ago. While on the other hand, slight short term dementia may just have occasional forgetfulness. Things like what they had for breakfast that morning or where they went yesterday. The slight stage normally the person is very aware that they can not remember as well relating to the present, where a worse case would not remember years ago which is what we call long term memory loss. Short term memory loss in the elderly is not uncommon at all. Yet there are some up into thier 90s that can remember when they were a child and who thier best friend was and where they were born..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Alzheimer Disease

The person in question suffers from anxiety and has been prescribed ozaxepam -15 mg twice daily. Appears to have little effect on the anxiety. Would such a dose add to the person's mental confusion?######Yes, Serapax is for anxiety. 15 mg a twice a day fits into the usage for mild to moderate anxiety. It is a CNS (Central Nervous System) depressant. From what I have found there is no clinical evidence that age makes a different in this medication except that the dosage need to be started at a lower dosage than for other patients, and it appears that is what your doctor has done. These newer CNS depressants do have less side effect than the older benzos such as Ativan and Xanax which are not recommended for the elderly. But they are addictive and their effectiveness tends to decrease over time so that a higher dosage is needed to obtain the same effect. Also know that it takes several weeks (4 to 6 usually) to know the full effect of the medication. My Mom was finally put on Geodon which is NOT recommended for elderly dementia patients because of the slightly increased risk of stroke or heart attack associated with this medication in the elderly dementia patient. But after months of manic behavior and trying many other medications this seemed to be the one that worked for her. The level of her anxiety was such that she was miserable and the risk has been well worth the benefit for her. So you have to take a lot into consideration when deciding on a medication. Sadly there is not many clinical trial for the effectiveness of psychotic medications on elderly dementia patients. It 's a hit and miss, best guess, which is not always the best. But My best guess is that this was a good choice to try for your Mom at this time Make friends with your pharmacist. Doctor prescribe meds but it is the pharmacist that KNOWS the drugs, their effectiveness, the side effects, and the interactions. When it comes to medications I trust my pharmacist above and beyond the physician. They are the medication experts !!!! Love, deb.######-Brain & Nervous System###-Alzheimer's Disease & Dementia

I have seen B12 deficiency referenced as a potential cause of such symptoms, alternative to Alzheimer's-- and I have seen at least one article in a prominent newspaper implicating such a deficiency in the dementia of one elderly patient-- however I have also read in a medical text that this explanation is a relic from the 1950s to which the medical community no longer subscribes. I was also told by one neurologist that in 25 years of practice, he never encountered an older patient whose dementia went away with the help of additional B12. So what is actually the current state of thinking-- does anyone believe that some patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's due to normal MRI etc. might simply suffer from low B12?######I 've heard that those with Alzheimer's are more likely to be deficient in Vitamin D.

Initially you are bound to have issues with you mother bugging it. I found that making sure the bag does n't get too full helps a lot. Especially with gas. That may mean altering her diet so she is n't producing as much gas. Things like corn, beans and carbonated beverages, drinking through straws, eating too fast, chewing gum, and coughinging a lot can all cause more gas. There are things like gas-x and what not that help with all the gas. Also putting her in dresses opposed to a shirt and pants helps so she ca n't get to it as easily. I, myself have had a colostomy for about 1 1/2 years now. I do n't notice that I have it so much unless the bag is full.

Not being hydrated properly, can lead to headache, too. Actually, staying hydrated can help preventing headaches. It is known that fatigue causes tension type of headaches, and fatigue is a side effect of dehydration. By drinking enough glasses of water every day, you 'll treat fatigue and headache. Getting a warm shower, helps in relaxing the tensed muscles (reason for tension headache), and relieves the headache. What 's the type of the headache you get? Can you describe the intensity of these headaches?######well thanx for response but the pain is gone! the area of pain was in occipitalis? muscle... i might ev damaged the nerve i guess. fro last few days i could feel that they were going away. . also my neck is little soured... i kinda landed uncomfortably during wrestling... if i can grade pain 1-10 i would give it 4######i have the same thing to morlun. but i just cant get rid of it. when do u think it will wheare off######This was probably a case of occipital neuralgia. It is a type of headache characterized by piercing, throbbing, or electric-shock-like chronic pain in the upper neck, back of the head, and behind the ears, usually on one side of the head. Usually, the pain of occipital neuralgia begins in the neck and then spreads upwards. Following things can be reason for experiencing this kind of headache: irritation or injury to the occipital nerves, which can be the result of trauma to the back of the head, pinching of the nerves by overly tight neck muscles, and, frequent lengthy periods of keeping the head in a downward and forward position. As a wrestler you are in a risk group of people who can suffer from this type of headache. This pain often improve with therapy involving heat, rest, anti-inflammatory mediations, and muscle relaxants.######thanx for response... yea it is only one side... pain is mostly when i wake up. like this morning i had pain for maybe 5-10 minutes and it is gone now and i am feeling great. i guess it is not that seriouse cuz it does not hurt that much at all######i think got the same kind of headache but its also burning on some parts of my body like back and forearms... it started yesterday after work out at the gym... the pain is not going away and it hurts all the time... is it the same kind of migrain? how to treat?######You mention shaking head up and down but what if you shake side to side and get a long lasting headache?######I also have pain when I shake my head up and down but not side to side.

He was sent to a kidney specialist in 2003, who took him off Hyzaar, saying it was damaging his kidneys, and put him on Doxazosin 4 mg. (Cardura) for bp. The problem with this medication is that it causes his legs and middle to swell and he has shortness of breath. For this problem, the Dr. prescribed Zaroxolyn (2.5 mg.) which, for him is a very powerful drug. After just one pill (which he takes when he feels he absolutely needs it- he is afraid to take it regularly) his Potassium level can plummet, so he takes extra potassium.This is guesswork too- we are constantly refining the dosage. If potassium & other electrolytes get too low he gets ``zapped '' by his defibrillator and he is anxious at times wondering if this is going to happen! He is now getting his potassium level checked every week to ``stay on top '' of the situation. This swelling started when he was put on Doxazosin and we do not want to go back to something harmful for his kidneys, but we wish there was something else out there for him!In addition to the drugs aforementioned, he takes daily: ALLOPURINOL 200 MG, AMIODARONE 200 MG, DEMADEX 60 MG, METOPROLOL 100 MG, PLAVIX 75 MG, POTASSIUM 60 MG Will appreciate all replies. Thank you.######That 's a tough one to dig into. The Doxasozin is an ALPHA-blocker that is used to treat prostate swelling and more recently to treat heart failure (wwhich is your husband's condition.) THe swelling is common and by the same mechanism is probably causing fluid builup in his lungs and shortness of breath (which the heart failure only adds to. So then they piled on a potent diuretic, Zaroxolyn... to replace the diuretic in Hyzaar that was supposed to be destroying his kidneys. So then the diuretic, like most diuretics, can cause gout... hence the allopurinol. Are you sure the Potassium is n't 60 MeQ, 60 mg. is a vanishingly small dose. The amiodorone is to slow the heart an avoid rhythm problem... unfortunately, it too can cause breathing difficulties. The demadex is a loop diuretic (torsemide) simiolar to lasix... another attempt to drain water out of him. Though this mess of drugs is best handled by a specialist, I 'd say the worst fly in the ointment is the doxasozin which is causing the swelling and breathing problems that require the two diuretics to overcome. Ask his doctor if he can lose this medication. So often we see what looks like Drug A causes problem B and Drug C is addded to treat B but causes condition D so drug E is added to treat THAT... and so on til you 've done all your ABC's can your head and body are spinning out of control. ! Good luck; you have your hands full.######Lenin, thanks so much for your reply. The Potassium IS MEQ's (not mgs.) It seems obvious to us that the Doxazosin is the problem but the DR. has been unwilling to change it. He had tried several others before Doxazosin and says he has run through most of the ones he can take. We 'll work on it! Thanks..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Late last year Amlodipine 10mg was added to the regime. I immediately lost energy, gained weight and developed abdominal pains which eventually became constipation. I have weaned myself slowly back to 2.5 mg and hope things eventually correct themselves. My GP admitts that Amlodipine can cause constipation in some people and my pharmacist agrees. If that is so I want off this medication. It 's getting me depressed and down. I would rather have slightly increased BP. Does this CCB affect others?######Your not alone. My husband takes Metoprolol... Losartan and Amlodipine for stubborn BP as well. Yes he also gets constipated for a day or two but takes a Probiotic 3 times a week which has regulated his system. Usually the Probiotic is mostly for Diarrhea but it does help him with the constipation. We make sure we take a Probiotic Acidophilus which both our Cardio and PCP recommended, so far... so good.

Amlodipine is notorious for causing ankle and leg swelling (edema). I believe their are definitely better calcium blockers. I think Diliatazem or Verapamil supposed to be more effective with less side effects. Maybe the Candesartan or Metoprolol dosage can be increased and you can eliminate the Amlodipine. Candesartan and Metoprolol are very good drugs. I believe the Doxazosin is also used for prostate conditions. I 'm not to sure about the Doxazosin.######constipation is a common side effect of calcium channel blockers.

Low-dose thiazide diuretics are a cornerstone of antihypertensive therapy and preferred first-line agents due to effectiveness, safety, tolerability and low cost.

Most patients will require combination therapy with more than one agent to achieve blood pressure control (63% of patients required? 2 drugs for control at 5 years; this is encouraging since the rate of blood pressure control in treated Canadian patients is about 13% 4). ? - blockers (e.g. doxazosin) are not first-line agents for hypertension based on unfavorable outcomes (?

Could I double up on any of the currant meds in the meantime?######Only your doctor can tell you whether you need more medication. Since you do n't seem to have an adequate control of your blood pressure at the moment, some changes to your drug regimen or dosing might be necessary. How long have you been hypertensive and on medication? Have there been any changes to your lifestyle or circumstances recently? Stressful situations, anxiety (fluctuating hormone levels) and many other triggers can cause dramatic transient blood pressure spikes. Even a fatty or salty fast food meal can send one's blood pressure soaring. Certain hormonal disorders and medical conditions can have the same effect on blood pressure. You 'll have to work with your doctor to determine the cause of your blood pressure spikes. As a rule, people are advised not to double up their medication doses unless directed to do so by their physicians. All drugs are therapeutic (in most people) when used properly but also toxic when a certain point has been reached. That is why the maximum recommended daily doses are rarely exceeded. Good luck!

Then in March 2008, I started seeing twitching of the little toe on that foot. This has steadily increased and now the toe jumps around all the time, except when I 'm sleeping (and has progressed to involve the two neighbor toes). I have been to a neurologist since my family MD thinks it is neurologic and not related to the bone fusion. I have had nerve conduction studies and EMG, both showing involuntary movement of the muscles of the toe and also in the outer leg a few inches about the ankle. I did have a guidewire break off when they were placing the pin in my great toe. They retrieved the wire through the bottom of my big toe where I had a knot for some time and now if I push hard on that area the toe movement stops. I wonder if it could be nerve damage or pin rejection, but the orthopedist says no and he sent me back to a neurologist. The neurologist gave me dilantin, carbidopa/levadopa, and mirapex. They all did nothing. I had a brain MRI and it was negative. I have had a Copper toxicity study and it was negative. I go to a specialist of movement disorders in March, but I am thinking I need a second opinion from a different orthopedist. I have always felt it could be an adverse reaction to the pin still in my toe. Anyway this condition is very uncomfortable. The movement is constant and is like muscles being overworked. It aches clear up my leg and the foot feels cramped most all the time. Anybody have any ideas? HELP!######IT sounds kind of like a focal dystonia, which CAN be caused by injury. I have generalized dystonia, and I get the same repetitive spasming of my toes. My feet are permanently curled, except in sleep, but the toes contract rapidly, especially when I 'm lying down. I know what you mean about it spreading all the way up your leg. The doctor put me on carbidopa/levodopa a few months ago and I had a reverse reaction; it caused my dystonia to become so bad I could n't care for myself. But when I was on the carb/levo the spasming in my feet was unbearable, for hours and hours and it sent this fatigued deep pain all the way up my legs. You might see if you can get in to the movement doc earlier than march. Good luck..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Neuromuscular Diseases

I have a subset of lupus called Mixed Connective Tissue Disease. A few years it was not given its own name-it was called ``lupus ''. However, it does tend to involve the digestive tract more than SLE. Anyway, I have been very happy with the medicine. For my arthritis pain, I 'm now taking concerta, a form of ritalin. It releases dopamine in the brain and helps fight chronic pain. I had tried every pain killer known, including morphine, in the past 8 years. I did n't believe I would ever find any pain relief until my husband found an article about the use of ritalin drugs with people with lupus, fibromyalgia, etc.. I 'm happy to say that after two months, I 'm still doing well pain-wise, although I ca n't take the ritalin at night. For night pain, I still take celebrex (along with several other drugs for my illness). I hope to someday find a pain reliever for night use, but at least my days are much better! Good luck.

This evening, I had a very troubling and new experience. I got out of a bath, and began drying off. This is when my trouble began. First, I felt incredibly dizzy, and I noticed my heart was pounding in my ears. Now it 's strange, because apparently, I staggered out into the hall, fell down, got up, came back into the bathroom and slammed the door behind me... I have very little memory of doing so, though. Then, everything seems too loud- the TV in the distance... everything. I ca n't see because everything is spinning. I tried to put some water on my face, but the tap sounded both garbled and very loud at once, and it did n't work. Finally, I sat on the toilet (I put the cover down) and reclined and closed my eyes and that made it easier... I still was out of sorts, but I realized it and became more aware of it, and lied down on the floor on a towel for a few more moments. Overall, I 'd say this lasted about 3 minutes... it was VERY troubling. I 've never had this happen to me before. But, a few days prior, I had another moment where I was holding a glass, and sort of ``blacked out '' for a minute, and the next thing I remember is the broken glass and spilled water on the table. Really. Could this- these- have been seizures of sorts? I 'm not well read on them. If not, what else could they be? ANY help I can get with this is really, really, heartfelt-ly appreciated. Thanks in advance. PS. I am not an epileptic.######DM, that sounds a bit familiar to me and the seizures I 've had. Epilepsy is n't called the falling sickness for nothing. All sorts of strange happenings could be seizures, though. I 'm sure tumors and heart conditions could lead to similarly strange experiences. Do n't let my comments scare you; I am not a physician or nurse. Just make an appointment with your doctor pronto. There is one more piece of advice I can give you. Get off your feet! If this happens again, sit down, lie down, stay where you are until it passes and you can get help. I think you came to the same conclusion when you were in the bathroom. Finally, a cautionary tale. My seizures last a good deal longer than your experience, but they are partial seizures that do n't involve a loss of consciousness unless I get out of bed and walk around. It took a few seizures for me to learn to simply stay in bed; mine happen almost exclusively in the middle of the night. I did n't see a physician about my condition until after I had had this happen to me several times- seizure while in bed, get up to go to the bathroom, lose consciousness (i.e. progression from a partial to a general seizure), fall and injure myself- get up. The first couple of times I called 911 and went to an emergency room, but they did n't catch it. After that, I simply dealt with it on my own. Big mistake. See a doctor. If they do n't take it seriously or rush to judgement then get a second opinion. If this is epilepsy, it wo n't go away if ignored; it will get worse and more frequent. If you would, please post back here what happens. They will probably want to do an EEG initially. I hope you find an answer soon.######So you think it was a seizure? Or that both were? I just do n't want to go to the doctor for no reason at all.######Well, I ca n't answer that from only forum posts and I 'm not qualified to in any case. Yours sounds like a seizure, but that 's only my opinion. Since seizures happen in the brain they can involve almost any sensory, memory, motor, or emotional states. Mix all those up and you get some pretty unpredictable situations. Add to that the fact that there are non-epileptic seizures which indicate another problem but are n't epilepsy. Last summer I had a seizure after mowing grass all day in 100 degrees, and my neurologist told me it probably had nothing to do with my epilepsy. You can wait to see if anything else happens, but I caution against it. Once you 've brushed off one it becomes easier to make it two or three or more. What is almost certain is that seizures become more numerous and severe if left to themselves. Electrical discharges during seizures find their way through your brain like animals create a path in the woods. After two or more seizures, physicians will tell you that you should have sought their help after the first one, and you can hardly blame them. It 's your call. : call them and ask them to simply note this in your chart in case it happens again. If you go see them the most they will do now is give you an EEG. I wish I could say more definitively. Maybe someone else who has had episodes very closely resembling yours will see this and respond. Better yet, I hope this was a fluke for you and you never have to post here again.######What you described sounds somewhat like the sezs that I have. Things in the room will not look like they are in the right place. I 'll get a dizy feeling. Sometimes I 'll smell things. Things sometimes will be fuzzy. I 'll get really confused. I think I know what 's going on but I 'm not sure. Like what was said before, sit down or lay down. Make sure that you are somewhere that you wo n't fall and hurt your self! My sezs are called focal sezs. I usually wo n't remember what happened during it and they will only last a few minutes. I very rarely have the convolsive type, but that 's one reason that you want to make sure you get somewhere that you wo n't hurt your self. Defently talk to your dr about what 's been going on.######I checked. The 3 minutes was my perception-- in reality, the duration of this was approximately 10-15 minutes. Much longer than it seemed. Also, no one has said anything regarding my ``blackout '' and the spilled drink... and if that might be connected. So if anyone could help me with that one, that would be most appreciated as well. I 'm calling my doctor tomorrow in ref. to all this... probably the best choice..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Epilepsy

From the history provided it seems that you have severe bloating, due to altered digestion and accumulation of intestinal gas. Symptomatic treatment and a few measures will be helpful to relieve your symptoms. Stomach or intestinal gas is a byproduct generated during the process of digestion. It is generally expelled from the body, either through the mouth (called belching or burping) or through the rectum (flatulence or flatus). The best way to prevent this condition is via dietary and lifestyle changes. 1. Eat slowly by chewing the foods properly. This reduces the amount of air ingested while eating & also facilitates carbohydrate digestion. 2. Pay attention to the kind of food you have been eating lately. This would help identify specific foods that cause bad stomach gas and then cut down its consumption. 3. In addition to the above methods, Activated charcoal, probiotics and digestive enzyme supplements can be used for intestinal or stomach gas relief. Activated charcoal tablets have the best effect in relieving your symptoms. But, if the problem persists for a long time, you may consider to consult your physician for an examination and diagnostic tests for digestive and absorption disorders. I hope this helps..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Digestive and Bowel Disorders

I know that there are GERD cases if left untreated over time can cause esophageal cancer so I am not sure if this is something to be concerned about..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Stomach, Ulcers, Gastric Bypass

Another concern could be diabetic gastroparesis. However, this is normally only experienced after a long period of time.

When I get them, I get them so bad that they last for sometimes a good half an hour, also with every hiccup I burp out air. It 's like a hiccup and a burp combined at the same time. Afterwards, Let's say I have a drink or something to eat, I get air in my stomach like normal people do while they eat or drink something. Well, I 'm almost positive that because of the hiccups being mixed with violent burps, something happens inside my throat/chest that will block the air from a burp coming up after the eating or drinking. Basically I have air trapped in my stomach and when I try to burp... it comes up to about the bottom of my neck line/chest area and something stops the burp and sends the air back down to my stomach causing me to want to burp badly to release the trapped air but everytime I want to... I ca n't and it becomes very uncomfortable. Eventually it will go away and back to normal and I will have a huge release of air (finally) with a loud tight burp (almost like whatever is in the way is finally letting some of the air through). I ca n't stand it and it bugs the hell out of me! I read somewhere on the internet a long time ago, how to release air in your stomach when you have a trapped burp (I guess you 'd call it) but I ca n't remember the actual process to get the burp up and I ca n't remember where I read this trick. Do you have any ideas/suggestions; and if known... what is causing this ``caught burp problem '' in my throat/chest area? Thank you for any help with this !!######For how long you have been experiencing this problem? Do you speak a lot while eating? Do you eat with open mouth? Are you overweight? Can you give me some more information about your medical history, other stomach/chest disorders, personal data (age, sex, habits...) etc.. ?######The problem maybe started about 2 years ago I guess (in this particular case or kind of problem). I do n't speak too much while eating, but once and a while maybe (Like the average Joe). I do not eat with my mouth open! I chew normally. I am about 5 ' 11 '' tall, weight is 190, Male age 38, I have no other medical conditions related to my stomach, chest, etc.. . I do have some heartburn quite a bit but thats been since I was in my early- mid 20's, I take Tums and Generic Tagamet once a day. No other disorders. Okay... Other things I did n't mention... I 've recently noticed that it happens mostly on days where I do n't eat all day and then eat a good dinner but maybe because my stomach was empty all day, It sucked or should I say took in a lot of air. I 've also noticed that the Hiccups are so strong along with the hiccup Burping that something in my throat is getting aggravated and is possibly swelling or closing up... so, that may be blocking the air in my stomach after the episode of the hiccup burps ends. It takes quite a while to get the ??? swelling ??? or disruption that 's preventing me from burping afterwards due to the trapped air, to go away. I at one time figured... ``Okay, well, if something is swelling up or getting irritated and closing, it would be obvious to assume that maybe an anti-inflamatory like motrin may make it go away... so I tried that, and it does seem to work (I think, not very sure) but it does take quite a while before the blockage goes away and releases that trapped air, with a big burp or many little burps that sound like they 're squeezing by the blockage with a strong push or forcing the burp by me, sord of! I do smoke, I do n't know if that has anything to do with it but I 'm pretty sure it does not. I do not smoke alot (maybe a pack every two-three days), I 've been smoking off and on for about 15-20 yrs or so. Like I said before, this only happens occasionally when I do n't eat all day. There was one time where it happened and I did eat normally that time, so it kind of made me think that the ``not eating idea '' went out the window. Thank you very much Doc, for responding... You are the only one that did so I thank you !!! Scott R.######Why do you take Tums (calcium carbonate)? It could cause burps as a side effect. Calcium carbonate reacts with the stomach acid and the gas CO2 (carbon dioxide) is released from this chemical reaction. It seems to me that burps are not the only stomach problem you have but acid reflux too. Both problems could be due to persistence of hiatus hernia. You can request testing for Helicobacter Pilory and gastroscopy. Hiatus hernia could provoke hiccups by pressing the diaphragm and also prevents the gases from the stomach to come out. You can consult some gastroenterohepatologist about this.######I suffer from Hicc-burps as my cousin calls them. They started about a year ago. I do n't take any kind of oral medicine nor intramuscular or vein. Just topical for acne. I 'm 19 years old, 5 ' 2 '' and weigh 110. I do n't have any kind of medical conditions of any sort.######i have just been diagnosed with a hiatus hernia and a bacyerial infection in my stomach, i am getting treatment for it but i did not ask my doctor if these problems were cusing my stomach to swell everytimei eat or drink can you confirm this please?######I am 18 5 ' 4 '' and about 120. I recently took some upper GI tests, forexample; a barium swallow. My doctor said there were signs of GERD and I will have further tests done in April to see the damage, but they think a hiatus hernia has caused the acid reflux. But even as I type I am making an odd burping sound that everyone around me describes as a frog croak. My best advice is to drastically change your diet. Avoid greasy foods, caffeine, and acidic foods in general. Also my doctor perscibed me Omeprazole. However, it does n't completely work. Also, I take heartburn relief and malox. I hope this helped!######I too have had the hiccup/burping problem. It started about a year ago as just hiccups, one or two at a time about 20 times a day. Recently in the past month, I started to burp everytime I hiccupped. My primary care doctor had me take a couple different acid reflex medicines but neither one worked. Also, I have been to a GI and had an endoscopy but that did n't find anything.######Hi, I have been getting major bloating and air in m body for the past 6-7 weeks now. It all starts when i eat a meal, i feel overly full although i eat normal portions. Eating then causes me to have constant burps although not complete burps as i feel that air is trapped inside my body. I also feel short of breath and my bowl movement has decreased causing me to put on weight. Today i have had hiccups for the majority of the day on and off and i feel as though i am suffocating from the air that is trapped in my body. Do you have any idea as to what this may be?######help, i have the hicburps a lot in inconvenient times and places, please help, i really want them to stop######I always get hiccups after laughing too much. I also burp a lot and sometimes I ca n't breathe properly. Because of too much burping, my head and hands get numb. I 'm really worried.

I feel that I am healing well, I am able to burp normally and pain is not to much of a issue.I am currently on the full liquid diet. I was just wondering how others transitioned between the liquid to soft diet then to a normal diet? How long? any tips? I know every person is soooo different so it makes things hard to pin point. How long did the healing process take? especially for swelling of the stomach to go down? Anything helps! Oh and by the way I am diabetic as well if that helps! Thank you so much######Hi. Welcome to HealthBoards. I had my fundoplication in 2008. I was on a liquid diet for 2 weeks, then a soft diet for a couple weeks, then I added solids except bread and meat. I waited about 3 months before adding in breads and solid meats. Those two items do n't break down well and are easy to get caught above the wrap if you are n't careful. (Do n't worry if it happens though. Eventually everthing works its way down.) I started adding back soft foods like mashed potatoes and soft mac and cheese early on. Those worked well for me. You will feel much better after a few weeks. I was back to work and doing well after 2 weeks. I was just a bit slower. From what my docs told me, it takes about 8 weeks for the swelling to completely subside in the stomach. If you are concerned about proteins, you could try steaming your ground beef in water which breaks it down fine instead of browning it in chunks. I like mine that way. I did a lot of smoothies for a while after my first week. Those helped me keep my balance. I wish you well..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

To list out the history, I must start with this. I frequently had back pain aroung one and half year ago, but it used to get cured by itself. But on 26/05/04 I had a slipped disc on which was identified by my doctor on physical examination and was later confirmed by the MRI. The exact statment of the MRI is: ``Straightening of the lumbar spine is seen. Degerative Schmora's node phenomenon is seen in the lower dorsal and lumbar region. The intervertebral disc signal is reduced at L1-2 and L2-3 levels on images suggestive of disc dehydration. The upper endplate of L3 vertebral body shows evidence of irregularity and heterogenous signal intensity on T2W images. On T1W images hypointense signal surrounded by hyper to intermediate signal intensity is seen in this region At L1-2 level there is evidence of a well defined left paracentral disc extrusion, which is evidence os superior migration. THis is seen to compress the thecal sac from the left anterior aspect however the neural canal is not compromised. No disc buldge is seen from L2-3 to L5-S1 levels. The central and neural canals bilaterally appear spacious at these levels. MR Myelography reconfirms the above findings. No abnormal pre or para sinal soft tissue signal intensity is seen. The conus and couda display normal MR signals. The facet joints show normal MR appearance bilaterally. IMPRESSION: MR findings reveal a well defined left paracentral disc extrusion at L1-L2 level with its superior migration as descibed above. '' After that I was prescibed 3 weeks of complete bed rest. I took the bed rest for about 2 weeks and then the pain had gone down to a large extent. The numbness and pain in left leg was minor. After this one day again after about 1 & 1/2 months the pain again came up and not the pain & numbness was also there in my left leg, pain was also there in might left buttok and the lower abdomen region on left side. He prescibed me followin medicines and told me not to do any exercises 1. Nerveup 2. Selzic 150 3. Gemcal 4. Celib 200mg 5. Tryptomer When I started these medicines, there was relief in the pain and as well as numbness and strians which were there in my left leg. The somebody prescribed me of HYDROTHERAPY AT Indian spinal injury denter (Vasant Kunj Delhi). I went there for 3 days but the pain has really aggrevated and I 've stopped going there. But now my condition is much more severe. Now I 'm suffering from following problems: 1. Pain in back (aggrevated with sitting) 2. numbness and pain in the left leg. specially in thighs and left fooot (+ fingers). 3. Pain in left buttok (occassionally) 4. Pain in lower abdoman region (on left side) some time strain in testicles also. 5. I feel releived from the pain while walking but the strain in thigh and foot muscles pesists (sometimes). Please guide me though what exactly I should do. Should I take rest again for 1-2 weeks or go for a MRI scan again. I 'm really worried as I 'm the only earning hand and the computer is my only way for that and I ca n't avoid sitting in front of it. Is surgery needed at any stage and how severe my problem is?

About 8 years ago I herniated a disc in my lower back L5-S1. I had surgery to correct this and it worked until we realized I got a staph infection from the surgery. I then had surgery to clean out the infection to turn around and get another staph infection which required another surgery. Since then I have have had so much pain in my lower back and legs. I 've been to numerous pain doctors and neurosurgeons. None have helped. A little over a year ago I started seeing a poison management doctor. So far he has given me injections, medicine such as vision, morphine, sleep aides, etc.. He tells me that I have bone pain and pain due to so much scar tissue from the surgeries. All the surgeries were completed within a month. He recently started nerve burning. He did my lower right back, it was successful. My upper right back was too, as erl as my lower left back. Yesterday her did my upper left back... I 've never been in so much pain. The area where her burnt the nerves is painful but my left hip iss well. I do n't know what to do. The other ones worked so well I 'm just in shock that I 'm having this much pain. Any ideas? Thoughts? Anything?######Sorry to hear about your surgery problems. I also had to have a surgery to clean out an infection after having spine surgery- not fun. Have you had hip pain previous to having the nerve burning? Our ligaments in our hips/SI joint/low back are very interconnected, and once you have problems in one you often develop problems in the other areas. Usually the best thing to do is learn proper core strengthening exercises through physical therapy, and do them for the rest of your life. Regarding being in severe pain, contact your PM doctor. It 's not uncommon to have a flare of pain after having surgery or a procedure, but when it 's severe pain you should always contact your provider for instructions. If you can wait until Monday morning, great, if not then go to your emergency room if the pain is so bad you ca n't take it anymore. If you have a number to call for your PM doctor after hours where they can page him/her, then you might try that also. Best wishes!.######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Back Problems

I can never seem to stretch the muscle and I do n't get relief from muscle relaxers, nsaids, lidocaine patches, and only mild relief with vicodin. I am starting to do phsyioball and core exercises and have noticed that when I contract my glutes the pain is relieved. Sound familiar to anyone? Mike######I see that your post is from last year. Are you better now? I 'm having the same problem and it 's really freaking me out. I think it 's my si joint but my chiro does n't think that 's all. I 'm starting phisical therapy on mon.. But I do n't know if that is going to help. I would love any insight you may have. Christine######i have same problem of lower back pain since 1 year. now am starting phisical therapist for this problem. i am taking bed rest from last 2 mounths. so please any one have sollution of this probleme then please suggest me...######All of you need to be evaluated by a spine specialist, either an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in spines or a neurosurgeon that specializes in spines. Without proper evaluation, MRI done you can not receive the proper care or PT that is needed. Bed rest is one of the worst things you can do with a spine problem. It will stiffen the core muscles and all muscles and make your spine problem worse. Get the proper evaluation and diagnosis so that you can get the help and relief of the pain that you need. Fran######I have had back pain since my teens diagnosed with scoliosis. I am a 40 year old male. It has been so bad that my physician sent me to a pain specialist. I have degenerative dics disease, scoliosis, herniated discs, two buldging discs, etc.. I get epidurals, nerve blockers and cortizone almost once a month. I have a desk job and can not even sit anymore. I am in tears as we spek it is so bad. I am getting ashot today and I look forward to it. I have to get something done quick. I have 3 young boys.######Hi, I have been having lower back pain in my left side when i sit. I tried pain killers, muscle relief creams, Physiotherapy and finally facet joint injection. Nothing worked and i still can not sit. Is there anyone who solved his/her problem? Mett######Hi Mike, Have you solved your back pain problem?######Has anyone found relief yet? Thanks Chris######Nada chair!######Nada Chair works for me!######look in to nada-chair this completely relieves my sitting pain. A miracle. No bs.######I am having the same problem as everyone above. Left sided back pain, they thought it was a kidney stone, ruled that out, then sent me to a gyno and then did an MRI and say I have degenerative changes between L4 & L5 which may be pressing on a nerve, now they are referring me to a pain management specialist. I too have a desk job and am starting my 4th week off of work. I 'm really frustrated. Vicoden helps but not that much. Would love to hear anyones treatment success.######What helped me a lot was the seated abductor press. This exercise both rotates your hips forward and is one of a series of exercises that untwist your hips. 1) Sit on something fairly hard so you can feel your sitbones pressing evenly into the seat. 2) Wrap a strap or belt around your legs just above your knees. Thighs should be parallel and hip-width apart. 3) As you press outwards against the strap, allow your hips to rotate forward, putting an arch in your lower back. 4) Keeping your legs and hips straight press outwards against the strap for up to 5 minutes. You should feel some reaction in your hips.######I had epidural steroid injections on Wednesday. I woke up with no pain this morning for the first time in over a month! There is still a little stiffness but MUCH MUCH better!######I had epidural steroid injections on Wednesday. I woke up with no pain this morning for the first time in over a month! There is still a little stiffness but MUCH MUCH better!######myopracticworks said, ``Sit on something fairly hard so you can feel your sitbones pressing evenly into the seat. '' ???????? After a few minutes of sitting on a thick pillow, it feels like I 'm sitting on a brick! I 've also had the pain on the lower left side of my back when I sit for the past week or two. I used to get the same pain only after walking a while. I have spondylolisthesis and scoliosis, so I think the pain is likely caused by a muscular imbalance. Thank you for the exercise tips, myopracticworks. I hope they help some people here. I 've endured my pain as long as I have because of the exercises I 've been given through the years by chiropractors and PT's which I 've continued doing on my own. However, nothing seems to work any more and the pain just gets more intense- pain and tingling (sometimes burning sensations) in my lower back, buttocks and legs, down to my feet, and sharp pains in my hips. The hip pain has been relieved pretty well by medications including Lortabs (Vicodin + acetaminophen), arthritis-strength acetaminophen, and a salicylate. But, there seems to be no relief for my other pain, so now I 'm looking into surgical procedures (my spondy is now a level 3), which has been recommended by several doctors.######look in to nada-chair this completely relieves my sitting pain. A miracle. No bs.######I too suffer from lower back pain around left lumbar. It feels like a muscle strain, when I have certain movements or jolt really quick I have a sharp shooting pain like a strain, but then turns into a burning pain when sitting down. At the end of the day I can not raise my left leg from a sitting postition to take my shoes off due to the pain it causes me in my back. I have had countless TP injection but once the lydocaine wears off I am back to square one. Does anyone have any ideas. I am sick and tired of the pain killers they just take the edge off.######look in to nada-chair this completely relieves my sitting pain. A miracle. No bs.######hey guys. . i have found something that has taken a lot of the pain away bout not all. I have a herniated L4 L5 disc and for the past 2.5 months have had extreme pain in my lower back and shooting down my leg into my foot. Its 20 times worse when sitting. I found this website that told me to get a bouncy ball and lightly bounce up and down for 5 min (apparently it puts oxygen into your discs to help rejuvenate) I also ice every hour on the hour. I put the ice over my disc with nothing in between the ice and my back (obv for some people they may be too sensitive and it may hurt their skin) and I also use biofreeze a couple of times a day. This has been a god send for me. Im still not perfect, nowhere near it but im not crying anymore lol hope that helps!######Does anybody have back pain only when they sit. I am fit, play daily tennis, cycle and walk many miles per week and enjoy a lively retirement and apart from the odd ache, feel pretty fine. However, after a relatively short time in any sitting position, I find it difficult to move, am in some discomfort and take several minutes to ' unlock '. At the tennis club, I am seen as somewhat of a fraud, as they see me bent double getting from my vehicle, creep into the clubhouse and struggle to put on my socks, only to be beaten as i warm up and chase down everything.######Does anybody have back pain only when they sit.

I can now sit indefinitely with no symptoms. It works by making it impossible to slouch, which makes it impossible for your sciatic nerve to get pinched. I am not affiliated with NADA chair at all. I sat in pain for years till I found it. 100% relief. You could probably make one.######serious about nada chair cant believe no one'!**@! me up######nada chair people######hello, The actual cause for this problem is if u sit on hard surfaces for hours. Also while sitting if you happened to bend on one side and concentrate your body sitting only on some part of your back it may occur. That inflammation can be reduced or eliminated through simple procedure. Put a ``square '' shaped pillow (even surface), i 've tried different pillows but they werent working, so only square shaped even sofa pillow kinda thing and the most important part is you have to put some pillow at the back (either horizontally or vertically though i prefer horizontal since it covers my back evenly)... The main idea is that when your left back is suffering because it doesnt have support (i guess so. . dont know the mechanics but my intuition says so)... So put that beneath. . and lean back...

My back pain symptoms come on whenever I do any physical activity, if I stand or sit in one position too long. I start getting severe pain in my lower back, both right and left. Whenever this happens I try to lay down because it hurts way too much to stay standing or sitting. But whenever I lay down my back starts arching on it 's own, an involuntary movement, and whenever I exhale shooting pain goes through my lower back. It will then take anywhere from a few hours to the rest of the day to stop hurting. I also get pain going down my left buttock, it feels like there is an electrified wire running down to the bottom of my left buttock. This does n't happen very often, and I ca n't figure out why it happens, it just seems really random. I had an MRI done and the results said I had a bulging disc, I ca n't remember where but I know it was in the lower back I think maybe L4-L5, but the doctors ca n't seem to decide if the bulge is causing the pain or not. If anyone has any ideas, or advice it would be greatly appreciated.######``My back pain symptoms come on whenever I do any physical activity, '' This is usually muscle related. Imbalanced muscles pull your back out of alignment and is more obvious when you are moving. This type of pain is usually disc related. '' , if I stand or sit in one position too long. I start getting severe pain in my lower back, both right and left. '' This is usually due to stenosis or narrowing of the spaces between the bones. My friend tore her ACL and with no ligament supporting her knee, she began having trouble standing in one position for long periods of time- like shopping. I get this and can say exactly for sure for me, the ligaments (discs) got loose and torn and could n't hold the bones in place. I do muscle balancing therapy and decompression to get the muscles pulling the back INTO place, not OUT of place. 2 years later, when my back hurts I do the ``Static extension on elbows '' position and the bones in my back make a loud CRACK as they go back into place and the pain goes away. ``But whenever I lay down my back starts arching on it 's own, an involuntary movement '' Your lower back muscles are going into contraction to try to protect the damaged discs. You need to get them to relax. I would suggest ``Static Back ''-- Do a Google search. THEN Do the ``static extension on elbows ''-- Do a Google search. ``also get pain going down my left buttock, it feels like there is an electrified wire running down to the bottom of my left buttock. '' This could be ``Sciatica ''-- Do a Google search. I would suggest ``assisted hip lift ''-- Do a Google search. But your back may be too injured to do this. Sounds like you are really a mess and sorry there is no one quick fix for all you have going on. I hope you will at least give these few a try and see if you can get some relief. Then at least you will know you are on the right track..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Back Pain

I 'm afraid I might have meningitis, however, I do n't know if my symptoms are severe enough or not. I 'm hoping anyone can tell me from experience what it was like at first... when you first suspected it was something serious. My symptoms are as follows: had a fever and chills two days ago, no longer though (can a fever go away with meningitis?) , neck is stiff, but more sore and only on the right side (seems to come more from pain in my shoulder and chest), sharp stomach pains that came after the fever, headache (not bad though), some sensitivity to light (makes headache worse but not too bad, goes away really quick). I feel like my immune system is down and I 'm kind of in and out of a fog. I just feel crumby. Fever and chills have been gone for a couple days though and I 'm more worried about it than how I actually feel. I 'm also having some hearing issues with my right ear, same side my neck, chest and shoulder hurts. I know I do n't want to wait until it 's severe to see a doctor, but would n't I feel worse if I had meningitis?

Like any diagnosis, I am always interested in ALL the possibilities of the causes. Doctors refer to it as a differential diagnosis. You can google ``differential diagnosis, meningitis '' & go through the list of possibilities. The reason I suggest this is that I had severe meningitis 12 years ago where I was bed ridden for over a year. My doctor kept trying to just treat the symptoms & when they did n't go away he said I had fibromyalgia. I finally found a doctor who treated patients with fibro & after tests found I had lyme disease. The co-infection ehrlichia was probably the reason why the meningitis was so severe. Lyme can mimic many other disorders, so it one of the illnesses that should be on your differential list. (Although I must tell you that you will have to have the right lab tests done & most doctors are not aware that the typical tests are not that accurate. Do a little studying on why there is controversy over lyme tests & find a lyme literate doctor & a good lab.) The effects of meningitis can be devastating and sometimes long lasting like mine. I would encourage you to seek a doctor who is compassionate in treating meningitis & pain. A neurologist would be a doctor I would get an opinion from. Keep looking for answers & solutions & never give up. When one doctor ca n't help, or tells you it is all in your head, find another one. You may have to be patient and try many different meds before you find the right combo for you. Best wishes.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

More possibilities below: Idiopathic pancreatitis under age 40 Quote: Extensive or invasive evaluation is usually not recommended in those with a single episode of pancreatitis who are younger than 40 but some reports recommend endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) even after one attack if the cause is not clear to look for pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors at or near the ampulla, microlithiasis in the gallbladder or bile duct, and early chronic pancreatitis. Undiagnosed early chronic pancreatitis may, in fact, be a very common cause of ``idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis ''. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should not be performed after a single episode of acute pancreatitis in the absence of laboratory or imaging evidence of choledocholithiasis. http://www.uptodate.com/ Idiopathic pancreatitis Quote: BACKGROUND In about 20 to 40 percent of cases of acute pancreatitis, no cause can be found, and these are labeled idiopathic. In this study, we sought to determine the frequency with which patients with acute idiopathic pancreatitis have biliary sludge, a suspension of cholesterol monohydrate crystals or calcium bilirubinate granules that is found predominantly in the gallbladder. METHODS Between 1980 and 1988, we prospectively studied 86 patients who had acute pancreatitis. In patients with no known cause of pancreatitis and no ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or dilatation of the biliary ducts, we determined how often biliary sludge was present and its subsequent fate by repeated microscopical examinations of bile samples and abdominal ultrasonography.http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/pubmed/9193774 Anyone have any ideas of what could be going on?

Pain in the mid-upper abdomen, a little below the breastbone that begins about 20 minutes or so after eating greasy food or something with a heavy cream in it. A few times that pain has taken a bit longer, but basically 20-30 minutes. 2. The pain lasts about 1- 2 hours and gets to a moderate level. Not severe enough to impare my ability to do anything I need to do... but fairly uncomfortable. Sort of feels like a giant cramp. After the pain subsides, it subsides to a minor soreness that may last a few more hours and may remain sightly tender (but not generally sore) for a little longer. The TOTAL about of time for ALL the pain has been as long as 20 hours, but other than the first 2, it is just the minor pain and mostly the residual mild tenderness. 3. Until i cut out those foods, the pain could come just about everyday. . but never acute (that 1-2 hour acute time) more that once per day, regardless of what I eat the rest of the day. In fact, sometimes eating again (regardless of what it is) helps the pain go away some more. 4. I have no nausea or vomiting, no jaundice, no back pain. 5. The pain is not dependent on the size of the meal, but whether or not the meal has a grease content of heavy dairy content. I can have a HUGE meal of non-greasy, non-dairy foods with no problem whatsoever. Now that I have cut out greasy foods and raw dairy, I have had only 1 attack in the past week, and I attribute that to a sour-cream based dip I had with some vegatables. . or a huge chunk of fat in a piece of roast beef that I did not realize was there. . although that attack was much less severe than the others. This has been going on for about 1 month. - Ben######It sounds more like a gall bladder pathology than anything, but of course you would need a full clinical workup to be able to know for sure. Sorry for the graphicness, but have you ever had oily, greasy, loose, extremely foul smelling stools before? If yes, that might suggest a pancreatic pathology. Plus, another reason it sounds more like gall bladder pathology is that, with pancreatitis, you would be in constant pain rather than episodic, though the most common causes for acute pancreatitis are alcohol abuse and gallstones. Do either apply to you?######Due to my lactose intolerance and VERY active bowel and some level of IBS I almost always have loose stools. Also, since I have cut most greasy food, raw dairy, and caffeine from my diet, my stools are significantly less frequent and much more well-formed. . albeit I had some constipation at the beginning of my new diet. As for smell. . sometimes they are smellier, but not necessarily a different smell. . although I am not 100% sure if extremely foul would mean a marked definately noticable difference. I am not sure what to look for in terms of oily and greasy stools, but there is no obvious oil or grease. . if anything they have grown harder and drier and more intact for the past week since I have been eating better and putting some more fiber in my diet and the color remains a healthy dark brown. I have not been officially diagnosed with gallstones, but I will be going to the doctor's soon in regard to this problem. As for alcohol... I had about a year or two of a good amount of drinking (getting drunk 1-3 nights/week) about 8 years ago (I am 29 now), but since then I drink very occasionally. - Ben######It could be gallbladder but that usually causes alot of pain if it 's bad. I think you also have a hiatal hernia but you certainly need to be examined.######K.... well, if you had the stools I was talking about (i.e. steatorrhea) you would know. They 're kinda hard to miss######If I am correct in my research. . those stools would be consistent and not sporadic correct? Not that I have had them... but I assume they would be consistent as they signal the pancreas ' inability to produce certain enzymes. Let me ask you. . can a gall bladder also leave some what feels like muscle tenderness over the ribs?######Hi there- I do n't know anything about pancreatitis, but I do know gall bladder disease having lived with it for almost a year before it was removed. As the gall bladder problems increased these were my symptoms (see if they match yours): severe stabbing pain during or within 30 minutes of a meal located up under the right rib cage and radiating to the shoulder blades/mid-back, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and between meals, a dull achy feeling up under the right ribs. My stools were loose or watery and bright yellow or yellowish brown. The symptoms started gradually with only occasional pain/flare-ups after heavy or greasy meals, and then became daily, chronic and caused by any kind of food/liquid intake (even water!) . I ended up going for almost 6 months with severe chronic pain since my hida scans and ultra sounds were considered basically ``normal. '' It took a 2nd opinion for my insurance to agree to surgery, and when the doc removed it, he said it was covered in scar tissue and severely inflamed. You 'll need to see your doctor for a definitive diagnosis and medical testing to determine which organ is affecting you. Good luck and keep us posted, Katie G######Folks, I would have to call myself an expert on Gall Bladder and Pancreatitis considering that I have had surgery to remove the GB and to fight a severe bout with Acute Pancreatitis. My situation was different than most though. I had my Gall Bladder out in early Nov 2003 and 2 months later I had the Panreatitis attack that put me in the hopsital for 12 days. My case required major surgery, tubes and the whole nine yards. Reading Ben's post I would say he almost certainly has a GB problem versus Pancreatitis. Well, between the two, it would be GB I should say. Why you ask? If he had Pancreatitis, he would n't be on this board asking us if he had it. He would be in the hopsital getting treated because the pain is unbelievable! I had a severe case and people do have less severe cases of Acute Pancreatitis that come and go but the symptons are very painful. Ben, I hope it is your GB and not panreatitis but please get it tretaed because if it turns out to be a mild case of Pancreatitis you will want to fix that ASAP or things will get rough. Best of luck !!.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Gallbladder

I am not as physically fit as I used to be but I still swim and play basketball weekly. My diet consist of fatty foods and I hardly drink beer but when I do it 's binge drinking, around 5-6 beers about once or twice a month. I went to ER complaining of stools without any pain at all, so they ran stool test, blood work and ct scan and everything was fine but my lipase levels were EXTREMELY elevated at 1700. They admitted me to hospital for a few days and I responded well to clear liguid diet the first day, I was retested and my lipase next morning was at 1050, still high but a significant reduction. Next morning it jumped to 1130. I was shocked and was upset that the lipase was not going down. All my lipids, liver panels and cbc were normal. GI doc said he 's certain it was acute pancreatitis. He then ordered a 2nd CT scan this time with oral and IV contrast and once again, it was clear but GI doc not did talk to me about results, he sent nurse in to send me home. They sent me home only telling me to lay off alcholol and see him in 2 weeks. Why would any responsabile doctor, especially GI send someone home with a dangerous lipase of 1130? I was shocked again. This still left me with many unanswered questons. Maybe you guys can help me out. 1. I get abdominal pain and sometimes mild diarrhea after drinking moster energy drinks, dairy and iced coffee drinks. Pain always lasted for a less than 5 mins and relieved after bowel movement, I never had pain that persisted for hours. I also associated this brief pain with IBS. No D if I stay away from those trigger foods. Does pancreatitis always create severe abominable pain lasting for more several hours? 2. How can a doctor tell if it 's acute or chronic pancreatitis? Can you have multiple acute attacks or is more than one attack considered chronic? From what I read CP eventually becomes less painful due to failing pancreas and amalyse levels are normal. Since I have no pain, I assume it 's CP and those small bouts of 5 minute pains were pancreatitis flare ups. 3. Anyone have insight of survival rate and lifespan with this condition if treated properly with low fat diet, exercise and abstinence from alcohol? I read it reduces lifepspan 10-20 years for any cp patient. 4. Does chronic marijuana use contribute to pancreatitis? I smoke tons of marijuana and I just switched to edibles after diagnosis, even though GI doc think it has nothing to do with it. Thanks.######-Kidney-Liver-Urinary###-Liver & Pancreas Disorders

I am 23 now. I see that normal symptoms include upper abdominal pain. My pain almost always occurs on my right side, like a big stich, than radiates to my back. It does go away, but returns if I drink. I try to stay away from drinking as much as possible, but cant help it sometimes i.E.. When im with my friends. I 've never experienced vomiting, fever, or have had to been hospitalized. I did go under many tests, and my levels were pretty high. I see that people say they have episodes. My question is what constitues an episode? Like I said I feel the pain everytime I drink, but goes away in a couple of days. I really dont think I can go through life without drinking every now and than. The doctors told me not to drink at all, but have read online that its ok to consume 1 to 2 drinks. My other question is does marijuana have a known affect? I know that smoking cigarettes do, but does that include marijuana? Well, heres to everybody whos had to go through this damn disease, life aint over yall: wink:######Hi, i just wanted to say- be careful! I first developed symptoms at 18, was diagnosed at 25 and i 'm now 32, and i 've had 25 attacks, three within the last three months. It sounds as is your attacks are really mild- you 'll know if you need to go to hospital- because the pain gets way too bad to cope with! I do n't think my ap is linked to alcohol either, but I have cut it out, just to be sure. If you have to drink, I tink you 're better off with `long ' drinks such as wine, beer, etc.. Do n't drink spirits! And, sorry to say, you 've got to stop smoking, completely. It sends all your risk levels through the roof, and you ca n't afford it. You are already at an increased risk of cancer of the pancreas- very deadly, so you have to minimise all the other risks! Above all, do n't mess with this illness. I 've had it for a long time; sometimes it leaves me alone for 18 months, other times it hits again and again, and just takes over. Every time you 're ill your pancreas gets damaged, and you need it to last you the rest of your life. When you see what ap can do to you, it gives you a new appreciation- it can get much, much worse, so play by the rules in order to keep yours as mild as possible for as long as possible. I know it 's boring- having ap when you 're young is a real pain, but treat it with respect! C######thats good advice my son was diagnosed at 16 he is now 23 and been in and out of hospital allot and once in icu whilst on holiday in turkey, he dont touch alcohol and he still gets flare ups its a very scary illness######If you want to ward off pancreatitis, you need to stop drinking completely and smoking also. I have had to deal with pancreatitis for many years now, but more so in the last nine months. I was on a feeding tube for four months, and did n't think I was going to live through the last two attacks. Believe me, you do n't want to do anything that is going to make pancreatitis a part of your life. The quality of my life is not very good at all at the moment, and I would n't wish this on anyone. I have never been a drinker, but I do n't see why you ca n't just order a ``virgin '' when out with your friends......############every time u drink ur amylase and lipase will increase if the food you cosume contains a lot of fat pain may increase.as for ur marijuna aftr consuption u feel hungery and consume more food which might cause pancreatitis.######Hello, drinking with pancreatitis is always a bad idea !! And yes it can be avoided even when out with friends. Become the regular designated driver !! The attacks of pain you have following every time you drink should tell you it is a bad idea... With each acute attack you have, you are one step closer to chronic pancreatitis. And believe me- you do not want to be chronic !! My first attack happened when I was 8 years old (now 48). I have been chronic for the last 6 years. It is life stealer !!! It do n't kill you but it will sometimes make you wish it did. It is disabling (i have not been able to work since 2001). The pain is 24/7 and no matter what you do it never goes away. Yet you also get attacks when the pain is unbearable. Additionally chronic pancreatitis leads to many other disorders- the worse of which is type 1 brittle diabetes- uncontrollable diabetes. This comes with all the side effects of diabetes. Malabsorption is another problem. You can literally starve to death, even though you are eating. It causes all kinds of vitamin and mineral inbalances with come with their own problems. Please think twice before you take another drink. Each drink puts you closer to being chronic... And there are many more problems associated with chronic pancreatitis that I am not listing here. Reeann############Hi all. I 've just had my first attack of Acute Pancreatitis. I was rushed to ER and they gave me morphine, put me on a drip, gave me loads of antibiotics and would n't let me eat. I must admit it was pretty scary- I went in to shock and very nearly died. So I 've just got out of hospital and I do n't know very much about what to do next. The doctors did n't give me any advice except to only eat light meals ?! I see that alcohol is bad- that 's ok can live without that! Can anyone give me any advice? Am I likely to get it again? Thank you... Emma######research and learn to eat, and be devoted to, a non fat diet. I did not say low fat, I said non fat. It is the most important thing and I do n't see it on these posts. Maybe people do n't know how to eat to live with this disease. Please google non fat diets. Work up some recipes you like and stick to them, and carry a tupperware container of these foods with you if you go out. NO ALCHOHOL whatsoever. Do n't even smell it. Put mustard on your sandwich, no cheese no mayo. No egg yolks, buy egg whites in a container and scramble. maybe a slice of non fat cheese on the top. No butter at all, not light butter, nothing of the sort. No birthday cake or pastries, have angel cake instead. Spend a year working on the non fat diet and you will adapt very quickly. Never go off it. this is the way you will live from now on. It takes attention but you will be able to live with it easily once you get the hang of it. Take yours with you, is my advice.############i had an episode of acute pancreatitis about 4 years back. It was intense pain in the lower abdomen radiating to the back.my glucose level was also slightly high. sinnce then i have stopped drinking completely. thereafter i never had any problems whatsoever.my glucose also is normal.but thereafter my calcium level is always low. now i am taking calcium supplements 3 times a day. the absorption is very poor. i also have to take vitamin d. can i now start drinking occasionaly.######My boyfriend has been hospitalized 4 times in the last year for pancreatitis but he continues to drink, now the doctor said this can kill him is that true? He does not seem to get it he thinks that they are just make things up can this kill him if he does not stop drinking ???######I 've had a very serious acute pancreatitis attack 3 days ago... the pain got worse throughout the day and at 1am in the morning I was n't able to take it anymore and asked my husband to bring me to the ER. I stayed in the ER for 6 hours, got an IV, they took my blood, urine samples, and did an ultrasound. It did not take them too long to figure out that I had acute pancreatitis, but they said they can not figure out why- I do n't really drink (maybe once in 4 months ??) and I do n't have gallstones- two of the most common causes for acute pancreatitis. I asked my mother if she had symptoms like that before or if it was in my family, and actually she said she had something like that before, similar pain, but back then they were not able to give her a correct diganosis (40 years ago). I am only 25, and had pain in my stomach before, however, I never took it seriously or it was never that bad that I had to go to the doctor or to the hospital. I have n't had any solid food in 3 days, I am scared to eat because of the pain. I am drinking lots of water and broth, but even decaf tea or chicken broth gives me pain, not too much, but I can tell that it takes time to get better. I got pain reliever like vicodin, which knock me out. I wonder if I can ever go back to my regular diet, I never really cared what I ate before, it was usually a very balanced diet, and sometimes it happened to be a bit fatty/oily. I will have a follow up appmt with my doctor next week and I 'll try to find out more if I have to adjust my diet from now on. Is it normal to feel pain when drinking broth/ tea after acute pancreatitis?######If drink was the cause of your acute pancreatitis, give it up, because when- and it will be when- you develop chronic pancreatitis, you 'll remember all those blase evenings of getting trashed with absolute regret, while being in total agony in the present and unable to think clearly about your fearsomely shortened future. Drink can be fun, until it is n't, and when it 's threatening your wellbeing, just give it up. Seriously. i ca n't put into words the extent to which you 'll rue the day you carry on.######hey guys.... . im 16 yrs old i have had two attacks of acute pancreatitis lol its acyually funny im sitting at mayo clinic now getting a bunch of tests done for this... i was first told i hace this two weeks before my 16 birthday and have since had to make a lot of lifestyle changes... i used to drink about 3 times a month with my buddys but havnt had a drop of alchahol since my first aattack... i also used to smoke cicgarettes (about a pack a day) but quit after my second attack... both times i was put on a low fat diet which is 50 grams of fat per day... for all who dont know that is about 5 tablespoons of mayonase !!!!! i was recently told i could continue a normal diet but have chosen not to... i guess i really dont want to take the risk of getting it again... for 1 it is way painfull... i dont know how many times i blacked out bc of it... and for two i am now repeating a semester of my sophmore yera bc i missed so much school and i just kind of gave up. . plus it really isnt worth the week in the hospital and not eating for three days.... if you ever want to know more or want to ask n e questions you can message me... ttyl guys....######i had ap to. almost died. multiple organ failure followed along with adult respitory distress syndrome. ap usually doesnt go this far but for me it did... my pancreas shot poison into my body. . making my lungs shut down... do i drink now? yes i do... just not as much... i do not expierence stomach pain when i do it though but am always watching for any sign of it, cause then id stop. Life goes on. Doctors will naturally tell you not to do it... but i dont worship that religion and a doctor is not a priest for me as it is for so many others. Listen to your inner most voice. . and it will tell you what you are allowed and what you are not. Pay attention to pain, it is there to warn you and tell you something is not right. I always had warning signs but unfortunately i did not listen to them... i thought drinking more would make the pain go away... and before you judge me... let me say this... im sick of encyclopidia people who believe everything they are told You have a disease... you must be aware of it, but you must live and be merry as well... be the designated drive... ha! some people arent that boring If i sound like a ahole... fine.... but im sick of hearing stupid advice that not based on fact the truth is they dont know where the limit it so they say dont do it at all... i say dont do it at all if you are too stupid to find your limit... but if not, find your limit and listen to your body...... and live and laugh... life is too short to go through it trying to prolong by erasing all the little pleasures... those who want the last years where u pee your bed and cant move... you go ahead and live healthy to die long.... i dont want to die long and im sick of your opra, self help answers######I am writting even though I it may be premature to do so. But I have been devasted by the news at the docs. I have had some discomfort in my right side abdomen just under the edge of my rib cage. I had an ultrasound done and the doc told me I have a cyst in my pancreas... now I am scheduled for a CT scan and I am freaking out of what it might be. The doctor has put a rush on it. . and this has made me even more nervous. I drink but mostly on weekdays, and usually have a beer daily... what is going on ??? I have had heart burn and bloating as well for some time, and many times loose stools. Guess I am looking for good news or something comforting... anyone know what is going on and should I worry ???######A Brief Journey of my pain In January 2010 I experienced my first symptoms of pain which turned out initially to be jaundice followed by a diagnosis of gallstones which meant an admission into hospital in early February 2010. After my first admission eating fatty foods was a key cause of the episodes of pain and was told by the consultant to have my gallbladder out 6 weeks ago but instead gave me 3 months to decide as I was not in a fit state of mind to decide whether I really wanted it so was expected to give him my decision on 13th July this year. I have continued to cut down on fatty foods and have lost almost 3 stones in weight since the beginning of the year, I am not grumbling about the weight loss however I would have preferred to do it differently avoiding pain attacks relating to food intake. I now eat substantially less and better variety of diet along with gentle exercise a few times a week, these pain occurrences have totally changed my life, clothes are loose and although I was t-total before now I will be for the indefinite future as I donâ$ t want food and alcohol relating to further pancreatitis so overall despite the discomfort in hospital I am much healthier and happier. Events superseded my decision to have my gallbladder out late July 2010 so in May this year was admitted again with gallstone induced pancreatitis which was extremely painful resulting a week or so later with my gallbladder removed. I was petrified of the operation but I had it done as I could not bear any more pain so I took the risk of general surgery via key hole. Waiting 8 hours in squelching UK heat was not pleasant especially when you are nil by mouth. On 29th June I was discharged from the consultant only to find a week later I was admitted with a further episode of an infection of the pancreas spending seven nights at the local hospital. Now I hope they have gone for good so when I see the consultant surgeon at the end of August I can try and be discharged for a second time. This time I had severe hiccups, excess sweating and lots of vomiting adding to jaundice, gallstone and acute pancreatitis, why do things in halves, all this when I donâ$ t drink, smoke, eat pretty healthily and have good health yet I have all of this unlucky or what.

Mark Crossley######hello all im 25 years old, i drank wine everyday for the past two years at least a bottle maybe two. i was jus released from the hospital today for pancreatitis. my levels were all off my pancreas was at 10,000 my potassium, and other electrolytes were low. i was in the hospital for 5 days the dr. told me i should not drink anymore as i could possible develop cronic pancreatitis. my question is did anyway experience a bloating around their abdomen or weight gain in that area after being released from the hospital? i was fed thru an iv and given pain pills so i cant understand what the reason would be for the weight gain. thanks in advance######Yes it is very normal to have bloating and gassy feeling when you are released from the hospital and it lasts for weeks until it is finally gone. Your stomach can look and feel huge! I am not sure about the weight gain except I know that the pain killers they give you cause you to be constipated and you need to be on stool softeners most times. I have been in the hospital 8 times with this and struggle to quit drinking but know if I do n't that I will develop chronic pancreatitis which will eventually kill me.######I just got out of the hospital today after four days in there. I was on the IV the whole time and I gained 10 pounds and my stomach is totally bloated still. I did not have any food till this morning, which was some of that hospital egg stuff. It did not hurt after eating it so my doc let me go home. The couple of doctors that I talked to said that I can go back to my regular diet (which consist of meat, dairy and junk, no fruits of vegies) as soon as I felt comfortable. They also told me to stop drinking for two weeks and then I can drink again. I do not drink every day and only have a couple of beers unless it is some sort of weekend away, then I can drink a lot.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago. I was in Tanzania when I got it and was rushed into hospital because the pain was unbearable. After 3 days there I flew back to England and remained in hospital for another 10 days. During my stay I had ultra sound scans, a CT scan, a cannular put in and over 25 blood tests. I wasnt allowed to eat or drink for 5 days. They said they thought it might be the malaria tablets I had been taking- doxycycline, but they couldnt confirm it and wrote down it was idiopathic on my discharge form. Ive been told I can try drinking again after 3 months but I 'm pretty terrified of it coming back- I cant handle that pain again! I think i will drink in the future if I can, just not binge drinking, which my doctor said should be fine.######I 'm 19 and I got my first attack of acute pancreatits a month ago.

I have been a lacto-ovarian vegetarian (I have an occasional egg or slice of cheese, however I prefer soy milk to dairy) for almost 3 years. I have been a complete nonsmoker for almost two years, however, prior to that I did smoke cigarettes, and I have been alcohol-free for almost two years (however, prior to that, I did have an occasional glass of wine or beer). I have been HIV + for almost 18 yrs and asymptomatic. I have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count around 276. I have also been diagnosed over the years with a peptic ulcer (although I believe that this no longer is an issue), hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease bordering on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (confirmed by a liver biopsy), lipoatrophy, osteopenia, and pancreatitis (I have sustained half a dozen attacks, one in particular where I was hospitalized for a month in Mass General). It is believed that all of these conditions have been medication-induced. My concern, however, is the frequency of my pancreatitis. I sustained an attack in November last year and most recently another in March of this year. I have had ultrasounds, and most recently an MRI CP as well as a fecal elastase done and no significant abnormality was found. Recent blood work has indicated that my triglycerides are 377 (nothing compared to what I 've had in the past, however, my last bout in March occurred when I had only 600 and something), my lipase is 456 and amylase is 101. As an aside, my glucose has been fluctuating around 125 for a while and my liver functions are AST 165 and ALT 226. Despite being told that my current medications do not aggravate the pancreas, I have my doubts (since my HIV medications have always been the culprit of my physical demise). Isentress (raltegravir) 400 mg tablet BID Emtriva (emtricitabine) 200 mg capsules QHS Sustiva (efavirenz) 600 mg tablet QHS Tricor (fenofibrate) 48 mg tablet QHS Xyzal (levocetirizine dihyrochloride) 5 mg tablet QHS Boniva (abandonee sodium) 150 mg tablet once a month Loperamide Hydrochloride tablets PRN Rozerem (ramelteon) 8 mg tablet PRN Butal-APAP-325 CAFF TAB MIK (substituted for Fioricet) PRN Zovirax (acyclovir cream) 5 mg PRN It has been suggested that perhaps these bouts of pancreatitis are simply idiopathic, or that I have some sort of autoimmune pancreatitis. I was also informed that I could have an endoscopic pancreatic function test done in order to further pursue this problem. Is there anything that I or rather we-- me and my team of medical doctors-- should be doing? Or should I simply resign myself to be like Beckett's characters in his play and wait not for Godot, but for pancreatitis?######There are many cases of acute pancreatitis, being a first manifestation of primary HIV infection. This is explained as a result of the infection itself (they were just diagnosed and without antiviral treatment). Also, some infections that are common in HIV positive patients, could lead to an attack of pancreatitis (ex. mycobacterium avium). As you said, medication-induced pancreatitis is common appearance in HIV patients. Having a history of high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides is a risk factor for pancreatitis. It is good to know that sometimes even a single attack of pancreatitis can lead to a chronic one, despite the cause of the initial attack. Eating four or five meals a day consisting of food low in fat may help reduce the frequency and intensity of the flare-ups. Blood tests for elevated pancreatic enzymes and insulin can be elevated in patients with chronic pancreatitis, but, they are n't so useful in confirming the diagnosis. An MRI scan, CT scan, or endoscopic study, for correct diagnosis and for finding certain complications, are the best diagnostic choice. These imaging techniques are also recommended because of the greater risk, chronic pancreatitic patients have for developing a pancreatic cancer.

I 'm totally not the typical pancreatitis patient- female, thin, fit, good diet, minimal alcohol consumption, no visible gall bladder stones on ultrasound... I had the pancreatitis for 5 days before taking myself to hospital. In those 5 days I saw two different GPs. One told me that I had a broken rib (never really bought that theory!) and the other thought it was a gastro of some sort. They could n't feel anything when they pushed on my stomach and I was n't vomiting so I guess I was n't presenting typically. Anyhow, 2-3 days on a drip in hospital with no food did the trick and I 've been okay since then... until now... So for the last 3 days I 've had a very similar pain. Same place, waking me up during the night as the previous attack did and worsens with deep breathing as per the last occasion also. I 'm not vomiting though I feel nauseas. It 's somewhat less intense though. I went to the doctor this morning who thinks I might have chronic pancreatitis. The pain is directly over the pancreas but he thinks I 'm not presenting with anything that seems acute. I was surprised and kind of upset to think I might have a chronic condition. He 's ordered blood work (eg. lipase, amylase etc). But my question is: will the bloodwork be able to distinguish between an acute case and chronic? Last time my lipase was 1700 (vs 60 normal). If my lipase is elevated again this time, will it be clearly an acute case, or is lipase also elevated in chronic pancreatitis. I 'm just worried that I need to be in hospital on a drip and if chronic pancreatitis is assumed then I wo n't get the treatment that I need to get over this? Any input is appreciated! Thanks!############I, too, have all the same symptoms, just had A ERCP done last week. Still so sick and hurting. They cut the bile duct open because it was closed. Not sure what will happen, but from all I have read, it seems we are in for a terribly painful miserible life. They seem to take baby steps with this, and do not promise any good results. I have Chronic Pancreatitis with stage 1 and 2 liver damage. Never drank a lot either. I definitly feel your pain. My husband died of Pancreatic Cancer 15 years ago. oh, and the depression is worse, of course. Wishing you luck Ann######Hang in there!######Oh gosh, Ann, that sounds terrible. I hope you feel better after your bile duct has been opened. The doctor just called me with my blood test results: Amylase: 291 (normal < 100) Lipase: 530 (normal < 60) So my pain is definitely due to my pancreas. I am not sure whether to go to hospital to go on an IV. The pain is stopping me from moving and doing anything, but I 'm not vomiting or anything like that. Are enzyme levels like mine more likely to indicate a chronic condition or just a second bout of acute pancreatitis? Also, my stools are floating at the moment. Can that happen from acute pancreatitis or only chronic?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

He was in the hospital for over a month and had many complications due to the pancreatitis. He has been hospitalized 9 times in the past year with pancreatic pain and his lipase levels have been very high, along with high liver enzymes. He was finally sent to the University of Minnesota where they did an ERCP to put a stent in his pancreatic duct. Because the pancreatic duct was more difficult to get to and because his liver test have always been high, the doctor decided to cut the bile duct and see if that will help. He is home now... the ERCP was done 5 days ago... and he is feeling fine. He has a little abdominal soreness. Check with your doctor to see what dietary supplements you need to take, you should be on a digestive enzyme to help digest fats, and a low fat diet is a must after pancreatitis..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Pancreas Disorders

Basically what she said was that it acts as a natural stomach coater, it also helps with digestion and heartburn (and inflammed muscles for those who have nasty chest and back pains) to ease that icky burning up the esophagus. If you 're going to try it, make sureee and i ca n't stress it enough that it 's Deglycyrrhizinated licorice, because if it 's glycyrrhizinated then it may give u high blood pressure. So far it seems to relax my GERD quite a bit, it may not be a complete solution to medication but it 's worth a try. Anyway, take care.######Yes, licorice is good medicine. So is ginger, by the way.######It helped me a lot.######Another great natural cure is apples and similarly, apple cider vinegar. The great thing about apples is they 're inexpensive, available at every corner market and they do wonders for your overall health. Like the saying goes, ``an apple a day keeps the doctor away. ''######Aw thank you a ton for this information, I hate having acid reflux. I love orange juice and anything sadly acidic based and its just a nasty feeling to have im real glad ive found out that these things can take it down.######Probiotics is also a great natural way to help acid reflux. It also helps other things like your digestive system and stuff. You can buy them at herb and vitamin stores.######next time you have heartburn, drink the freshly squeezed juice of one lemon. it 's an instant cure. just do n't add sugar or anything otherwise the results are different######DGL works great for many stomach problems including reflux, however, it works differently than how the OP describes. Here is a link to a good description: http://www.ehow.com/way_5523047_dgl-work-c ure-acid-reflux. html I used DGL for several weeks while fighting GERD; it is much better than any standard OTC med, with few if any side effects. Oddly, I had one, probably the only person ever, but when I took it at the full recommended dosage before every meal, it cut back on my sleep. After I figured this out, I started cutting the pills in half and that cured the sleeping problem and DGL still took care of the stomach.

Studies show that more than 60 million Americans are currently treated by their doctor for acid reflux. Last year there were 470,000 hospitalizations and 1.9 million emergency room visits caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly called acid reflux. Moreover, GERD is being diagnosed in children from birth to four years. My e-book, Acid Reflux: The national epidemic, and the predecessor of chronic diseases that pull back the curtain to reveal the truth about the evil, because we are all chronically ill, with the exception of GERD, but a variety of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, allergies, dementia, including autism, see Healing Diet Acid reflux disease Much of what we are developing on good nutrition today, and faulty research funded farms Goliath.

If the Food Pyramid is not the answer, what is? In Acid Reflux: The national epidemic, and the predecessor of chronic Let me explain how our body actually works to digest and absorb the food we eat. Before the 1950 most of our food comes from small family farms. These foods were high quality animals eat their natural diet. The cows ate grass, chickens ate insects and worms, and all fish were caught in the wild. These are rich in nutrients that our body needs for optimal health and digestion, but unfortunately this is not what we find in our grocery stores today. Note the number of ads are for drugs to treat chronic conditions like acid reflux, gas, indigestion, constipation and diarrhea. Pharmaceutical companies hope to win a whopping$ 400 million in annual sales counter to check the ``little purple pill. The remedy for acid reflux is just a slow death. Current information on so-called healthy food does not cure digestive problems and eventually lead to nutrient deficiencies, disease and even death, it behooves us to learn the difference. The principles of a healthy diet really is only one aspect in this unusual ebook.

When something like this sticks around for a long time, you want answers, and you want to feel better. As you should.

It 's hard to say if the new doctor will confuse you, it really depends on what they say. If you feel like seeing another neuro-otologist, I 'd go.

Are they real or just nonsense?.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia######I had a neuroligist tell me the trigger points are a bunch of nonsense. Some doctor did biopsies on the tissue from several trigger points on a patient who had a Fibro flareup and found nothing. No evidence of inflammation or any other abnormalities. He also said what if you get a doctor who presses harder on these pressure points than another doctor? Press hard enough on any part of the body and it will hurt. I have severe Fibro and I never have found my so called pressure points to be any indicator of any kind or do they hurt more or less when I get a flare up.######Hi RSTARRE, I believe you are right. I have fibromyalgia pretty bad and I do n't have most of the so called trigger points, I have a couple in my shoulders and neck. Mostly I just have overall pain, the worst is my neck and shoulders that cause headaches. Lately I am getting pain in my right knee. I was getting the burning sensation in my feet, but since taking Lyrica and Cymbalta, that has gone away. I can barely walk when I get up in the mornings, can hardly make it down the stairs, but that goes away after about an hour. Anyway, before I go on about my problems, let me get back to the original topic, I think we are all different and some may have trigger points, and yes, if you press very hard on some it will hurt, but not all of us have trigger points and have fibro pretty bad. Sunny######Trigger point injections are helpful. Ignore your neurologist- he 's not the cat's meow for fibro sufferers. Blessings, Kirstee######Do n't confuse tender points and trigger points. They are not the same thing.######Well I have them and you do n't have to press hard at all to send me into extreme pain, So I 'm going with NO they are not nonsense at all.######ofcourse they are for real. Get a book or look up information on line. It is not fibromyalgia. Trigger points are caused by myofascial pain syndrome or chronic myofascial pain and this a chronic condition, meaning that it never goes away completely. Many people with fibromyalgia have cmp. If you have untreated trigger points, they will eventually form chains down your body as one muscle covers for another. It is a muscle that wo n't release on it 's own. As someone else already said, tender points are a fibromyalgia symptom and the tender point exam is used as way to diagnose fibromyalgia. I personally had 11 on my first exam. I can not find them on my own except for around my collerbone. I recommend the book, ``Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain, A Survival Manual '' by Devin Starlanyl. It covers everything about both conditions and also fibromyalgia coexisting conditions, mind body connection, disability issues, and a whole chapter on fibro fog. I hope you check it out. You really need to be knowledgable about your illness so that you are able to manage your healthcare and be your own advocate. Good luck.######I found out the hard way that I do indeed have some of these trigger points. I tried to find some of them a while back and did manage to locate the ones on the inside of my elbows. . knew instantly when I did find it !! Wow, very tender. . but what really bothered me most about it was that for nearly two days afterwards, my whole arm ached something awful. Wanted to see if that was just a coincidence, so I located the one on my knee. . same reaction. I will leave it to the doc I see in April, and hope I 've got a good supply of pain pills when I get that nasty exam. Are they real? Well I sure think so!######I believe trigger points are quite real. I also do not think there is any difference between a myofascial trigger point and a FM tender point. The biopsies mentioned by the neurologist were likely only looking for pathological conditions of the muscle. However, I believe much of the confusion will eventually go away when researchers focus more on the skin as the location of tender and trigger points. There has been a good number of repeatable findings in recent research of microcircular abnormalities and unusual neural behavior in the skin at these sore spots. Further, if one has enough of these sore spots, he will soon realize that they occur as well in places where there are plainly no muscles. Finally, all manual therapies designed to treat the muscles in fact more directly treat the skin. Bad muscle behavior is only a reaction to the errant processes in the overlying skin. We should ask ourselves why we assume the pain is in muscles when we palpatate a spot. Skin feels everything, muscles feel almost nothing.######from my personal experience, they 're very real. why else would pressing on a lump at my knee or hip produce pain and electrical sensations right down my leg to the top of my foot? and why would continuing to massage that lump cause these sensations to gradually reduce, and the muscles in between to be left more relaxed than they were before i started? if your neurologist has any alternative explanations (other than it all being in my head) please let me know!######Remember this diagnosis is a fairly new one and I 'm not so sure they have it all figured out yet. I believe there are different levels for different people and if you have ever looked at all the symptoms that could be involved you might as well throw in the kitchen sink. Then you have half the physicians out there that absolutely do not believe this is a true diagnosis however, they also ca n't explain the symptoms under any other diagnosis. I have some symptoms but not all I just know my body hurts 24/7 so I take my Ultram and get on with my day and try not to dwell on it. It does n't stop all the pain but makes doing stuff tolerable.######My personal opinion, tender points are real and so are trigger points. I have all the tender points and I am sure the knots in some of my muscles would be considered trigger points. About this muscle biopsy thing. Here in St. Louis we have one of the worlds leading pathologists for muscle tissue at Washington U. School of Medicine. My husband was very ill with what they suspected but could not prove was a rare muscle disease and the only way to finally get answers was to do major surgery to take a piece of muscle out of his shoulder and have the leading muscle guy check it out. It took months to get an answer and by then his disease had progressed enough they did n't need the biopsy which came back conclusive ENOUGH. In other words muscle biopsies are not the end all to be all. The trauma of surgery to his body and the almost 3in scar was not worth what they found out. This is just my opinion of course and I 'm the one with fibro not the nuerologist. Glojer######To all the newly diagnosed and uninformed: Tender points and trigger points are not the same thing. It is so important to understand this syndrome of conditions that we call fms or fibromyalgia syndrome. And to also understand what chronic myofascial pain (CMP) also called myofascial pain syndrome. Tender points are a symptom of fms. Trigger points are a very real symptom of cmp. it is what cmp is all about. If you do n't understand these syndromes, I urge you to read ``Fibromyalgia and Chronic Myofascial Pain, A survival manual. '' by Devin Starlanyl. Order it from your library if you ca n't buy it. And read other books too. The internet is full of misinformation and money making schemes. You owe it to yourself to be educated. << <removed> >> >. So if you are newly diagnosed, keep an open mind and learn as much as you can. Then you can help others, which is why we are on this planet in the first place. You can not give away what you do n't have. With much love, A_Starr######With respect, Ms. Starlanyl is the primary mover in the notion of a difference between trigger points and tender points. The difference is mostly of a religious nature. There is a multitude of doctors in the field who will argue that there is no substantive difference- and that CMP and FMS are just on different positions of the same disease spectrum. Let 's also not forget that, although a good advocate for our condition, she is in the business of making money from it.######Trigger points and tender points are not the same thing..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

Then my Vitamin D levels were tested and I was told my level was 10 and that I 'm very deficient.

Good luck!######CaliLuV87, The cause of fibromyalgia is still not known. There has been some research to suggest that the vitamin D pathways may be affected in fibromyalgia. However, putting fibromyalgia aside for the moment, you do have a significant problem with the vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is one of the fat soluble vitamins (vitamins D, E, A, and K) which is created by sun exposure. It is sometimes called the sunshine vitamin because it is created in the body when it is exposed to sunlight. A twenty minute exposure on the face is usually enough for someone to get his/her full daily requirement. Many foods are now fortified with vitamin D, such as milk and bread. However, if you are a vegetarian you should know that this type of diet can be low in vitamin D because it is commonly found in foods such as egg yolk, fish, fish oil, some cheese, beef liver and some types of grain. Vitamin D deficiency symptoms include depression, chronic fatigue, weight loss, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, osteomalacia, bone pain, and muscle weakness. Vitamin D is very important, because its role is to help your body use the calcium and phosphorus from your food. It also regulates normal cellular differentiation thus helping to prevent cancer and helps insulin secretion. Deficiency of this vitamin is related to rickets. This is a disease which affects your bones. They donâ$ t form properly because the calcium can not be incorporated into them. So your bones lack minerals and that makes them fragile. This can cause serious skeletal deformities. Causes of vitamin D deficiency can be different. Here are some of them: (1) The recommended doses of this vitamin is not consumed. (2) Limited exposure to sunlight. (3) The kidneys can not change vitamin D into its active form. This can develop with age. (4) Being significantly overweight. Vitamin D is absorbed by fat cells which can lead to low levels of vitamin D in your body. (5) If you have dark skin, the melanin reduces the skinâ$ s ability to produce vitamin D. (6) Having a genetic metabolic deficiency that interferes somewhere in the complex vitamin D pathway. So, it is conceivable that your periodic musculoskeletal pain may be from your vitamin D deficiency. As your levels drop you have symptoms and when they are normal, you feel okay. However, this is something that you should really discuss with your physicians and other health care providers. Hope you get a handle on your situation. Good luck.############Wow, thanks everyone. I know I 'm a little late in my reply, I rarely go online. I was given a prescription for vitamin d pills that I was taking once a week for 8 weeks. I finished the pills sometime in March, but have n't gone back to check my levels yet. I will soon, though. I 've also been taking Viactiv for women which are loaded with calcium and all sorts of vitamins. There has n't been any pain for months and I 'm feeling great!######Some of the most generally accessible sources of vitamin D is certainly sun's rays. Whenever sun rays arrive at the skin, formation of vitamin D will start in the body system. Besides contact with the sun, alternative methods to acquire vitamin D is actually crystal clear- food. A lot of people believe that having food resources for vitamin D is not required given that sunshine is well attainable and merely 15 -20 minutes of get in touch with the sunshine is sufficient stay away from vitamin D deficiency. Nonetheless, the modern stressful life-style which require unpredictable job timings provide us very little time for sunshine subjection. Not surprising, vitamin D insufficiency is typical in the town people. Inappropriate vitamin D concentrations could make the bone fragments fragile as well as maximize the chance of weakening of bones. Most of these medical problems could be prevented simply by incorporating food resources of vitamin D during the eating plan. A few of the food items loaded with vitamin D are actually mentioned directly below: Excellent Food Sources of Vitamin D Fish Merely a couple of kinds of fish are discovered to have significant amount of vitamin D. Fish for example tuna, large mackerel, wild salmon as well as sardines are actually loaded with vitamin D. These kinds of oily fish and also defined as food items high in vitamin D. In regards to maximum vitamin D quantities within fish, wild salmon is definitely a guaranteed safe bet. http://www.vitaminddeficiencysymptomsguide. com/.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Fibromyalgia

I do know of cases where a person can have both conditions, however I do n't know how common this is and I do n't know if there 's a connection between the two via an autoimmune component. I do know that MS does not affect the peripheral nerves, however the same problem within the immune system that causes diseases such as MS is also known to cause a peripheral neuropathy.######I typed in my symptoms on a search engine, and ms came up. I have had a loss of vision in my left eye, ever so slight in the left quadrant (I noticed it when I was driving). I have muscle pain, and I have some tingling in the extremities. I run, swim, bike and teach/compete in jiu jitsu so the muscle pain is normal, but the slight numbness in the hands and feet is a bit unnerving. I am going to have an emg soon. I 'll let you know the results. Peace out######Can you be more specific? I was told by my doctor that I do have peripheral neuropathy. No real problem with the nerves in my leg and arms themselves, but because of the demyelination in my brain the signals are not getting through the way they should, thereby causing peripheral neuropathy. Are you looking for something else that can cause the same symptoms as MS? HTLV 1, Celiac disease and the associated DH, Lyme, etc.. There are several immune system disorders that you can have along with a diagnosis of MS that can cause peripheral neuropathy. I 'm just not sure what it is you 're asking. Sue######Sue: You provided some direction for me. I wanted to know if MS can actually cause a peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy appearance on exam. I have spent the better part of a year with a neurologist who created more questions than answers. I have all the symptoms of MS, all other conditions have been ruled out, with the exception of a peripheral neuropathy. I am a borderline diabetic and naturally this is suspect in the eyes of the doctors. I have had two EMG/NCV in the past year. The first was perfectly normal, the second, six months later, slightly different from the first, but basically inconclusive. The neurologist suggested that I see an Endocronologist for a better evaluation of my diabetes. The Endocronoligist tells me that my symptoms are not consistent with a diabetic peripheral neuropathy. That was my belief all along, based on extensive research into the condition. I have an appointment with a neurologist who specializes in MS and is part of an MS clinic at a major Chicago hospital. I have read that a neurologist who follows only a handful of MS patients lacks the experienced to accurately diagnose and treat the condition. I am told that one needs to find a doctor well exposed and experienced with MS patients and who is affilated with an acedemic hospital. This is my next step in early November. Did you have an EMG/NCV that revelaed a peripheral neuropathy?######Hey Wirenut8, I 'm in your general area (south suburbs). I 'd be interested in talking to you via telephone if that 's possible.

I have always had feet that would get sore after a few hours of standing/walking. But now I have a new symptom. I go to Disneyland often and after about 2 hours, my toes (and sometimes the sides of my feet) have this horrible burning pain. I was told it could be from shoes that are too loose, and it 's friction. But it 's happening no matter which shoes I wear, I also bought some Thorlo socks, did n't help. It 's so bad at times, I have to leave early Any ideas to help? Thanks######Could be neuroma's. These are nerves thar are inflamed and get aggravated when doing activities such as walking. You can try OTC orthodics such as Superfeet to see if they help. If not you will probably have to see a podiatrist to get fitted for custom ones.######You can try OTC orthodics such as Superfeet to see if they help. >> > I have orthotics from the Good Feet store... I am wondering if maybe wearing an open toed shoe would help?######Hi again... I did a search on the neuroma. I have connective tissue disease and possibly lupus, I have other feelings of neuropathy in my legs etc, I wonder if this is tied in?######I 'm not sure, for me, nothing really helps except to cool my feet off with cold water. I have a couple of problems with my feet, including neuromas and Fasciitis. I think Lupus can give you all sorts of strange sensations, although it 's best to probably go to your GP.######That burning pain was the first symptom I got, before I realized what I had. I 'm sitting in a wheelchair now. Visit the Neuropathy board to see if anything there is similar to what you 're experiencing. You really need to go see your family doctor. Tell him/her your symptoms and ask for a referal to see a Neurologist. The sooner you get diagnosed the better. Have you ever had your blood sugar tested? Is it possible that you 're a diabetic? Peripheral Neuropathy starts out, just like you 're describing. Not trying to scare you, Just trying to help. Good luck.######Burning usually means nerves######If you 're not diabetic I doubt it 's Neurapathy (intentially misspelled, to prevent hyperlinking ads). Neurapathy usually means tingling, numbness and burning and usually takes years to develop and is usually seen in diabetics. You could have TTS or some other kind of nerve entrapment.######Hi. I have burning in my feet, too, but it does n't last long. I have diabetes and circulation problems. Is it possible you could have one of these two conditions and not know it?######It definitely sounds like small fiber neuropathy. The burning pain on the side of your foot does NOT sound like a neuroma. Look it up for yourself to be sure. You do n't have to be diabetic to have neuropathy. Neuropathy has hundreds of causes. For example, diabetes, alcoholism, B12 deficiency (a high suspect), celiac disease, and many more I ca n't think of right now.

I have been to the doctor 4 times, x-rays were taking and blood work was done, he said it does n't seem to be CTS but something in my blood showed up positive that he said could be some type of rheumatic type arthritis. But he said he doubts it is that because I do not have any pain or problems anywhere else and no family history or anything like this. I was referred to a rheumatologist but the earliest appointment I could get is December 2nd and my wrist (especially my right wrist) is getting really bad. I can hardly write or do my job, which is working at the post office sorting and delivering mail 2 days a week under a contract so I am considered self employed so I ca n't just go out on workmen s comp or anything like that until this is fixed. So far there is sharp pain that is all right at my wrist joint (More intense when pressure is appliailed or pulling and bending, pretty much doing anything like carrying a plate or writing with a pen) and I can feel stress on the muscles in all my figures all the way down my forearm muscles (not really a bad pain but sore like if you had been working out and got your muscles worn out). Does anyone have any ideas what this could be like? Even a long shot, I would like to know all the ``possibilities '' so I can look into each more closer to see if the symptoms match mine more. I am in the process of trying to find another rheumatic doctor that I can see quicker but I might end up having to wait another month. . Any thoughts on what this might be are very welcomed, thank you.######You could have arthritis in the wrist joint, it can still be cts, could also be radial nerve inflamation. You may have stress your joints some time ago and the ligaments or tendons are inflamed. You can also have a form of gout, any joint can get gout it just more prevalent in the toes. Rhuematoid arthritis is another possibility. I have RA and osteo both in the hands and wrists and sometimes it is impossible to even lift a cup. Those are my ideas but i ``m sure the rhuemy will put you through some tests. You can also have cubital problems in the elbow that is radiating into the forearm and wrist.######Thank you for the reply I will look into these.######How do your wrists feel when you first get up in the morning? I have RA and my wrists hurt a lot. One thing I 've noticed with RA is that while the joint may hurt all day, it hurts worse when I first get up or when I first move a joint after it I have n't moved it for awhile.######It could always be carpal tunnel if your typing/using it alot. I have it, and i 'm fourteen. I 'm usually typing alot (Really, alot) and it started hurting about a year ago. It hurts mainly in my wrist area. I hope I helped a bit, but i 'm not too intelligent yet. I hope it feels better soon, Euclid######They hurt about the same, does n't matter if they have been still all night or been slightly moving around constant, another reason I do n't think it is artritis, but who knows...######It could be tendonitis.######Lots of things can go wrong with wrists. I have DeQuervain's Tendinitis. Which gets very painful. When it 's at it 's worst it makes the wrist and thumb and arm above the wrist as well as the palm BURN with pain and gets so weak I can not hold onto anything. oh well, heres a link the US library of Medicine's input on it. . (url) http://search.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/query?MAX=500&SERVER1=server1&SERVER2=se rver2 & PARAMETER = DeQuervain% 27s & DISAMBIGU ATION = true & FUNCTION = search & x = 66 & y = 7 (/ url) I 'm not so good at putting a URL here. . maybe you could just copy paste it? That is one wrist problem that does not show up in X-rays or a blood test. My Dr sent me to a wrist specialist who had me make a fist and tell him where the pain radiated from when he pressed. My wrist specialist gave me the choice of surgery or physical therapy for it. I chose the therapy. All they did was give me a removable hard cast to wear for 6 weeks. This cast forced my thumb way away from my hand and it was painful but somehow a relieveing pain. . After 6 weeks my wrist was good as new. It does return and when it does I simply sleep in a thumb brace for a couple nights and that takes good care of it wonderfully. I 'm glad I did not choose the surgery because the therapist told me that even after surgery it usually comes back anyway. I hope you get your problem solved soon.

Essentially the disease is Avascular Necrosis, and what happens is the Lunate in the wrist loses blood supply due to having only one blood vessel and basically dies. My only option now is total wrist fusion. So, has anyone ever had a total wrist fusion and if so what is the recovery time? Even if you have n't had a wrist fusion all answers are appreciated and welcome. Thanks######I too was just recently diagnosed with Keinbock's disease in my dominant wrist. I have to have a basal CMC joint arthroplasty soon in the same hand. The Dr. told me that he ca n't fix both problems at once. Has anyone else been in this situation?######Hi i have had Kienbocks Disease for over two years and i had total wrist fusion 5 weeks ago on my left hand the Surgeon ended up taking all the bone out of my hand as it was so bad i can not tell you how long the recovery time will be as its only been 5 weeks but at the end of the day i should be out of pain well i hope so i will be in a cast for around 8 weeks i go back next week to see the Surgeon and i think he will take a x ray then and see how things are going if you like i will keep you posted or if you need to know anything just let me know Mike######Hi, I too have had the total wrist fusion due to Kienbock `s. I had surgery only on the 17th December 2011, three weeks ago, and so far so good. Basically, as you mentioned, there is very little the consultants will do fro KD in the late stages. I decided that due to the pain, and also that I just wanted to get on with my life, I am 42 by the way, That the total fusion was best for me. The operation took nearly three hours, taking bone graft from my side, and placing the bone into where the lunate had collapsed. My side hurt more than my wrist, but three weeks post op, I am feeling stronger each day, and I have also cut back on the painkillers. I have asked about possible alternatives for fusion, however, it looks like any op apart from the full fusion would require another op somewhere further down the line, but everyone is slightly different I suppose. I was STAGE 4 so my wrist was like mush.######I apologize for not getting back to all of you sooner, my comp died. I hope you all enjoyed the holidays. I too am stage 4 and am still considereing the surgery. I appreciate all of your responses and look forward to any updates going further.

I was diagnosed with Kienbocks (left wrist) back in 1981. Had the Swanson procedure (silicone implant) to remedy the problem. I am thankful that I got 30 years out of it, but xrays show the implant has broken down, wrist is shot. Since the original procedure, I have catered to my right wrist over the years I know have ligament/tendon damage in my right wrist. Kind of at a loss right now. Need surgery on both wrists. They are saying they have to go in my left wrist to remove all of the bad bone and particles. Looking like wrist fusion at a minimum. Extremely nervous about the procedure or confused on what wrist to do first. I 'm left handed and ca n't really afford to be out of work for any length of time. I do n't really do physical work (work on computers). Any thoughts on how quick I could get back to work? Any thoughts, suggestions are appreciated.######Hi well its been 11 week post total wrist fusion still have a bit of pain but nothing like i had got some movment in my fingers but told it could take a year to get good movment i think you could get back on a computer after about 8 to 10 weeks if you have it done all i can say is as soon as you can start to move you fingers i know you will be in a cast for 8 weeks well i was anyway i hope things work out for you and try not to be nervous my friend it will be ok######Hi there, how is your hand/wrist now? I had the same surgery for Kienbocks in my right hand and am about 3 weeks post surgery and can move my fingers fine but a bit sore.######I was diagnosed with keinbocks over 10 years ago. I have had a partial wrist fusion. The took a tendon from my arm and anchovies it up in place of my luniate bone. About 5 years ago I had to have the orthopod go back in to remove scar tissue and bone spurs. I now have to go back in and fix my thumbside because my thumb is no longer in it 's socket.

About 4-5 months ago I hurt my left wrist lifting weights (I believe doing dumbell shrugs). The pain was pretty minimal, so over the next couple of weeks I continued my normal exercise routines (I generally do a ``high intensity '' routine of 3 sets and 4-6 reps, focusing on 1-2 body parts per workout). Over this couple of weeks, the pain in my left wrist got worse and worse (the exercises that were giving me the most problems with my wrist were shoulder shrug and dumbell/barbell curl exercises) and I eventually took a break from working out on my left wrist. There was no pain at all when my wrist was stationary- but there was a little bit of pain when I move the wrist around a lot (particularly when I try to stretch it back) and a lot of pain when I lift using heavy weights. After taking a few weeks of break from working out on my wrist, I went back to my normal exercise routine and gradually, with each workout, the pain in my wrist quickly resurfaced to the level it was at before I took a break. After a few months of cycling between taking a couple of weeks break from working out on my wrist and going back to try it again I am still at the same point where my wrist does not hurt when it is stationary, but hurts when I test it by moving and twisting it around a bit and hurts even more when I lift heavy weights with it. I went to the doctor last month and x-rays show no broken bones/fractures in the wrist. I 've been seeing a physical therapist for a couple of weeks and they say my hand is stable, though they have noticed a little bit of swelling, but they do n't know for sure what the problem is. Is it probably just a sprain or could it be something more serious ?? The pain really is n't as bad as I 've perhaps made it seem but what I 'm more worried about is why the pain has continued to persist for 4-5 months... I am wondering what I should do to get the wrist back to 100% ?? My physical therapist has me doing stretch exercises and has recommended I put ice on the wrist after workouts and I 'm supposed to have a nerve induction test performed within the week but other than that is there any advice someone out there can provide me with to nurse my wrist ?? Thanks !!######Sorry about the double posting######When I first started lifting, my left wrist would be sore and abit swollen for a few months too. Thought I had really done something wrong at first. Then figured I just strained it at first. I had some inflexibility with both and could not completely turn ``palms up ''... especially with my left. Doing sulpinating bicep curls especially was painful for awhile until the supporting muscles were strengthened and the tendons got accustomed to being stretched and moved so much. I had been doing strength lifting for over a year now. Started out doing this for three days a week in college classes for 4 semesters. Now that the classes are over, six months ago, I workout at least twice a week at home. A couple of weeks ago, I upped my dbl curls to 35lbs Found doing hammer curls was the only way to lift them right now. But able to sulpinate using 30lbs... if only for 3 sets of 4 reps. I had been doing sulpinating curls with 25lbs easily before. My instructor had all the women start out doing this style of bicep curl instead of the hammer with lower weights. It works the forearm and the wrist as well. I found I liked lifting and just ran with the premise of ``women's strength building ''. Went further than the others. There are some forearm exercises you can try to build up the wrist better with lower weights.######I know what kind of pain you 're talking about. I had a simular problem but mine was caused by doing barbell bicep curls. Felt fine if I did n't move it but moving it in certain ways caused pain (twisting or up and down in my case). I too got an x-ray and everything checked out fine. One thing I did which seemed to help was wrap my wrists up in ace bandages. You can do it only at night if you want so you are n't all bandaged up during the day. Ice is also helpful. The biggest thing is rest. I know that 's not what you wanted to hear but it 's the truth. A few weeks is n't long enough. You need to give it around 4 weeks. If you continue on with it in the state it 's in you 'll be looking forward to arthritis and stuff like that when you get older. Either stop doing the exercises that hurt the wrist or lower the weight to a point where it does n't hurt and it will heal up in around 4 weeks time. Also you might try wrist supports when lifting to give your wrists extra support and limit your range of motion when lifting so you can continue lifting without pain and let your wrists heal better but stop using them when your wrists get healthy otherwise you may further weaken your wrists. But generally rest is the most important thing and making sure you do n't continue to hurt your wrists.######That is kind of weird. Might try 2 things. 1: anti-inflammatories like ibuprofin. Couple times a day, morning and night. And 2: rest with heat/ice therapy. Avoid painful movements for a few (3-4 weeks). Also use a heat pad for 5-15 minutes, then immediately apply ice for 5-15 minutes (can use hot/cold water too). Do this back and forth a few times but always finish with ice. The heat causes hyper inflammation by drawing blood to the injured area. Then the ice pushes it all out, dropping the swelling. This is literally pumping nastiness away from an injury (note: do n't ever do this on a fresh injury. 48-72 hours old AT LEAST) and can help hasten recovery. That 's about the extent of my non-medical injury advice. If you get really concerned or if it just does n't get better (or keeps getting worse), consider a specialist. Good luck, man..######-Diet-Fitness###-Exercise & Fitness

Both wrist do not bother me when I am not using them but when I type like now (although not to bad, its a lot worse when my hand is on the mouse and using the mouse), write on paper, do push-ups (which I ca n't do anymore because of the pain), and even turning and gripping the steering wheel of my car. My wrist did n't go through anything tramatic recently that I can think of they just started hurting, and I had n't been on the computer much for about 2 weeks because I was moving and nothing was hooked up. I am very active on the computer, just turned 21 but I have spent years and years somtimes on the computer 16 + hours a day programming and playing games (I do n't do that anymore thanks to having to much college work). I also ride dirt bikes and race motocross and have been in a few bad wrecks, one where I jolted both my wrist super bad (but did n't break anything) and had to keep both them in a brace for a month; however, this was about 6 years ago and I hav n't had any problems since they healed so I do n't think thats what wrong right now. I just really do n't know what brought this on and its REALLY effecting my because I can hardly write and I have to write paper after paper for my classes and I just ca n't do it its starting to hurt so bad. I just started working on a math assasignment and after the first problem I stopped because it was hurting and came on here. The pain in ALL directly in my wrist, right where the crease from the hand and the arm come together and all the pain in within a half of inch each way of that spot on both wrist. My questions are, does anyone know what this might be? Could it be CTS or does it sound like anything else? Is there anything I can do or try to help the problem, doing wrist strenghtning exercises just hurts it worse and when I try almost all those exercisies my wrist pops with each motion from up to down or rotation. Any advice, insight, anything would be really great and thank you in advance.######Have you tried wearing a brace for a few hours a day. .

I wear it when i know im gon na be on here.make sure you have support under your wrists whjle online... a lil pillow for the wrist to rest on. . i also have had quite a bit of pain in my wrist. . i just had the ct release done a month ago !! Maybe its time for you to call the doc ?? Take care######Ya I started putting a small towel under my right wirst when using the mouse, it seems to help a little. I am going to go get a couple wrist brace like today cause this sucks, that and some more pain killers.######I think what you 're describing is the same problem I 've had, and I 'm 22. The only thing that 's worked for me is really relaxing the wrist for a few days. Since you probably wo n't be able to operate with no hands, try wearing a brace on one wrist at a time and \* really \* relax it. . wear a sling if you need to, just do n't use the wrist at all. After thinking a lot about when my wrists hurt most, I 've found that they 've been their worst after taking a long drive in the car. I 'm talking about 8 hour drives that I took to and from college during which I was nervous. I think the problem might be tension. For you, it might 've been caused by moving if you had to do a lot of heavy lifting because you might 've been gripping the boxes tightly. After you 've relaxed your wrists and they start to feel better, it might help to stretch your fingers straight out regularly when doing things that might cause your hands to tighten up. I do that now when playing guitar and driving (which really hurt before), and generally my wrists are doing much better. Definitely do not bend them when they hurt like that because I think that makes it worse.######Thanks for the suggestions, I will for sure try to rest it and keep it in the brace when writing and doing pretty much anything for awhile.######Did your wrists ever get better? I 'm still battling on and off with mine.######hey that is the exact same spot where I am feeling pain. It is only on my left hand and hurts really bad when I lift some stuff like cooking pans. this just came up suddenly. I do n't know if I have carpel tunnel though.######Give your wrist a break! Get off that mouse for a while... do this stretch. If it is your right wrist that hurts, extend your right arm straight, with your left hand, make a circle around the bad wrist with your left thumb and first finger. Using traction, pull right hand away from you, then stretch right hand down toward the floor. You are pinching a nerve between bones every time you flex that wrist. It will take a while for the nerve to go down. If you have to do push ups, do them with the wrist straight, knuckles down..######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

I do n't get the pins and needles feeling but my fingertips tend to feel pretty funny. Also my left wrist has been sore for the past few days and I do n't recall doing anything to injure it. Anyone got a clue what it could be? I do n't do anything repetative with my hands other than knitting and that 's only about 4 or so hours a week.######ament: How much time do you spend on the computer? It sounds a little like carpal tunnel syndrome. It 's common with repetitive motion. Hairdresseers get it from using the scissors alot, data entry peope get it from typing alot. If you 're on the computer alot you might need a wrist rest to help keep your hands straight. You also need to keep your keyboard FLAT !!! Do n't keep it at an angle because it stresses the tendons in the arm/wrist and causes the nerves to be pinched. You can also wear a brace on your wrist at bedtime that will help keep the wrist from moving. They sell them at any drugstore. The knitting can add to the problem too. It 's repetitive. If it does n't get better then see a doctor and he 'll tell you whether or not you need to have it operated on to relieve the pressure off the nerve. You could also try putting some heat on it to bring some blood flow to the area. It might help relax the wrist. Are you able to twist your wrist and crack it? That can release some of the pressure. Good luck..######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Orthopedic

My wrist had been hurting a few days earlier (this happens often: it usually subsides within a day) and had continued hurting. The doc said I had ulnar nerve entrapment but did not do a wrist xray. She gave me prednisone which stopped the tingling for the most part. A few days later, the elbow pain started so I made an appt with an ortho who said it was ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (the poking behind the elbow test resulted in lots of pain). He ordered a nerve electrocuting test which came back that I had ``great nerves ''. He said this was due to overruse. So, for the past three weeks I 've been on Ibuprofen (3 doses a day, 3/dose) and the tingling/numbness seems to have settled into a ``about to fall asleep '' feeling that occurs sometimes: doc says this is a good sign that inflammation is finally subsiding. However, this morning I woke up to wrist pain again and I 'm really concerned this will start the cycle over. I am finally to the point where I can sleep comfortably without behind my elbows being sensitive and I am sooooo freaked out that I might have to go through this again. Has anyone had this sort of thing happen again where it 's cyclical? It seems since there is no entrapment, surgery is n't really necessary. I do n't know what 's causing the wrist pain (still no x-rays) but I do have an appointment with a hand/wrist specialist in two weeks (soonest I could get in; I made the appointment over a week ago!) . I 'm so upset about this, do n't want to ``deal '' with this forever... is there any relief in sight?.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Orthopedics

Around two months ago I injured my wrist. I was using one of those grip strengtheners, the things with handles you squeeze together. That particular session I went a bit over the top, squeezing it as hard and as fast as I could. It was pretty sore afterward, but I thought nothing of it. Over the next week or so the pain got pretty bad. I was n't able to bend it at all for a few days. Anyway, it 's nearly 2 months later and whilst the pain has reduced somewhat- I can move and bend it now without too much trouble- it 's still not 100%. The pain occurs when my wrist is bent at a 90-degree angle, for example when I do push-ups, or bend my wrist all the way forwards and backwards. It just generally feels a bit sore and achy, especially in the cold. Thanks for your time.######Probably the best thing to tell you is to stop excersing and let it rest... But, being young and active, I am sure you wo n't do this... We are not doctors here, (you can speak with them only when you address them at the top of the page where it says ``Ask a Doctor '')... What about a wrist brace? . . It may help a bit... If this continues, have it checked out... You do n't want to live with this pain... Most important would be to take it easy... An injury like this can haunt you all your life... Good luck... Caroline######Thanks for the reply. I have reduced the amount of exercise I do, but not fully. I 'm joining the Army and as such have to keep active. It 's also why this problem is particularly worrying for me, because I wo n't get into the Army with a dodgy wrist. A wrist brace is a good idea, I actually went down my local street today to look for one, but unfortunately could n't find one. I 'll probably head into the city tomorrow and with better luck will be able to get one.######I hope that you found one... Your local drug store should have some... Hey, good luck in the Army... It 's a wonderful way for a young man to find himself... I wish you well... Please take care, Caroline.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Orthopedics

I did n't think anything was wrong at the time, until it started hurting again that night, except then I was also getting cramps in the right side of my chest, seemingly at random (it would hurt for a few minutes on the left, then stop for about 15 minutes, then hurt on the right side for a few). I was also feeling general upper chest tightness. The next morning when I woke my chest started hurting periodically, and throughout the day I was getting cramps in various abdominal spots such as the chest, stomach, and kidneys. That night the pain was becoming quite severe in the heart area so I went to the hospital to be sure it wasnt anything serious, despite my age (17). At the hospital once I told them I had n't done any athletic activity to aggravate it, they did an EKG, Blood tests and a chest x-ray. All of the tests came back perfectly normal and the doctor didnt know what the problem was, but he suspected it was inflamed muscles in the chest, or that I was coming down with an illness such as pneumonia, and perscribed me Naproxen to deal with the inflammation, if there is any. My mind was at rest until yesterday, when I started getting more pulsating cramps at complete random parts of my body (a fingertip, the bottom of the feet, the wrist). Also, I started getting this pain in the back of my neck. Today the pain is very similar to yesterday, and I have been having more random cramps. I have no idea what the problem is, and I was wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms or knows what the cause is. Any help is greatly appriciated, and thank you for your time..######-General###-Open to All Other Health Topics

Sometimes I have bouts of sneezing where I will sneeze 3-4 big sneezes in a row. And sometimes I just sneeze all throughout the day. It gets annoying when people in my classes say bless you multiple times throughout the day. Is this an effect of being pregnant? because i have never had any allergies and i 'd sneeze before but not that much. Also, I have read some posts on here that say mild cramping is normal during pregnancy. However, the cramps i get, they are not random and do not feel like PMS cramps. It is just when I lay down. I try to position pillows to kind of prop my belly up (even though it is not all that big yet, i am 18 weeks) Is that normal? does anyone else get cramps when they lay down?######Sounds like you are experiencing the two very common joys of pregnancy. First, being extra mucus production and second, round ligamant pain. I have had a stuffy nose for 7 months, and I even get frequent nosebleeds with mine. The hormones make you produce more snot, which probably makes you sneeze. The pains sound like they may be from the ligaments supporting your uterus stretching as everything gets heavier. And they are not always mild. They can range from a dull crampy ache to a sharp, shooting spasmodic pain, usually on one side or the other in the lower abdomen. You are definitely at the point in pregnancy when these would start to affect you. Your baby is in the middle of a growth spurt!######Tif Tif, Welcome to preggars! Those have been TWO of my symptoms of being prego. My sneezes are so violent that I leak urine every time and I have to wear a pantyliner all the time; as far as the cramps I to always get them at nite although now its more BH cramps that last throughout the day and very uncomfortable.

It ended up that I was very seriously ill. Part of my illness is that my bowel formed a fistula with my bladder. This infected my bladder, which in turn infected my right kidney and blocked it up (doctors told me that if it went on for much longer I could have had kidney failure). I have had a lot of treatment since then but have noticed a few things in the last month. I am not taking any anti-crohns disease medication yet, I am only on an Iron and multivitamin supplement at the moment. But I am having the following symptoms, please tell me if I have something to worry about, or if I am looking too deeply into these:- Every now and then, my left kidney is twitching (this is n't the one that was fully infected). It feels as if it is beating and pulsating. - Any time I check my heart rate (at rest) it seems to be quite high. It can be anywhere between 90- 126 beats per minute. - Occasionally I am getting headaches. the front of my head hurts. - Diahorrea all the time (although I understand that there are things I should n't be eating now that I ca n't digest everything lol)- Breathlessness. This could be even from running up 2 flights of stairs at home, which I have never had any problem with. This breathlessness only lasts for about 10 seconds and then I 'm fine. - My thumb keeps on doing this thing where if I try to hold it still, it moves and twitches itself, and no matter how hard I try to keep it still I ca n't. (this is probably completely unrelated) That 's all. Please let me know if I 'm just havering (as we say in Scotland) and I have nothing to worry about, or otherwise. Heid######forgot to say also, recently I 've been sweating a hell of a lot, I mean I do n't just sweat, it 's in beads under my arms.

For a while I 'm experiencing something weird about my left wrist, thumb side. When I wake up at night or after some period of not using my left wrist it feels stiff and when I put weight on it (like when getting up from sitting in bed) there 's sharp pain at the base of the thumb/below thumb. And usually accompanied by loud snapping/popping sound. Few nights ago I got up from my bed and did n't notice the stiffness and when I put weight on wrist it make a really loud sound and there was sharp pain as well. Sometimes it happens in right wrist too but not that much, mostly small pop without any pain, or it (stiffness) pass with movement. I wonder if it 's somehow connected to fall onto my wrist (about two years ago). I slipped on ice and fell backwards on my wrist (left). It barely hurt and there was only minor tenderness and even less pain around thumb base area. Could there be some connection?.######-Bone-Joint-Muscle###-Orthopedic

Hell i couldnt even turn the door knob at my job today######falfie2007, Unfortunately, there is no quick answer to generalized wrist pain. It could be coming from several different sources. When you ``pop '' your wrist and it goes numb, that is because you have hit or compressed a nerve, most likely the median. When you hurt the nerve, it goes to sleep, this is called neuropraxia, which is reversible. Just do n't do it too much, nerves are very picky, and you may injure it enough that it does n't wake up. It sounds like you have some sort of instability in the wrist. Unfortunately, that can be from several things. You could have scapholunate instability, leading to a SLAC wrist. But, there is also radiocarpal instability, which is more generalized. Without a good exam from a hand surgeon, you probably wo n't be able to tell what is going on in the wrist. And some x-rays will have to be taken also. You can try using a small wrist support for activities. Just be sure to take it off several times a day, to do range of motion exercises. You do not want to get a stiff wrist. You can try to do isometric exercises of the forearm muscles, to strengthen them, as they cross the wrist joint and stabilize it. Over the counter antiinflammatory medicine (if you can take it) may help, but you would have to take it regularly, not just as needed. But, in the long run, if the above suggestions do n't help, and since it has been going on for over two months, it probably wo n't go away on its own, so you may have to see someone. I would jump to a hand surgeon, rather than start with your GP, as the GP will give you a prescription for a wrist splint and antiinflammatories; then refer you to the hand surgeon when they do n't work. Good luck..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Orthopedics

I have pain in my left wrist. Although I do n't feel it all the time but whenever I try to lift any heavy object I feel quick pain. I got this pain when I was playing with my friends, 2 years before, by a sudden push on my hand. There is no problem with bone, so help to resolve this issue. .######Okay, if it 's been going on this long, there may be something that needs treatment there. Go to an orthopedic doctor and have it examined. In the meanwhile, try stretching and massaging the wrist. You can also ice it twice a day. Try to avoid doing things that hurt.######You may have a ganglion cyst. They are common in the wrist. Do you notice any small jelly like bumps anywhere on/in your wrist area? Try to avoid sudden movements- they can cause the cyst to pop and it results in sudden pain when this happens. Sometimes they can be drained or removed by the doctor- but usually these ones would have to be seen/felt. If you find one you can also pop it with a large heavy book like a textbook or encyclopedia. They are often recurring even if you get rid of them. Massage, heat or ice may help as well as it could be a number of things..######-Health Issues###-General Health

A spot on his back that has bled and scabbed for almost 2 yrs was squamous cell. At the initial biopsy, the doctor said it was most likely not cancer and that if it was, they would call him in 24hrs. They called him 8 days later. Uggg, He is 36yo, a nurse. Does anyone have any experience with this? prognosis if left ignored this long? Treatment options. I too am a nurse but we just did n't get this far into skin ca treatment in school. Thanks in advance for any info. Leora######Hi, I do n't understand why did n't they remove it and the area around it too. I had sequella cell carcinoma on my scalp. The dermatologist removed it. If it 's not treated, there is a 5 year survival rate. Did the doctor tell you that? It needs to be removed! Gingerly######Best I can say is do get research into it. Good thing it is not Melanoma. Scc is very easily dealt with. Do the research on IT and not the other (MM) I am always amazed at the medical profession not dealing with skin cancers. With Malignant Melanoma on the rise world wide... and so few udnerstgand it, even Oncologists and Dermatologist do not get it !!!! more teaching is what is needed. Bonnie######SCC is easily dealt with provided it is caught early. If the tumor has penetrated the fatty layer it becomes a different animal entirely. I was diagnose with an SCC 4 yrs. ago that they estimate had been growing for 6 yrs. I was 28 at the time. They removed a 3 1/2 cm by 5mm tumor from my temple. They said it was just about at the point of mets. when removed. No lymph involvement (luckily). While rare, once SCC does move, it 's extremely aggressive. Please reccomend a Mohs surgery to him, it has the best overall outcome with the least tissue loss. Most people can hardly see my scar even though it 's on my face. also, bear in mind I 'm not a Dr. this is just from my experience. 4 yrs. later I have just been put on topical 5-fu for my entire face to kill rampant AK and establish which are deeper tumors. Once you 've had one SCC it 's vital that you keep up on your checkups. I did n't and now I get to have a hamburger face for a few months and possibly more tumor removal. Do n't under estimate SCC !!!######Wow, I would so change dermatologists, ``yesterday '', after that 8-day neglect! Carelessness? Good luck with the AK's! I had a biopsy for an SK which looks like and is sand-paper rough like an AK, so I 'm a little worried about possible mis-diagnosis, also ca n't find any info on the web about a blue niva or nivia that is very near the SK. Looked up all kinds of sites about skin lesions. Anyone ever heard of one? I know it 's benign, but just want to know more. I have five grown children, one a redhead, who I 'm also researching for.######Hi, Ga Lady, One of my grown children, a son, is also a redhead or strawberry blond, and loves the sun. You work in a dermatology office? How nice. Since learning some terminology I 've been doing web searches and learned quite a bit. Most articles say actinic (solar) keratoses develop into SCC, (Squamous, in case any fearful new person is reading) but ONE says actinic keratosis IS SCC! And that it 's often mistaken for the benign sebborheic keratosis, even by specialists and pathologists, so you betcha I 'm watching like a hawk any change. I wanted to make like a thumb print impression and did n't want to put ink on it. Mercurochrome and iodine are n't colored any more, so I used some of the clear zinc ointment they give you for keeping it moist while the punch biopsy heals, contains an antibiotic. Blotted it onto some blue paper, then outlined it with a ballpoint and a sharpie in case that fades out, and dated it. The thought even occurred to me, there 's so much news about corruption these days, and a nearby city's mayor who has cancer just squandered about 3.5 mil of the taxpayers' money for a bldg to demolish, reporters suspecting his campaign contributers will profit somehow, ``what if '' you had political enemies who could get their hands on some big money and would tamper with labs? The gov' t ``standardized '' all brands of thyroid meds back in about 2001, must not have told any doctors, and some of us in forums developed Fibromyalgia, part of it maybe permanent, not so painful now but I still ca n't get my arms high enough behind my back to unhook clothing as I used to. The lab report, first one I 've ever seen, of course looks okay, says ``R/O '', meaning ``Rule Out '' SCC, calls my biggest lesion a '' seborrheic keratosis- flat type '', which I do n't find in my internet searches at all. Three lesions in all on this leg, biggest one horizontal oval shape, about as big as from my thumb joint to the end of my thumb, and a very small one, and one they called a blue nevus. Which I 've read can have several kinds of malignancy if it gets to that point. I 've had moles removed and thrown away too, maybe completely burned up for all I know. It 's great that you 're in such a good mood. Were n't you really tired for a few days after the verdict, from all the stress? Sure hope you have a very happy b.d. Tuesday, and many, many more! Thanks to everyone and let's always keep each other posted. Anyone ever heard of AK- Flat Type? I plan to keep looking, when I dream up more search terms. Will also ask my podiatrist who debrides diabetic foot ulcers and knows a lot about everything, and my primary care doctor what he knows. I read that some primary doctors send in biopsies. Some smaller cities may not even have dermatologists.######Just tried my web search again and bookmarked a whole page of flat type sk's links. So I 'm settling down but of course will keep watching and educating my kids about it. We used to say get sun block with a strength of 15, but now there 's 30! And I would no longer trust even that after this scare.######Hiya I have many many `flat type ' they drive me batty. They look like pasted on blobs of stuff. Tomorrow I go to the surgeon to have a rather strange `freckle ' checked out, the dermatologist does not like it.... I say out dratted thing out !!! I also have stage 2b melanoma, which was removed and followed by a WLE (8 inch scar) and have been under watchful eyes of so many doctors, and oncologists it is quite crazy. But I keep watching my flat blobs. (add the mix of many many skin tags) I never was ' a sun worshipper ' and always sought the shade. But at my age, it is a life time of just being a kid playing all days out doors. Several severe burns almost a lifetime ago, sure do come back to haunt you. Now it seems a nevus has developed on the central part of my retina, causing more concern all around, so along with my every 3 month derm checks, my every three month oncology checks, (and I call it my sanity calm appointments) I have had to add every three month eye doctor appt. this watching and waiting for `things to pop out ' is very very hard to deal. Also the many CT scans due to lung nodules, which are `on the watch too ' melanoma sucks. I try so hard to follow the slop on goop, slap on a hat, slip on a protective shirt, and now I try to remember good sunglasses, (I never wore them except when driving before, and now ??? my mind is all foggy. Also have hypothyroidism, but that has been under `control ' now since 1996. (also I sometimes `appear ' on our thyroid board...######Eagle, You 've got me tickled. Not meaning to giggle. I am ``still '' learning ``derm '' talk. LOL! I know ``Mel '' talk but when we get to that keratosis and sebaroeujsj stuff... I lose it. I will try to find out more tho. BonBe, Girl, I have a freckle on my eye too! It 's in the white of my eye. Been there as long as I can remember. They look at it. And that 's about it. OF course AFTER all this mel stuff... and the internet (which by the way will scare you to death IF you read tooo much) I decided to have the opth to look at it. He said all is well! Thank you for the Happy Birthdays! I appreciate it Eagle! I will be 37 years young March 14th ~ Praise the Lord!######Let's coin a phrase here... DERM SPEAK now that is something we can strive for. I for one, am sick and tired of not understanding words when they first are uttered in my general direction. I guess we all have this `learning curve ' the nevus that the eye doc found is not visible (the black blob (not SK) on my lower lid, looks like a messy job of mascara dribble- it has penetrated through the lid, to the inside. The nevus is apparently in the `center of the retina ' which makes it uncommon as opposed to on the `whites of the eyes' (spoken with `do n't shoot till you see the whites of the eyes '' was that hmmm Napoleon to quoted that, or the Duke of Wellington... I forget) twas a joke I feebly tried to say here! The oncologist at the hospital says he will have it ultrasounded (that sounds gross) I can take all sorts of wounds, and stuff, but eyes ???? eeek. But on the good side, it is so very rare (if at all) that cutaneous as well as ocular melanoma occur. But who knows with me... I root for just old age... (passed 37 eons ago) haha just remember everyone.... when in doubt get it checked out.######Bonbe, I hear you about the many-decades-ago peeling sunburns, used to live in Fla and go to beaches. Who knew, back then? We had Coppertone and maybe one other brand, but no SPF 30, no inkling of the danger. You have a good retina specialist? Maybe it would n't hurt to secretly see another one just to be sure? In a couple of days I 'll be having a milestone birthday, WELL past 50th, have had a woman retina specialist laser-seal my ruptured diabetic blood vessels, too late to save one eye, did n't know of her in time. Sure did n't think I could ever let anyone mess with my eyes, but was suddenly seeing just a large inkblot in one eye, probably blood, and anything's more tolerable than the threat of complete blindness. I 'm also in the thyroid forum, may have an absorption problem, taking levothyroxine 300 and still very tired, which could be partly age, diabetes, etc.. Guess you knew the gov' t ``standardized '' potencies of thyroid meds in about 2001 w/out telling doctors, apparently, and a lot of us got Fibromyalgia. So sorry to hear of all your cancer scares, requiring humor for coping. Guess you know, at least three famous televangelists' wives that we know of, TammyFaye, who has a website by that name, Jan Crouch, and Dodie Osteen who wrote a book, all Pentecostals, who 've been healed. Will add you to prayer list. I was so stressed from just a biopsy and waiting two wks, still tired, I can imagine what you 've been through. Ga Lady, did you ever hear of a scissors biopasy? I forget the title of the thread, which right now is the top one, suggested she ask you. Editing to remove a brand-name, which I believe it 's against rules to mention, and to say it 's actually a little after 6:30 am here in the upper Midwest.######I 've never heard of it. We do what is called a `wedge ' but it only cuts a portion of the mole out. Kind of like a snip in the center or the side. Not with scissors tho. But with a blade.######Eagle, If you mean a blue nevus it 's a harmless mole that is deeply pigmented but usually benign. I just googled blue nevus and a bunch of stuff came up. I only know what it is because a girl in my office just had one removed.######Thanks, Ga Lady and Franklin. But my ``blue nevus '' on my lower leg is flat and feels like sandpaper, not anything like a mole. I googled it too. There 's three lesions on this one leg, pretty close together, the blue nevus and two SK's, not AK's if the diagnosis really was correct. I 'll just watch. I 'll be seeing my podiatrist Wed. afternoon, regular debridement of a callus that sometimes gets ulcerated, and I think he 's also studied dermatology, knows some of everything, told me I 'd be having a punch biopsy. It goes down to the layer of fat. Since the biopsy, the rough part of that largest lesion feels to me like it 's a bit smaller, but the brown spot it 's on is about the size of a bandaid pad, horizontal oval. The dermatologist said only because I 'd had some pain with my S- which- looked- more- like- an- AK, (which from the start is a SCC, does n't develop into one, I learned by googling) she 'd do a biopsy. When I sleep on that side it rubs on my hard mattress, so I 'm trying to keep a pillow under that leg now. Thanks much again, both of you. I really appreciate your input. Good luck with whatever problems you have, also. Hey, it 's almost spring! Beautiful sunshiny but cold Saturday.

The study, spearheaded by Japan's health ministry, monitored 39 000 men aged 45 to 74 over about eight years, during which time 116 developed the type of cancer called oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Esophageal SCC is a common type of cancer among Japanese men, strongly linked to smoking and drinking alcohol, according to the study led by Shoichiro Tsugane, chief of the Epidemiology and Prevention Division at Japan's National Cancer Centre. The study divided men into three groups and found that those who ate the most fruit and vegetables had nearly half the risk of developing oesophageal SCC compared with the group with the least vegetable-based diet. ``An increase in consumption of total fruit and vegetables by 100 grams per day was associated with an 11-percent decrease in the incidence of esophageal SCC, '' the researchers said in a statement. The study concluded that vegetables, especially the so-called cruciferous family of vegetables that includes radishes and cabbages, may help prevent oesophageal SCC. A diet rich in fruit and vegetables would lower the risk of developing this type of cancer to nearly one-third, even among men who smoke and drink, it said. But the study warned that fruits and veggies were no substitute for the health benefits of quitting smoking or drinking. A scientific study at Britain's Institute of Food Research showed last month that men who ate more broccoli, one of the cruciferous vegetables, reduced their risk of prostate cancer and other chronic diseases..######-Mens Health###-Erectile Dysfunction

A brief history first, I am 55 and about 20 years ago I was devastated when a doctor told me I had a bad SCC and it had to be surgically removed. Well, I have had time to get use to this procedure and over the years have had increasing incidence of SCC's requiring removal. I have just come back from the doctor's 1 hour ago after having my latest SCC cut out. I get on average 2 a year requiring removal. I have several ``Hot Spots '' on my body that get increased roughing of the skin and regularly have them frozen (they always return). At the same time, the SCC's requiring removal usually start with an identifiable and unique tingle under the skin. These tingles usually form into a red lump and progress to the stage where there is the tell-tale central dry crust that seems to be directly connected to a pain sensor under the skin (time to get it cut out). This is usually associated with Lymphatic swelling in my r/h groin, and under my r/h arm. Sadly this is a routine I am quite use to now, and this is usually the only reason I see my GP who I have every faith in. She jokingly thanks me for allowing her to keep her surgery skills up to date. I have regular blood pathology and x-rays and nothing unusual is evident. What I am most perplexed about is a relationship I have noticed with my SCC flair-ups and arthritic pain. The doctor tells me it is impossible and I tell her it happens every time over the last 5 years of SCC flair-ups (about 7 removals). These Arthritic events differ each time usually and are isolated to one location-- The shoulders limiting my arm rotation field-- every joint in each hand-- Upper back Scolioses-- every bone in my toes etc.. The last event was the bony prominence on the inside of my right knee that stopped me from walking. The pain was enough to wake me at night. I usually recover completely from these Arthritic events and this corresponds with my sun cancer activity stopping and the same site problem does not present itself-- it is always a different joint. I see this relationship as either of the following: • A general Physiological problem lowering my resistance that ends up spurring the SCC's and Arthritis in the same sequence each time. • The SCC problem that starts the events (I shudder to think about this one). The Doc says the only way to tell if they are related to each other is to undergo gruelling biopsy's and pathology tests the next time it happens. I obviously want to stay away from this unless this association between SCC's and Arthritis has been experienced by others. Anyone's input will be very much appreciated.######There is a link between arthritis and SCC, but in opposite direction. Acctually, SCC's can be induced by a type of drug used for treating arthritis. Immunology disorder as a link between SCC and arthritis, makes sense, but, there is no clinical data for that.######I am not on any strong medication- Try to use only paracetamol, and when the pain is too much I take Panadene. I eat well and take Glucosamine and other vitamins. It is too regular to be a coincidence- only when SCC is having a party....######-Cancer###-Skin Cancer

He was no help at all, apart from taking more blood. But I was interested in what you think about his statement. I asked him if I could have fibro and he said '' No, your ESR is 13, which is normal, so you ca n't have fibro ''. What do you think?######I went to two of the top doctors in their field in Chicago. Listed in two magazines as being tops in their fields. One was a Rheumatologist and the other a Neurologist. Rheum said I do n't do n't have Fibro and the Neuro says I do. Had blood tests and I assume ESR was one of the tests I had. Rheum says I did not have the tender points of Fibro patients and Neuro says pressure point test is nonsense. So who do I believe. I 'd tell you to get a second opinion, but I 've gotten 5 opinions so far without pinpointing the cause of my problem. I 've yet to hear of any test that would confirm Fibro.######The ESR is not a difinitive test. A high ESR indicates inflamation. I 'm guessing your doc's logic is that if your ESR is normal you do not have inflamation: therefore you do n't have Fibro. The problem seems to be that there is no sure test for the problem. Probably some doc's still do n't believe it's real. I do n't know if I have Fibro but I do have RLS. Since I could not sleep and was always tired my doc is starting there. Once I can consistantly sleep, we will see what symptoms are still there. RLS is one of the problems that there was no answer for, but there are meds that help.There is criteria to make a diagnosis. Hopefully my symptoms will lead to some help. I do n't have the required amount of trigger points to make a diagnosisof Fibro.######The Neuro told me biopsies have been taken by researchers of patients with suspected Fibro and the tissue shows no signs of inflamation. Even though people complain it feels like it and the pain is simular to someone with arthrites. Tissue samples were taken at the height of a Fibro attack. This is why he does n't believe in pressure points. Theory is Fibro is a chemical imbalance between Adrenelin and Seretonin. Thus the sleep problems, not enough seretonin being produced by the body and not being stored properly. Adreniline not being used properly. Of all the reasons for the cause of Fibro, this makes sense to me. So who knows.######I find this very interesting. I have noticed going through perimenopause that this is a signficant problem regarding the adrenaline and the seretonin in my body. I have had a very soar neck upon awakening, soar back, although I had a car accident, it 's hard to relate or put it all together here. But I can go back before the car accident and see that there were times I had problems with my immune system, fatigue, body pain especially with change of weather. Pains in the joints, etc.. Now I have the muscle tremors in my hands and the muscle spasms. Went through the insomnia part, still have that occasionally. I need to figure this out. What good doctors are available in Chicago for detecting if you have FM? I 'm currently taking a low dosage of Prozac, 10mg. I split it in half and take 5mg. It is helping. Was n't depressed just anxious. I wish these jerks in my fingers would stop. It drives me crazy to type lately.######I bought Chicago Magazine and there was a list of top doctors in there. I and they did n't help me much at all. The one guy was$ 250 for 1st visit and$ 125 after that. I stopped going to him also. He gave me Ambien to sleep and Lexapro. One was to produce seretonin and Lexapro was to save it. Lexapro made made stomach sick. Tried Zoloft also. Yeah, they numb the pain, but they also numbed my brain. Could n't take walking around in a daze. As crazy as this sounds, I bought HGH off the internet along with DHEA. My Fibro symptoms have decreased greatly from it. Been on it about 6 weeks now. I still ca n't sleep so I take either Xanax or Atavin to sleep. Pzizer and another drug company are suppose to come out with a Fibro drug. I also found that Tramadol works better than Vicadin for my symptoms. I read that Tramadol for what ever reason targets the symptoms of Fibro better than other drugs..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

This past Tuesday morn, I wound up being admitted to the hospital via the er, because of my worsening cognitive problems, and hands shaking and unsteady balance, numbness and tingling, etc.. Got released last night. Had a bunch of tests-mri, ct scan, bloodwork, EEG, Doppler of carotid arteries... My Neuro said he thinks its all my Fibro flared up pretty bad-since the tests they gave me are coming out neg. and Fibro actually causes many neuro problems like Ive been having, like the memory so bad, attention problems, the cognitive problems, slurirng speech, spelling, talking in a mumble, stumbling, balance and gait problems and even the trembling of my hands and pins and needles i get everywhere now... even down to the ringing in the ear !! I did n't realize just how fibro too, can affect neuro aspects like lupus does, I guess because I always focus more and research my Lupus more than my Fibro. But was surprised to find out just how much fibro can affect these areas too! I had the EEG right before I left so do n't have the results of that yet, but the mri and doppler of my carotid arteries were fine as was the ct scan. The Lupus is quiet now, according to blood work, so its got ta be the fibro-which makes sence because my rheumy said in Feb. that it was my fibro flared up and causing all the worse pain and problems then-so now, it got worse I guess, and made even more problems. I see my rheumy soon anyways and have to go back to the neuro soon-both rheumatologists and neurologists treat people with fibro more thn any other doctor, so i guess we 'll see what rheumy says and then neuro as far as the best treatment for this relyy bad flare up. I guess if the eeg comes out okay too, i just got ta wait and see what the docs say and want to do now. I have been feeling so crappy lately and was due for more ear tests on Tuesday, (so far, ear/hearing checked out fine at visit to ENT a month ago) but I was getting so much worse, it was time to get seen asap and not by an ENT. the symptoms I 've been having got too scary to put it off any longer and knew that the trembling and cognitive problems are not from any ear problem! lol I have to call today to reschedual the ear tests- (ENG, ABR and ECHO G) because ENT still wnats them done. And who knows maybe there is a problem in there that its just coincidence that its happening with the other problems going on too. All I know is something is wrong and its scary and worrisome to have my mind and body and with my balance and the trembling of my hands getting worse and worse. Guess time will tell and results too. Cathy######sorry your not feeling well. i have lupus also and along with fibro, raynauds, and DDD.being sick sucks i hope you start to feel better soon. i have alot of the things you decribe.hugs to you... love marie######Cathy, you really need to go on the Lyme Board and look at the symptoms for Lyme disease, you live in NJ which has the highest incidence of Lyme in the country, you are having too many symptoms that do n't coincide with fibro, and knowing Lyme the way that I do, I would seriously say that there is a major chance that is your problem. I am not doc, but have researched Lyme through and through and also Fibro and Lupus, being misdaig. for 8 years gives one a lot of time to research. Lyme is a very serious and dangerous disease and needs to be treated immediately, it can cause all types of neurological problems, dizzyness, ringing in ears, vertigo, tingling and numbness in arms and legs, fatigue, joint pain, rashes, light sensetivity, head aches, breathlessness, and alot of other symptoms. Please look on the Lyme board at the sticky, and if you decide to get tested for Lyme do n't let your doc's test you by any other lab than Igenex, it would be best to make an appt. with an LLMD LYme Literate MD, there are a list of excellent LLMD's on the Lyme board that are in NJ, NY & CT. I live in Texas, but my son and I fly to CT to see our Doc's, the disease is so prominent up there, the odc's are the best in the country. Good luck and God Bless######morning cathy, sounds like you are having one huge flare up. i also have fibro and lupus. they mimic each other so well. you mentioned waiting to see what the doc wants to do next. what do you want done? always remember you can say no to any treatment. you know and i know there really is nothing science can do for us, except make us as comfortable as possible. finding a balance of meds and exercise along with a healthy diet really is all we have. ourselves. doctors are nice and all, but ultimately we must care for ourselves. i see the sad look in my doctors eyes. i know she wishes she had a magic pill. i also know there is n't one. there is only me. so i force myself to exercise. eating is an issue. no feelings of hunger so i forget to eat. i still get the trembling and stumbling and dizzy and all that you experience. since i have had 3 strokes each time it happens i ask my body, stroke or fibro or lupus? i just passed my one year marker on the last stroke. yipeeee! what i learned to do was relax with it all. it is what it is and worry will not change it one bit. worry will make it worse. never forget fibro loves to eat your fear and vomit up pain, horrible pain. not worth it. peace, bluelakelady.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

My neurologist ordered an EMG/Nerve conduction study and said it was negative for the most serious, scary things, but that it was n't completely normal either. She wants to redo it in 6 months. I 'm relieved to have life-threatening possibilities ruled out, but I wondered if fibro might cause an abnormal EMG/Nerve conduction study. Has anyone who 's had the twitching had these tests done? I have not been diagnosed with Fibro but I 'm trying to decide now if I need to continue with my neurologist or go to a rheumatologist. Thanks!######hello there. i personally suggest you go to the rheume. i have fibro/cronic fat but also auto/thyroid/hashimotos and a slew of other things. my rheume is great and extremely helpful. my neuro did the emg and told my rheume that i have a problem concerning neuropathy. i will see neuro next week. the tingling and shaking and numbness has to be ruled out by neuro first i 'm told. its to make sure there is no nerve disease like narrowing of spine, stinosis, disc problems, etc., causing the twitching or tingling. muscle rubs are a great help to begin with. sincerely hope######I just started having random twitching also. It happens when I am relaxing in the eve. or while I 'm sleeping. Let me know what you find out. They (My many Doctors) ca n't seem to pick a single diagnosis and stick with it, so I ca n't help you there. I get the results of a sleep study in a couple of weeks. I will let you know if I learn anything. Hang in there. At least we are in good company.######I just started having random twitching also.

I will let you know if I learn anything. Hang in there. At least we are in good company.######The involuntary muscle twitching was one of my main symptoms at onset but has since subsided. It was just awful. Sometimes whole muscle groups would jerk. Cutting sugar out of my diet helped.######I have restless legs and take meds for that at night but when I am tired I get twitches all over. My legs are worst but I even get them in my arms and my hands can start shaking so bad I ca n't hold a drink. My mom had neuropathy and what I see happening with me is the same things I saw happening with my mom. And that scares me because within a short time she was unable to do a lot of things for herself and was in lots of pain. This was just a couple of years before her death...######I 've had fibro for 5 yrs. I 'm now being ruled out for MS. I had an EMG a few weeks ago due to all the twitching. I was use to twitching a little bit from fibro but I twitch quite alot now. The EMG came back normal but like you it was n't as normal as they like. I was having a fibro flare at the time and it showed ``shades '' of a muscular disorder. My neuro did n't know what to make of it and has planes of repeating it in the future. When she put in the needle it brought me to tears. She said she has never seen anyone have as much pain as I did with the procedure. I do have a rhuemy who runs a fibro clinic who has said my new symptoms are deffinately not fibro. I would go get a rheumy's opinion and if they feel it is not fibro stick with your neuro. But your neuro should know a great deal about fibro also. That is who dx me in the first place.######I have full body tremors. These alone are severe enough that I receive SSDI. I have a hard time holding onto things when it 's all at it 's worst. I have had them since I was a small child, hoerver, and was dx with FM til my mid-20's. I 've had MRI's, EEG's, MRI's, CAT's. You name it they 've done it! But the test results have always shown normal. Wish I knew...######My son developed a twitch when he was about 9 years old. We took him to a Neurologist. They did a brain MRI, EEG and blood work. All was normal except the blood work. His strep antibodies were 1300. Normal is zero to 200. Ruling out everything else and family history they stated the twitch was due to the strep. Apparently he had strep that went undiagnosed and it attacked his nervous system and caused the twitch. It 's so out there that they are not sure how to treat it. He takes Fluphe \*\*\*\* ne to control the twitches.######Years ago, while being treated for what I now call; ``Pre-Syndrome Symtoms '', i.e. depression and panic disorder, I had bad boughts of tremors. Had EEG, was good but not quite right. Changed meds and seemed to subside. After Dx, have times when muscles twitch and still get boughts of slight tremors. Havent been re-tested. I just chalk it up to the FMS/CFS. I guess if they get annoying, Ill follow up on them again. Feel Well, Felicia.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

I 'm 48, and have had a myriad of health issues (most recently a cervical fusion in ' 06), it would take forever to explain it all. For the sake of explanation, two other major events were a possible Guillain Barre episode (during a 10 month battle with Mono) and ataxia due to medication. Anyway, my family doc sent me to a Neuro who did a nerve conduction test on one arm, the typical neuro observations and dx 'd me with Fibromyalgia. I 'll be honest, I think ``fibromyalgia '' is just something the docs came up with when they could n't find answers for other unknown chronic pain issues. This last neuro made me feel like I was a hysterical female (which I am far from being). I believe there truly is a disorder that everyone suffers from, I just think since it 's not life threatening, the docs put finding out the cause on the back burner. I just want to clarify I do n't in any way think anyone here, or with the dx, is having ``hysterical '' pain, quite the opposite, I just have a hard time a disorder being named for the symptom, rather than trying to find out the cause. While I have Chronic pain (some due to the neck fusion), I do n't have the tender points everyone talk about, just the area below the fusion. Actually, you can use a tremendous amount of pressure in my muscles and I barely feel it. My pain is typically a horrific deep ache in my legs mostly, but also my thoracic spine, lower back and sciatica. The sciatica area is the only place you can touch and make me jump, but it requires a lot of pressure to get that reaction. Anyway, I do n't get where this dx comes from. Are n't the trigger points susceptible to horrible pain if touched? Touching does n't bother me at all, the pain is too deep for that. I do have other symptoms that could be fibro, but it could also be MS or a neuropathy. Am I the only fibro patient out there who does n't have trigger point problems ???######Hi, Tender points just above your joints are fibro. Trigger points are in myfascial tissue or muscles. Do a bit of work to find as much information out there as you can. DebeachSiren######Thank you for that explanation. It does seem I have indeed intertwined the two terms out of ignorance. I 'm still confused as I do n't seem to meet the criteria of either, I ca n't imagine why the neuro would give me a diagnosis in that case. Again, please do n't think me disrespectful or minimizing the Fibro sufferers' pain, as I can very personally relate to it. I 'm primarily frustrated that a) I do n't fit the criteria and it seems to be a easy dx for the neuro; and b) My symptoms do point to another disorder (MS), but it seems no one wants to look past the fibro dx. All of my symptoms that, to me, point to MS also seem to point to Fibro, at least that 's what my GP comes up with. Anyway, thank you again for your response.######Hi Cyn, I know what you are talking about. I do n't have a lot of \* trigger points \* either, just a few when the doctor touched them. My pain is more like either it 's hurting all day in that area, or it 's not. Touching it does n't necessarily make it hurt more. I can sympathize with you about the neck, back and sciatica problems. I have that, too, and it 's the worst pain. I can hardly walk and I feel like my back is broken and I 'm 100 yrs. old! I also think I have something more than fibro. I agree they throw the diagnosis at you just to shut you up.######Maybe you have pinched nerves from chronic myofascial pain. I did and after i had trigger point (tender points are different, and i can not find mine, but my rheumy sure can) injections and physical therapy for about 3 years, they have finally gone away. fibromyalgia is real.

I 've been suffering from FMS for going on 11yrs now. Although when I go to the doc sometimes with a new but obvious problem that is NOT related to Fibro they often blame it on that. You know in your mind it 's not but without even checking you out they automaticly look in your records and say '' I see here you have Fibro '' and then just blame it on that. It could be a Myocardio Infarction and they could blame your fibro! Case in point. I went to my Rheumo with obvious back pain that was pinpointed in one area. I had been telling him this for over a year. He just kept blowing me off. He kept telling me it was muscular in nature and it was my Fibro, even though he knew I had DDD, Osteopenia and had recently been envolved in a car accident. I finally got the other Rheumo to take a closer look and insisted on a MRI. She also put in a consult to Neurosurgery. She said, it 's not your Fibro. I was like, you think. Neuro took one look at my MRI and said my L-5 disk was gone and now I 'm headed for total disk replacement. I 'd been suffering like that for well OVER a year. It 's bone on bone pain. So please tell me I 'm not the only one.######No, you are not the only one. Everyone with fibro face the same thing over and over again and again. You have to learn how to get the doctor to work with you and not just brush you off. If your doctor will not look for the real cause, get a second opinion. I have told the doctor up front that the misery I have at the moment is not like my many fibro miseries and insist on looking further than fibro for the real cause..######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

I had it pretty well under control with occass. flare ups during weather change. I was exercising 45 min 3x a week and pretty happy and healthy with minimal flares for 2 years. Then the trouble started. My symtoms changed to what looked like MS but since my tests are all neg. the 3 neuro's I 've seen have blown me off and are blaming my fibro but my G/P and rheumy who specializes in fibro says it 's not my fibro. This has lasted about 1 year now. New symptoms: tremors and/ or vibrations stabing pain in temple, jaw and in arms and legs, usually lasting sec. to min. vertigo nerve pain down my arms and legs with no muscle tenderness lasting hours to weeks extreme fatigue, again with no muscle tenderness loss of function of foot for 12 hours loss of function of arm for 6 hours then 30% use for about 1 week no function in 3 toes for 1 month My other symptoms sound like fibro but because I have no muscle pain or tender spots it 's very hard for me to think this is fibro. I did have a flare in Nov. with muscle ache and tender spots and the whole nine yards. What I would like to know is, if anyonw else has experienced this or not. Do y' all think this is my fibro or should I continue to figure out what else it is? I hate having my fibro blamed because the neuro's just do n't want to deal with me. Any advice would be helpful. Thanx.######I 'm sorry to hear you are experiencing new symptoms especially after 2 years of mimimal pain. Sounds like you 've done a good job managing your flares and pain levels. Nerve pain has been my main problem, not muscle. My dr. who is a fibro specialist says that many fibro sufferers experience nerve pain. I do have tender point pain, but most of my pain is in the nerves in my arms, wrists, hands, calves, temples, etc.. I had an emg and ncs which said I have carpal tunnel on both hands. Had 2 brain MRI's came back ok. I went to the Cleveland CLinic in Aug. 05 and left with more questions than I came with. Plan on several visits, I had a total of 4, each with multiple tests, bloodwork etc.. What a great place with excellent doctors. (somewhat unfeeling but I 'm ok with that if they are good at what they do). They think I may have limited scleroderma and low degree fibro. But they would n't officially diagnose it because my blood came back ok and I fit criteria for several different autoimmune disorders. I 've always been skeptical about my fibro dx because of the nerve pain and various other symptoms that do n't fit with fibro, but I do think there is some fibro in there. I did a drug trial for Cymbalta for a year, it did n't help my pain too much, so I may be trying Lyrica here soon, but I 'm trying to be drug free for a while and focus on exercise and stress reduction to see if I can just ``get through '' my flares on my own for a while. To me the worst part of all this and for any disease is NOT knowing. I do n't think a lot of doctors realize that and that alone can cause so much more stress than the disease itself. So hang in there, you 're your own best advocate and I 've learned if you do n't keep pushing to find answers, the doctors are n't going to do it for you. It 's a fine line between crying wolf with every ache and pain and making your doctor realize there is something really wrong. Maybe give it a couple weeks or so and see if any weather changes make a change in your symptoms, otherwise, I would definitely let my dr. know about your new symptoms.######Your new symptoms mimic many of those of MS. Perhaps it might be a good idea to see your neuro, and perhaps had an MRI with contrast to see if lesions are causing the tremors and numbness and nerve pain. Hang in there! MimGregg######Thanks for y' alls responses. I have been tested for MS. At first the neuro's thought that 's what I had but the tests (MRI's, Evoked Potentials, and EMG) have come back normal. So of coarse they rather push everything to fibro instead of looking further. It 's just that I always thought that the nerve bpain was associated with the muscle contracting around the nerves. This I do n't have. I also burnt my fingers last yesterday. It hurt for about 10 sec and then nothing. I have that hard shiny skin that comes when you burn them but no pain what so ever. I have a feeling I 'll have to make my appt with the Cleveland Clinic for the summer. It just seems to me that no one shares these weird symptoms that do n't quite fit with fibro.######You are smart to keep searching. We all need to be our own best advocates for our health. Keep searching, I hope you are able to get treatment and help you need. Mim Gregg######I have and have had many sypmtoms like yours, though I have not had loss of use for hours. A Dr. told me that I had early stage MS back in early 2002. I had the MRI, and was supposed to have follow-ups for the next 3-4 years. Have n't done it, as I have no insurance. She believed I was an MS sufferer prior to the MRI because of my symptoms. She said that not always will an MRI show the lesions in the early stages, but she was unwilling to do any other tests at that time as I was about 7 months pregnant. She did n't work really well for an FMS Dr. as she was not that convinced about it. I think you would be wise to contact another Neuro, or consider finding a teaching hospital close to you. Students and recent graduates are well versed in the latest research. I am considering the teaching hospital in my area. Drawback? It is about 200 miles away. Good luck!.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Fibromyalgia

I was reading some research that suggested FM sometimes starts after a cervical disk issue. If so, does your disk cause you any problems?######Hi May76, I have herniated cervical disk which has caused me a lot of headaches, horrible headaches and very stiff neck. I have gotten 3 epidurals for this and it really has alleviated a lot of the headaches, I do n't think it will ever take the pain away completely, but it certainly has made my life much more livable. In my case, the cervical problem was found after the FM, but I have had headaches for about 13 years, about as long as I have had FM, so who knows which came first. Sunny######YES! I have a 3 level cervical disc degeneration disease. I will be having a 2 level fusion done in sept.. I had one epi steroid done in Feb 2007 and it really helped the headaches. That told me the headaches were coming from the cervical problem, not from the fibro. But I had had a reaction to the steroids and am now considered to be ``allergic '' to steroids. Allergies popping up from left field quite common for fibro. I really ca n't say which came first, the fibro or cervical problem as I was seeing so many doctors for indivisual symptoms. BUt I do not believe the two are connected as my cervical problem is caused by arthritis and my fibro is just that, fibro... you have it and learn how to accept it and then it is easier to live with it. I do not allow my fibro to change the quality of my life. But my cervical problem is more serious as I have lost some neuro functions and the discs are indenting my spinal cord, which is dangerous. Now, my surgeon has asked for all the info I can give him on fibro because just the trauma of the surgery could bring on a fibro flare up. He wants trigger point diagrams etc, so hopefully we can prevent a fibro flare. I do not know if this is of any help, but I will check back here every so often and see if you have any other questions... good luck. . Martha (in the Philippines)######My FM started after I had cervical surgery. I had an Anterior Cervical Discectomy with Fusion in 2000 (r/t car accident). About a year later I started having pain and tingling in my hands and arms. I guess that was the beginning of the FM. I now have 2 herniations on either side of the fusion (beware of that, a fusion will eventually cause problems above and below it). I have daily pain and spasms in my neck and upper back. Its hard to say whether its FM or just pain from my neck being ``altered ''. I know that physical therapy has helped me loosen up in the past. I can not turn my head very far and I am sure that helps add to the pain. Good luck!######I had a 2 level ACDF in Jan 2007. I was recovering okay, had some neuro issues following, but was dx 'd with atypical migraines, and perhaps some nerve damage from the spinal cord compression. I slipped on the ice in Jan 2008. I went downhill after that. I was dx 'd with fibro in April of this year. I am sure that the slip and fall caused the first noticeable flare. I read a very interesting article that talked about one the common causes of fibro being cervical traumas, including the position they put you on for neck surgery. When I read the symptoms that this doctor stated his patients were reporting, it was me; my DH read the same article and could n't believe what he was reading. I was not surprised by my DX of fibro in April. Not happy about it, but not surprised either. If you enter cervical trauma induced fibromyalgia into your favorite search engine, you might also find the same article I mentioned.######I am finding this thread of interest since I get 24/7 occipital headaches. I have DDD. From the CT it shows- anterior and posterior osteophyes at c5-6. - bilateral foraminal encroachment at c5-6. - degenerative chanes c4-5 disk without herniation. - foraminal encroachment at c4-5 as well. - degenerative changes within facets at multiple levels. - degenerative changes in right costovertebral joint at T3. Have any of you had? - a stiff sore neck- dizziness on moving (more like an equilibrium problem)- occipital headaches (mine are 24/7)- stiff burning shoulders. Could my degenerative changes be causing all this? Biya######Hi Biya, Yes, I used to have the headaches 24/7 until I got a series of epidurals. They have alleviated most of my pain. Sunny######Sunny... Could the D changes that I have be causing All of this? Where on you head is your headache worse? Do you have occipital headaches? Biya######Biya, I do have occipital headaches. Most of the time they are around the outer back of my head, but they can change and go to the right side of my head, strangely enough, after years of having them just on the right side and the back, now I can also get them on the top, front and then all of that at once. Not being a doctor, and going by my own diagnoses, I do think that the Changes you are having are causing them, that is if there are no other underlying causes that they have not looked for yet. My neck used to get very sore, I always thought it was just my muscles and stress causing them, until I had a MRI a couple of years ago showing the bulging disc in my neck, and to my knowledge (who else would know) I have not had any accidents of any kind. Sunny######Sunny: Thanks for the prompt replies. Who did you epidurals? Rhuematologist? PCP? Pain Clinic? Biya######Hi Biya, I go to a pain clinic, the doctor there does the epidurals, but to do them I have to go either to the hospital or outpatient surgery. Either way, I get the Doctor from the Pain Clinic. They have never let me down, and now that the series of epidurals are finished, I can still keep getting the trigger point injections as needed. Sunny######Sunny- Is the epidural an injection into a specific site? How was the site determined? Would I have to show them my CT result? Biya######Biya, Yes, if the ct scan shows the bulging disc (s) than yes, they need to see it so they know where to put the epidural. They asked me where it was the worst, and I told them the right side, that is where they did the epidural. They have like a sonogram, but not a sonogram, I forget what it is called, but they have a screen there showing them where to guide the needle. I did it without any anesthesia, but most people get anesthesia. It really did not hurt, I could feel the pressure, that is all. Let me know if you get one and how you are doing.

Nothing? Something else?######MS certainly can cause pain... it 's an illness that affects the nerves. If we did n't have neuro receptors, then we would n't feel anything. I do not understand why some doctors, including some neuros do n't get this. They would if it happened to them, for sure. My neuro does understand this and has been very compassionate. Fortuntely for me, my pain has gone away for the time being. BUT, sounds to me that it may be a time for you to fire your neuro. Call your regional MS center... or go to NMSS.com and find an MS center near you that can meet your needs. Remember that neuros, in general, treat a great many of people with neurological disorders other than MS. You need one that specializes with what ya got. :--RRB- Good luck and God Bless. Sherry######Thanks for your affirmation... I was thinking the same thing... regarding pain and also needing a new dr.. . now I need to do some searching on who to go to...######I agree with the previous person.

Has anyone ever had this pain before. Just curious.######By location, where specifically is the pain in your neck? Can you describe the pain, frequency, pattern, type? PS: Pain in the neck region alone would not be enough to be Fibromyalgia, the condition. If you clench your teeth that can trigger pain and spasm. In another post of yours you mention your dentist suggested ``tmj ''. What are you doing to help that? Are you wearing a guard? You also mentioned you have the pain in the chin to the ear especially when you clean etc, you may be passively clenching, which may be triggering the facial pains. If you clench a lot it can cause other neck muscles to spasm. I take cal/mag to help muscle and nerve function. I have a problem with tmjd, clenching and bruxing but it 's not limited to the head and neck. With Fibro, the pain and muscle trouble, joint pains are more widespread and not limited. ps: Perhaps daily neck and shoulder range of motion gentle stretching will help you long term.

I never had asthma with a child and start wheezing and having chest tightness after exercise. Does this mean I have asthma for life ??######Hello, and thank you for your medical question on e Health Forum. Asthmatic bronchitis occurs as a exaggerated response to environmental stimuli, presenting as breathlessness, audible wheezing and paroxysmal coughing lasting for various duration due to reflex bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the respiratory passages). This disorder can be definitely controlled effectively with medications. Once exposure to the responsible environmental stimulus ceases, the condition resolves itself. The rate of recovery is dependent on each individuals immune system. Exercise induced asthma, is also due to hyper-responsiveness of the respiratory tract to exercise. The remedy in this condition is to use a aerosolized bronchodilator, (prescribed by your health care provider) just before you start your physical exercise. The condition also tends to stabilize with time and proper training. Asthma inducer environmental induced or exercise induced, does stabilize and resolves with time. Once diagnosed it does not mean that a person is asthmatic for life. I hope this helps.######You have a nutritional deficiency. You are not getting enough Essential Fatty Acids in your diet. Essential Fatty acids are needed for healthy respiratory functions. This happens all of the time, If you start taking Essential Fatty acids like omega-3, omega-9 and omega-6 in the optimum amounts, your asthma will begin to go away. You will also need to take what are called the 90 essential nutrients on a daily basis. Look into it for yourself before you get on any medication.######Thanks very much for the reply !!!

She alomst died but they did wonders in there. She has recently got it for the second time and is now recovering from it, now the doctor is talking about the long term effects this could have on her like asthma, and lots of other things.Im going crazy trying to research all this.I just wondered if any one out there has been through this or has a child that has asthma from rsv or other things that the rsv caused. Please if any one has any insight on this please let me know. Thankyou. connie1790######Sadly, I have 2 children with asthma who had RSV as babies. My 4 year old had it at 2 months and has been on nerbulizer treatments on and off since that time. She takes nightly asthma and allergy medication. My 21 month old son had it and was hospitalized for it. He too has been on neb treatments and takes medication. Luckily, my 4 year old is getting better controlled so she does n't deal with it as often. I truly hope that your daughter will be fine. I wish I had a better story to tell with my own children but do n't lose hope. Good luck######I have four kids.Only One of the four had RSV and does NOT have asthma.I do in fact have a child with asthma who did NOT have RSV and asthma does n't run in our family. Asthma is something that with a good doctor, a few trial and errors with meds, and patience and diligence can be controlled. I am actually grateful that is the worst of our health issues. GOOD LUCK to you!######My granddaughter had RSV at 11 weeks- in ICU and very, very sick. Today she is 20 months old and healthy as can be. When she gets sick it tends to hit her lungs- she's had a couple of trips to ER's and needed a breathing treatment when she had a cold. Her pediatrician is reassuring that as she is getting older, bigger, and more resistant she can fight these bugs off more. I do know that they recommend flu shots for little ones who get respiratory problems- at the beginning of flu season. Isnt ' there also a vaccine for RSV? Good luck and I hope your little one stays healthy!######There is a series of shots to help prevent, reduce the affects of RSV; however, they are very very expensive and insurance will only cover them if the child is a preemie or has a chronic condition. These shots are given during RSV season- once a month during the first year, sometimes second year of life.######Thankyou so much to all of you that has responded to my story, im dealing with a cough that will not go away right now. Im giving it one more week then i will be calling the doctor. Im afraid that the cough she still has is a gon na be problem. Any how thankyou so much for all your input. connie1790######My son who is now going to be 4 had rsv when he was 2. It was pretty severe and he was hospitalized for a week. The cough lasted forever !!! I remember them telling me that the cough could last for up to a year later !! Yes, he also has asthma too... although he had it before rsv. I have to say that he in general was sick alot. I also have a 10 year old and he was never in the hospital as a small child while my younger son has been admitted several times. This past February we decided to do tonsils and adnoids out and it has helped tremendously !!! He has n't been sick since (of course he has a slight cold/fever now, lol), and I have definately noticed that his neb treatments/asthma has gotten so much better !!! He used to get a cold/cough and I would just know that we would soon be in the hospital. These days... he has n't even had a cough/cold till now and has n't needed his neb treatments at all. Definately, a great sign of better things to come! Good Luck and hang in there. My opinion is that most kids do out grow this stuff, asthma included (hopefully)! I know that in my case my little guy does seem to be making major improvements as he gets older! It gets better and you will get smarter and stronger! Take care and best of luck!######Well here is an update on my little girl, Danielle is seeing the doctor today to discuss her having asthma. she has been coughing since the rsv and that has been a couple months now. she just had a head cold and it caused all kinds of problems so she is now getting albuteral treatments every 4 hours and we will see what else todayafter her appointment. Thanks again for all your stories this really helped. connie1790######My son was a premie, received the shots to prevent RSV the first year but got RSV anyway. He was hospitalized for a few days. The next year, he got RSV again and was again hospitalized but for 5 nights this time. He does take flovent to help prevent wheezing when he is sick and they feel he probably has asthma. I think the kids who have asthma get the RSV settling in their lungs, not the other way around. I have never been told of any long term affects of have RSV. I think the virus just affects the kids with the asthma and lung problems more..######-Family###-Children's Health

His mom and dad have also tried eliminately the carpet in the house, but they still have a dog. My son also has asthma, he is 14 now and his asthma is n't as bad as it used to be, he was also diagnosed at 6 months old with asthma, we have his symptoms under control with singular, advair, flovent when needed and also ventolin when needed. After fighting with family doctors with the amount of flovent he was on I demanded to see an asthma specialist, and once we seen him and he changed the medication from flovent to advair, what a huge difference, within a week we noticed a difference. Also once puberty hits sometimes teenagers grow out of the asthma, so do n't give up, keep investigating to see what works best! Good Luck!######This is an interesting topic as my son is in the hospital again from asthma (second time in five days) so I 've been looking this stuff up every chance I have. He had one bad asthma attack several years ago without a problem while he lived in Florida. Now that we are up north all heck has broke loose once the cold front came in and it was colder than Florida ever gets. He is having such a bad time with this right now but the preventive meds have n't had enough time to kick in so these hospital scares will continue for another week or so. I 'm hoping it will get better but it will take time. Last I was with him the hospital was breathing for him but he was stable and they felt he would be out of ICU on Monday morning. He is worse mainly because he has the flu really bad so that is making the asthma ten times worse. I 'm kinda saying this because its very interesting to note this change from having no problems for years in a warm climate to things getting really bad in a cold climate. Also note we were here up north for the entire summer without even a notice of breathing problems.######Thank you for the reply. I am so sorry to hear that your child is having a difficult time. I can empathize with you. My son has been in and out of the hosptial and it is really difficult as a parent to see them going through that and know that we ca n't do anything to make them better. I think for myself i am going to get second opinion about my son's asthma. I feel that there could possibly do more to it then just asthma. He has a hard time getting excited, in gym class, laughing and even when he cries he starts to cough and weeze like crazy and this ca n't be normal? . Anyway all the best to you and your family and let me know how things are going with your child.######Sherrylee, You may like to try a couple of doses of Phosphorus 30c and see if that helps. Phosphorus 30c is a safe homeopathic preparation and have been found of much help in asthma and cough worse in cold air. It jsut might help.######All who take Singular please do further research on the drug! My son was on it for 3years. He 's now 5. His kindergarden teacher wanted him tested for ADHD. Lots of impulsive behavior problems, trouble sleeping, pale skin with dark circles under the eyes, Nightmares. I found some very upsetting post about Singular and the side effects. My son has been off of it for 2 months and he is a competely different kid. Even his teacher asked what I did. This drug can be like a poison to some people..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

She wheezes when she gets sick, which has been 3 times since then. We just saw a pulmonary specialist who prescribed xopenex for a few more days, and started her on pulmicort twice a day for 3 months. Two weeks ago, before we saw the specialist, I took her to the ER. I was terrified, but she was better after albuteral + another med (I totally just blanked out on the name, but it starts with an A) and then an Decadron before we went home. Is this normal? I read a bunch of posts about little kids, toddlers, who are so many medications! I am really scared. I keep hearing that a lot of kids outgrow this, but I have this fear that without meds she is going to stop breathing. I have never said that out loud before. And I just got some dumb parenting magazine that said ``If your child is on Xopenex more than twice a week, then the asthma in clearly uncontrolled '' What am I supposed to do with that information ??? RC######Calm down, me and my sister both have Asthma. Since we were babies. Sometimes you grow out of it, sometimes you do n't. Either way you got ta have faith. Let the doctors take over and help her, I 'm sure something good will come out of it.######i do not agree with the calm down part of this post. yes you can have hope your kid will out grow it but DO NOT let your guard down. my 4 year son was exactly the same as your child and he was constantly on all diffenernt kinds of med till they found the ones that worked. they also put him on prednisalone about every 3 weeks every winter, all winter. i am currently in a childrens hospital with my son who is now in a vegitative state from a heart attack caused by an asthma attack. i dont want to scare you but just stress the fact people do die from asthma, my son was getting better and we thought he was out growing it and it just took one bad attack and look what happened. all im saying is dont let your guard down and take asthma very seriously.######I am sorry for your troubles. However, you are taking that quote out of context. What they mean is on it because the asthma is out of control... not on it for a short time to get over a bad flare up. As young as your child is it may take some time to get the meds regulated because your son can not articulate what he is feeling. Any asthmatic who is having to use a rescue med (altbuterol or xoponex, etc) more than twice a week does not have their asthma under control. For the time being, just keep an eye out for symptoms, be sure he gets his daily meds on time and as prescribed. Have faith that it will sort itself out soon. I was all over the place with mine in the beginning (14 years ago) but we soon got it regulated, got me to where I can jog again and am now on the lowest dose med possible (one puff of Flovent a day). It just took some time and work..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

She went to an ENT specialist because she was found to have large adenoids and tonsils; which were removed. She is STILL getting sick. Mostly coughs/colds. She JUST had bronchitis, and now has a barking cough again-- after finishing the prescription drug two days ago. Could this be the start of asthma ??######Well it would definately be worth getting checked out. I went through this every year with my son and finally at the age of 6 got him in with a ped. pulmonologist. He had never really wheezed that I could tell, but he continually had bronchitis and this cough. His tests showed he did already have asthma (little bumps in his bronchial tubes)- but was all reversible damage. His was actually attributed to undiagnosed acid reflux. This acid rose up during the night and went into his lungs- causing the asthma. Now he is finally doing so well- no more problems like before. From missing over 30 days in Kindergarten- to only 3 in 2nd grade this year. Also- when I had to take my daughter to the ER one night for croup (the diagnosis) and was given 2 breathing treatments. The ped. pulm. told me that no one over the age of 18 months can technically have croup. If your child has a croupy bark cough and they are older than 2- your child has asthma. My daughter was 3.5 at that time. She has now been to the same doctor and she has preventive meds. Hope this helps some. hrtofluv######My son came down with cold induced asthma when he was one. We were taking him to the emergency room twice a month. They wo n't diagnose asthma until they are 3 here. So, they gave us an inhaler, but that made him hyper... aaahhh. I did some reading and did change some things in our home to help with allergies and asthma, and he has been inhaler free and breathing issue free since last September. And, I think the colds/etc went hand in hand... he does n't get sick very often anymore. But, now my daughter (10 months old now) had croup EVERY month since she was 4 months old until 8 months old... so I am fearing whatever triggered my son... has been passed on to her. I am keeping my fingers crossed that she does n't have asthma issues when she gets to be 1. I will say, she seems to have possibly outgrown the croup in the last few months, though. I would make sure to get a calendar and write down symptoms, how often they get sick, etc.. . if was very helpful in bringing it to the doctor.######Hi Packerfan, It would probably be a good idea to have your child seen by a Pediatric Pulmonologist. If you want to do more searching to find out some more info, search Reactive Airway Disease. As children with Asthma symtoms are usually given this diagnosis. As i am sure you have heard many people say how their child had asthma but ``outgrew '' it, the children ``technically '' have Reactive Airway Disease. If the child is still displaying Asthma symptoms around the age of 10 and continues with the symptoms, it is them that they are diagnosed with Asthma. This is ``per '' a Childrens Hospital Pediatric Pulmonologist as well as the Infectious Disease Physician. Just some info... good luck! ValleyGurl######To koorsc. Oh how I wish they had had the 3 year rule in our state when my grandson was young. He was born asthmatic. Now he is 7 and has been asthma free for years but no one will insure him because he was diagnosed as a baby. Alot of children outgrow asthma by the age of three so I think that rule is a good one..######-Family###-Children's Health

You may have to increase your other medications (like Flovent or Advair) when you are sick.######I do double up on my symbicort when I have a cold.

Thanks Meezer.######I never had any luck with Singulair so I ca n't say what one should expect. For me it did nothing- as with many people.######From what I understand, singulair works for allergy related asthma symptoms. I 've been on it since the fall and also take symbicort. I started it when I had a flare related to allergies and it helped then. However, I did get a cold over the holidays and increasing the symbicort helped decrease my asthma symptoms then (although I still had a rough week before things started to settle down).######Colds and other upper respiratory infections can trigger asthma flares. It can be really miserable. When you are facing this situation, it is a good time to step up your asthma treatments per your asthma action plan..######-Lung & Respiratory###-Asthma

That was the attitude that helped bring him around. My advice is assure your friend that while it 's admirable that he wants to do it himself and that ultimately it 's his drive and desire to get well that will help him recover he has to accept, just for awhile other people's help.

He did a regime of chemotherapy, it did shrink the tumor, when we went to see the oncologist, he said it was still very close to the heart, and very risky to operate, so we went and saw surgeon, he was prepared to do it, but again said hemay not come out of it. My Husband was prepared to take the risk and so was the surgeon, my husband is a great believer in positive mental attitude, The operation wa svery long, they took out his whole left long, he recoverd well. out of hostpital in 4 days, anyway he had to have radiotherapy after recovery just to make sure. Unfortunatly between the time of the operation and recovering the cancer had spread to his femur, They told us he was terminal and had about 12 months to live. It has been so tough. But again my husbands positive attitude was still there, he had raditherapy on his leg and an extremely aggresive course of chemo, it really knocked him about, many times down A&E, He has a pet scan 2 weeks ago.we were hoping so much it had shrunk.just to be able to extend his life, we cant believe what the oncolgist said, he was in remission, no cancer in his body showing upon pet scan... it doesnt feel real yet, we were just told on Saturday, we still feel like we are dreaming, My husband has beeen through so much, but positive mental attitude won the day. Cancer is certainly so many ups and downs with emotions, he will be scanned now in 3 months, and checked regularly. There is hope!######That 's wonderful news Wendy!######Wendy, That is the type of message I like to read! I am in a similar situation to how your Husband was. I am 44 and was diagnosed with lung cancer in Nov 2006. This was an emense shock as we had only migrated to Australia 6 months earlier and under gone health checks. It was first thought that it was pleurisy but later diagnosed as stage 4 cancer with a 4cm tumor in the right lung and some abnormal cells in my left femur. I was told by my Oncologist to go home and get matters in order! I endured 7 months of chemo which shrunk the tumor to 15 &#37; of its original size. I changed my diet and took various natural products to starve the cancer and now after 10 months am I starting to get some symtoms again. I had radiotherapy on my femur which has reduced the pains I was getting. I have just had some full body scans which have shown no spread to any organs but two bone spots, in my sternum and one vertibrae. Its strange that my wife and I just accepted the news and feel positive that some further chemo will knock it back again. I am starting three cycles of chemo on Friday (Alimpta & Carboplatin). Once I 've finished with the chemo I will be back to the natural stuff to keep me on top of it. We have always hope that the new treatments will eventually knock it back for good. Like your Husband I have always had a positive attitude which definitely helps.######I have just had my first of a new cycle of chemo after my 10 month break, I did n't remember how hard it hits you at first. Today is my blue day as my wife calls it so I 'm just resting up. I will just need to get used to the regieme again of taking the anti-nausia tablets and building my strength up, I am having treatment at 3 week intervals so time to recover in between. In terms of supplements I have been taking Vit C, Lysine, Proline, Arginine, green tea, selenium, Sanugerman, Citrikele, Sanuvus and alcholising powder mostly recommended by my Naturapath. These are the things that I find help me stay feeling well. The three strange sounding supplements are homeopathic drops for getting rid of acid and oxygenating the blood I find them really good for managing fatigue. Well your husband is not requiring these now so thats great. well i better get back to my rest... Thanks so much for your reply! Dean######Be well... thinking of you... C######Thanks carol, Its changed our life so much, My Husband is so special and strong with what hes been through, everday is so special, we take nothing for granted, I just wish non of us here had to deal with this dreadfull disease, its so hard######Wendy, It has been two weeks since my first treatment and I have noticed some improvements. My tumor is giving me good twinges and I am not coughing as much. My only problem is that I coughed so hard whilst on the steroids that I think that I have torn a muscle in by ribs! So better not cough! Well one week to go for my next installment of the poison. . bring it on! Dean.######-Cancers###-Cancer: Lung

Penny######Have you recieved any chemo? You are in my thoughts and prayers.######babs, No I have not had chemo yet, they are going to do that next week or so.I had that x-knife brain surgery done on march 15 to the 2 tumors in my brain and the 1 on my skull.recovered fine.Had a bone scan done and they found 2 spots on my left arm so they are going to do radiation in a week or so.Had a follow up ct scan done from the removal of my right kidney in December and they found 1 lymph node that is enlarged they believe the chemo will take care of that.I have a brain scan done on April 16 just to make sure they havent grown because they cant do chemo and whole brain radiation at the same time.If the tumors are shrinking then I wont have to do whole brain radiation.I want to thank you for your thoughts and prayers, I take all prayers.I will keep in touck.Penny######Kathy, I am doing just fine recovered very well from the x-knife surgery high dose radiation, I will be doing chemo and radiation in a week or so.Thanks for being here.Penny######I 'm hoping you 're doing fine.

Hopefully I 'll have more info on route of therapy we 're taking then.######I am doing fine.You will have to let me know your story and how you made out at the oncologist.Please let me know. Penny######Well, I saw the doc today, and she wants to admit me next Monday for Immunotherapy. I 'm kind of glad we 're not just going to sit around on this, you know? I want an aggresive plan of action at this point. So I 'll probably be in the hospital from Monday thru next Friday or Saturday. I 'll let you know what 's going on later.

Like any diagnosis, I am always interested in ALL the possibilities of the causes. Doctors refer to it as a differential diagnosis. You can google ``differential diagnosis, meningitis '' & go through the list of possibilities. The reason I suggest this is that I had severe meningitis 12 years ago where I was bed ridden for over a year. My doctor kept trying to just treat the symptoms & when they did n't go away he said I had fibromyalgia. I finally found a doctor who treated patients with fibro & after tests found I had lyme disease. The co-infection ehrlichia was probably the reason why the meningitis was so severe. Lyme can mimic many other disorders, so it one of the illnesses that should be on your differential list. (Although I must tell you that you will have to have the right lab tests done & most doctors are not aware that the typical tests are not that accurate. Do a little studying on why there is controversy over lyme tests & find a lyme literate doctor & a good lab.) The effects of meningitis can be devastating and sometimes long lasting like mine. I would encourage you to seek a doctor who is compassionate in treating meningitis & pain. A neurologist would be a doctor I would get an opinion from. Keep looking for answers & solutions & never give up. When one doctor ca n't help, or tells you it is all in your head, find another one. You may have to be patient and try many different meds before you find the right combo for you. Best wishes.######-Conditions and Diseases###-Meningitis

Now hes is 6 years old but his speach is delayed and he is late in mental development. We are concerned about what to do to help him develop. Anyone with a similar situation?######i had meningitis when i was 4 weeks old. I had the same problem, but they found that i was deaf around 3 years old. So they delayed my learning development. Going through it and being in my 20's. I would just say give him as much encouragement. Not only is it difficult for you, but it is as well for him. At 6 years old i remember feeling bad about myself, because i was being taken out of classes to get speech classes. He will progress. Lots of encouragement !!! Ca n't stress that enough! I now have a certain type of infection behind my ear (my brain) and it is caused by meningitis when i was younger.######MY SON IS NOW 11. I ASKED DOCTORS EVERY YEAR IF HE HAD LONG TERM EFFECTS FROM THE MENINGITIS AS WAS TOLD NO EVERY YEAR. HE HAD PARTIALLY TREATED MENINGITIS FOR 12 DAYS AS THEY THOUGHT HE HAD A SINUS INFECTION AND CRASHED AFTER HIS LAST DOSE OF ORAL ANTIBIOTICS. HE ALSO HAS MICROCEPHALY WHICH WAS MISSED UNTIL AGE 7. THEY BLAMED EVERYTHING FROM BEHAVIOR TO MENTAL LAG AND FINE MOTOR LAGS ON HIS DEFECT INSTEAD OF THE MENINGITIS. THIS PAST SUMMER, I TOOK HIM TO THE SAMS CENTER IN TEXAS AND WAS TOLD THAT BOTH FRONTAL LOBES WERE SEVERELY DAMAGED FROM THE MENINGITIS. HE WAS ON 8 MEDICATIONS AND IS NOW ON NONE !!! HE DID NUEROMATRIX NUEROFEEDBACK FOR 3 WEEKS AND HAS HAD MUCH IMPROVEMENT SINCE TREATMENTS. DR SAMS ALSO TOLD US THAT HUNTER'S MENTALITY WAS OF A 7 YEAR OLD, BUT THAT HE WOULD CATCH UP AFTER THE BRAIN STIMULATION. HE IS DOING BETTER IN SCHOOL AND WE HAVE GOOD DAYS AND BAD DAYS NOW THAT HE MORE LIKE A TYPICAL BOY. HE IS MORE AFFECTIONATE AND IS MORE LIKE THE 3 1/2 YEAR OLD ACTED BEFORE THE MENINGITIS. HE ACTUALLY LIKES BEING AROUND FAMILY AND NOT BEING SUCH A LONER. HE STILL HAS PROBLEMS IN LARGE GROUPS AND HAS PROBLEMS WITH FINE MOTOR SKILLS WHICH ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE BRAIN INJURY. IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND GOOD ADVICE AND WE DID ALOT OF PRAYING BEFORE WE TOOK HIM TO TEXAS AND TOOK HIM OFF THE 8 MEDS. I DO NOT REGRET THE DECISION. HE WAS ON MEDS BECAUSE OF THE BRAIN IRRITATION AND NOT BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIAGNOSES HE WAS LABELED WITH. HIS BRAIN IS STILL IN RECOVERY PHASE FROM THE STIMULATION, BUT I DO SEE HOPE. HE HAD 10 SPECIALISTS IN OUR STATE AND HALF OF THEM OBJECTED TO THE TEXAS TRIP. SOMETIMES WITH THESE CHILDREN, YOU JUST HAVE TO GO WITH YOUR GUT FEELING AND KEEP LOOKING FOR ANSWERS TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM AND HELP YOUR OWN HEART BY KNOWING YOU HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING.

Another general doctor says the pain is not sinusitis at all but a damaged nerve in the area that should be paralyzed with injections. Are any of these doctors right?

My hips feel and look different from the outside, even after a year and one side is a little different than the other even tho they were both done the same day.

In other words, what are the symptoms of hypoaldosteronism ALONE, without hypocortisolism? Thanks.######It could be lupus since renal failure is a primary sign of Lupus...######? Are you saying that renal failure is a symptom of hypoaldosteronism? (Since I was asking about symptoms, not a diagnosis.) I know there 's such a thing as hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, but since this is the Addison's board, I was referring to adrenal hypoaldosteronism, which is what someone would have if they were being treated for secondary Addison's (ACTH deficiency which leads to hypocortisolism), but actually HAD primary (hypocortisolism plus hypoaldosteronsim.) Thanks.######As far as I know, the symptoms of primary and secondary Addison's are exactly the same. The only difference is whether the adrenal glands have failed because of failure somewhere else (i.e., pituitary) (secondary), or if they have just quit on their own (primary). I was originally diagnosed with primary Addison's until further tests revealed that my pituitary gland was hypo, which changed the diagnosis to secondary. My growth hormone level and my thyroid were also affected. The treatment did not change once the diagnosis did; I still take 20 mg. of Cortef per day in divided doses. In the beginning, I was also on .1 Florinef, but it was later determined that I did n't really need it, which is most often the case in secondary. I hope this helps to answer your question.######Primary also has adrenal hypoaldosteronism and if untreated you can have symptoms like muscle weakness, extreme salt cravings, and very low blood pressure. You must take florinef and extra salt to compensate. Secondary does n't have this problem but may have other hormonal loses such as low growth hormone, elevated prolactin, sex hormone problems and thyroid problems. Secondary is easy to separate from primary by simply testing the adrenal glands with ACTH. If they respond to the test, you are secondary, if you do n't respond with an increase in cortisol you are primary. It 's fairly simple to establish which is which. How were you diagnosed? What tests were used to establish your adrenal insufficiency. If it was just a blood test for cortisol, you need much more than that.######Thanks. I know it 's kind of a weird question. The truth is I 'm not sure how I was diagnosed exactly. I 'd been having symptoms that pointed towards Addison's-- salt cravings (only thought of a symptom in retrospect), orthostatic hypotention, fatigue, vomiting, etc.. But no noticeable darkening of the skin. I went into the ER for diabetic ketoacidosis. Something about my blood work-- I \* think \* my electrolytes-- was off. I remember being told that they could n't do the Insulin-induced hypoglycemia test. I have no recollection of being given any other specific tests. I think I was diagnosed as Secondary mostly because I did n't have the hyperpigmentation. But, since then, I 've read that some of the symptoms I was having were only symtoms of Primary. I 'm currently taking 5mg of prednisone a day. I also have Type I Diabetes and Hypothyroidism. For various reasons, I have n't been regularly seeing an Endocrinologist, but now I have an appointment with one and I 'm trying to have a set of questions/issues ready for her. Again, thanks for your reply!######Secondaries not having the low aldosterone problem is a myth actually. I see secondaries with low aldosterone and salt wasting everyday, but 99 &#37; of them will have low renin, aka hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.######Considering being secondary is a very rare condition and the average endo wo n't see a single such patient in his career its pretty amazing you manage to see one every day! Do you have any medical journal literature about secondaries having this additional condition? As I understand it low aldosterone is a condition originating in the adrenal glands. How do some secondaries acquire this condition when their adrenals are functioning normally? Why do some secondaries not get it?######Secondary is not rare at all. Endos are not good at diagnosing secondaries because they only look for doubling or more on the stim test. Most secondaries will at least double from a low base cortisol value. Endos do n't look at how low the base is, just if doubled or not. If triple or more from low base cortisol, then endos think that is fantasic, ignorant of how secondaries usually do on stim tests. See the article I posted on the acth stim test a few months ago. Endos and most types of docs are not looking for low aldosterone in secondaries because they 've been taught secondaries do n't have it, but does n't make sense that absolutely no secondaries out there would not have low aldosterone? No exception? I estimate about half of secondaries have some degree of salt wasting and low renin, low aldosterone. I have n't figured out why secondaries get the low renin which is an enzyme make in the kidneys. If their renin was at a good level, then their aldosterone would probably be ok since your right, adrenals usually are ok except if they decide to atrophy from lack of renin and acth. I 've been seeing low renin in secondaries for several years now, very common. I 'm secondary and my renin was below range and my aldosterone was at the very bottom of the range. I suffered greatly before taking florinef with salt. If low renin, then potassium will be mid point or lower range. Low potassium is a good predictor of low renin I 've found. I 've found low renin is a very good predictor of low acth and is the next best thing to use for determining secondary if the patient was started on steroid before having serum acth and acth stim. labs of real secondary with low aldosterone and renin Says 10 years treatment for prolactinoma, but I do n't find labs for prolactin morning aldosterone 1 (1-21) renin .6 (.6 -23) afternoon aldosterone 5.5 (1-21) renin 1.2 (.6 -3.0) sodium 134 (136-145) potassium 4 (3.5-5 .1) most secondaries are low but still in range on both tests. Low potassium is what secondaries get 99 &#37; of the time. By this sodium and potassium I would predict they would have low aldosterone and low renin. DHEA-s 2.4 (3.7-9 .5) ACTH 33 (10-60) should have been well into the 40's acth stim base 8.1 (8.7-22) 30 min 21 60 min 23.7 stim nearly tripled from very low base value.######-Immune & Autoimmune###-Addison's Disease

Thanks/ ARch######doctor can listen to your blood flow through the kidneys using a stethoscope and also order an ultrasound of the kidney######Hi Arch- Regarding your question about how to tell if high blood pressure is related to kidney problems: there are a few tests that can be done. First of all, there 's an IVP, which is basically an x-ray of your kidneys. This can show up some problems. Second, a doctor, preferably a nephrologist, should listen to the arteries leading to your kidneys (they pass over the groin area), to see if you have any bruits... these are sounds that are indicative of a problem with the blood circulation to your kidneys. If either of these (ivp, stethoscopic exam of kidney arteries) is positive, they would then probably want to follow up with a renal arteriogram. There may be other tests they can do, such as a creatinine clearance test, 24 hour urine sample, etc.. A nephrolgist, that is, a kidney specialist, would be the doctor to see. The kidneys are the organ most responsible for regulating blood pressure. There is a substance called renin which is produced by the kidneys to raise blood pressure if it 's too low. A condition called ``renal stenosis '', or a narrowing of the arteries leading to one or both kidneys, can cause blood to enter the kidney at a reduced rate, thus tricking the kidney into thinking you have low blood pressure. The kidney responds by producing extra renin to raise your blood pressure. This kind of high BP is not amenable to treatment with diet and exercise; medications must be used. The good news is that you can have this condition for years (as I have) and be fine as long as you control the high blood pressure. As far as I know, a protein urine test is for kidney functioning (i.e., filtering, etc.) and would not tell you anything about renal stenosis or an increased production of renin. You did n't say how old you are, Arch, or how high your BP is. If you 're much under 40, and especially if your diastolic (bottom) number is high, you should definitely have you kidneys checked out. Hope this has been of some help.

But I have read that only somewhere between ten and twenty percent of people are even salt sensitive. Now if I knew for certain that I was one of those ten to twenty percent, it would n't bother me so much to cut out my beloved salt. But I ca n't help but think I just do n't want to sacrifice that much in taste for the next ten, twenty, forty years if I 'm not one of those affected by it anyway. But how can one really test if one is salt sensitive or not? My doctor said try taking blood pressure readings after eating salt and without salt. But it just is n't that easy! For me, and I 'm sure for many others, differences in stress and other factors would throw off those readings completely. I 'd probably have to go at least a month of no salt, then a month on exactly the same meals and snacks but with salt to get enough readings to average out other factors and make it at all meaningful. Has anyone had any experience in determining if you really are salt sensitive?######Hi Uff-Da, GREAT topic! Funny you should bring that up- it 's been on my mind too. I 've been reading that as many as 1/3 of people are low-renin hypertensives. For this lot, the drugs that work by lowering renin are not useful. That includes beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and ARBS. This minority owes hypertension to salt-sensitivity and so diuretics (and maybe calcium-channel blockers <not sure>) are the way to go, and of course the horrid and difficult no-salt diet. Obviously, if one's goal is monotherapy (one drug rather than 16), one MUST determine what 's causing the hypertension. Some clues I am putting together: 1. I retain MUCH more water weight than other people from a big salty day... as much as 7 pounds. 2. My BP soars when my weight does. 3. Thiazide diuretics lower my BP best and give brisk diuresis WHEN I 'm full of water (not otherwise) 4. ARB's do n't do much for me. I 've started experimenting first with a diuretic... then I 'll do only an ARB. I 'll keep you posted, but things are pointing me towards being in the minority. There 's some good stuff on the net about non-renin hypertension.######Keep in mind that for the other 2/3 that are high renin, ACE inhibitors and ARBs will block the renin-angiotensin system- essentially turning them into low-renin salt senisitive individuals as well. Pal######I 'm on Lisinopril. So, if I understand you correctly, on that medication I 'm salt-sensitive whether I was originally or not. No! I am not liking this! I was hoping for a way out!######Pal, So to follow your statement to it 's logical conclusion, treating the angiotensin II-renin (and ultimately aldosterone) system really benefits nobody if the 2/3 high renin hypertensitives become low-renin salt sensistives. Thus only the low renin, sodium sensitives have any hope for monotherapy. Do I read you correctly? Do you have any guesses on what the mechanism might be for hypertension in the ``salt-sensitives '': genetic, pituitary, adrenal, other?######Here 's a couple more articles supporting the fact that you become sodium sensitive while on an ACEI or ARB: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&db=pubmed&list_u ids = 3103761 & dopt = Abstract- This one is from 1987. It was a little study that clearly shows that sodium restriction helps out an ACEI. http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/5/1042- And, here is very good article from 1995. It compares a low sodium diet to HCTZ while on an ACEI. It concludes that the two yeild similar blood pressure control. But, it prefers the low sodium diet because it does n't affect potassium levels. Pal######Thanks Pal, I 'll digest the links in the wee hours. One thing seems certain, though: to treat a low renin hypertensive with ARB's and ACE's and Beta Blockers seems a disastrously wrong approach and can only make matters worse. I guess the first order of business seems to test the plasma renin in the absence of meds. I gather, from the little I 've gleaned, that the testing is neither cheap nor common. There 's a long interview with a Dr. Joseph Laragh (qualifications too many to mention) floating around the web. That sheds lots of light on the subject.######I did read (well ok scan) the stress.org article and found it interesting. How can one determine if renin is the underlying cause? Are there tests that can be performed? If so, what are the treatment options?######I am going to try to get my plasma renin measured the next time I see my GP. I 'm presuming that a week beforehand without the meds will be a sufficient ``wash out '' period. I know the article talks about the difficulty of the two applicable tests, but I think the science is good enough so that my insurance company will pick up the tab. My take on the treatment is that high renin people should continue to block angiotensin the best way they can: ACES <cough cough> and$$ ARBS$$. The low renin hypertensives should go with the thiazides or other diuretics.######I remember reading somewhere that it took 2-4 weeks washout. And, your sodium intake had to be controlled for a few days before the test. And, it said something about needing to take an initial blood draw after resting for a couple hours. Then, another after standing for a couple hours. I can see why this test is seldom done. Dr. Laragh makes it sound like it 's just a simple blood test that everyone should have done. This is a lot more involved than the traditional 8-12 hour fasting rule for most other tests. Pal######This website describes the renin test (url) http://my.webmd.com/hw/hypertension/hw203228.asp[/url] I 'm editing the part about drawing blood. Renin Test Overview Renin is an enzyme produced by specific cells in the kidneys. Renin interacts with aldosterone (a hormone produced by the adrenal glands) and several other substances to help regulate sodium and potassium in the blood, fluid levels in the body, and blood pressure. A renin test, or plasma renin activity (PRA) test, is done to determine the cause of high blood pressure (hypertension). It is usually done at the same time as an aldosterone test (see the medical test Aldosterone). In some situations, it may be normal to have high blood levels of both renin and aldosterone. However, if renin levels are low and aldosterone levels are high, an aldosterone-producing tumor of the adrenal glands may be present. This test is usually done on a blood sample taken from a vein. Why It Is Done A plasma renin activity test is done to determine the cause of high blood pressure (hypertension), especially when potassium levels in the blood are low. How To Prepare For about 2 to 4 weeks before the test, you will have to stop taking medications that can interfere with the test, such as diuretics, birth control pills, and high blood pressure medications (especially beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors). Talk to your doctor about which medications you need to stop taking. Your doctor may substitute your medications with others that will not interfere with the renin blood test results. Do not eat natural black licorice for at least 2 weeks before the test, and avoid eating or drinking foods containing caffeine the day before the test. Natural licorice and caffeine can interfere with test results. Recent diagnostic imaging procedures that required the use of a radioactive tracer (such as a thyroid scan or bone scan) can interfere with renin test results. Inform your doctor if you have undergone any test within 3 days that used a radioactive tracer. For 3 days before a renin test, you may be required to follow a special diet that contains known amounts of sodium. How It Is Done You may need to sit or lie down for 1 to 2 hours before your blood is collected. In addition, a second blood sample may be collected after you stand for 2 hours. edited here ------- Results The results depend upon the time of day and your position (standing, sitting, or lying down) before the blood sample is collected, your age, and the level of sodium in your blood. Normal Normal values may vary from lab to lab. Plasma renin activity Adult (upright position, normal sodium diet): 1 6 nanograms per milliliter per hour (ng/mL/hr) Greater-than-normal values may mean A high renin value can indicate kidney disease, blockage of an artery leading to a kidney, Addison's disease, cirrhosis, excessive bleeding (hemorrhage), or malignant high blood pressure. Lower-than-normal values may mean A low renin value can indicate Conn's syndrome. What Affects the Test A diet high in natural black licorice can lower renin values. Many medications used to treat high blood pressure can raise or lower renin levels. Your position (standing, sitting, or lying) before the test is done or the time of day when the blood sample is drawn, as well as recent salt intake, can affect renin levels. Very high doses of corticosteroids can lower renin values. Pregnancy causes renin levels to increase. Rough handling, contamination, or inadequate refrigeration of the blood sample can cause inaccurate test results. What To Think About Many factors can affect renin test results. Therefore, only a doctor who has experience with renin tests should interpret the results. A renin stimulation test may occasionally be done if blood renin levels are low. To prepare for this test, you will follow a low-sodium diet for 3 days. A blood renin level will then be drawn and a diuretic, usually furosemide (Lasix), will be injected through an IV. Normally, blood renin levels will increase, whereas in Conn's syndrome blood renin levels will not change. A plasma renin activity (PRA) test measures renin indirectly by measuring an enzyme called angiotensin I rather than renin itself. Many hospitals now measure renin activity directly through a test called the renin direct immunoassay, which measures the amount of renin in the blood. A renin direct immunoassay is easier to do and can generally be substituted for the PRA test. However, in some situations (such as pregnancy), PRA results may be more accurate than the renin direct immunoassay.######Well, I guess that makes up my mind for me. There is no way in Hades that my GP will ever be able to get the testing for renin right. I routinely get lab results that say something like: Unable to test for <balh blah> because the sample was not centrifuged properly, or the red blood cells remained in contact with <blah blah> too long, or the sample was n't properly refrigerated. I clearly need a new < blah blah! > because mine is vaguely incompetent!######I was just sitting here watching an old war movie, & i had a bag of ACT II diet popcorn, figured not much fat I took my blood pressure when the movie was over, still sitting relaxed, and my bp was 157/109, 10 minutes later i checked & it was 156/102, its been 145/low 90's all day this is probably 30- 45 minutes after i finished the popcorn i looked at the box & each bag has 680 mg of sodium maybe it does make a difference, but then i havent had any salt that i know of all week, ive been eating mostly food i made from scratch myself######If it were me, I 'd be inclined to think the movie would probably have a greater influence than the salt. I know for a fact that my blood pressure is greatly influenced by stress. And watching a war movie would do it. Even watching the news, which is usually bad, does it. Just eating anything tends to raise the blood pressure, too, so I 'd think one would have to compare eating foods with salt and eating the same food without salt.######Come to think of it, I have one bag of ACT II diet popcorn left in the cupboard that I bought a long time ago. One of these days I 'm going to see what it does to me.######I 'm amazed the popcorn is ONLY 680 mg sodium. Are you sure it 's not 680 PER SERVING with several servings per bag? I 've had a can of soup with nearly 3000 mg sodium in it. A good way around this is to pop your own and add NO-SALT or NU-SALT to it... you can get sodium down to near zero that way! It does n't taste as good but it 's good enough and does n't pump our arteries full of water.######the popcorn was 340 mg per serving, 2 per bag i was sick last week & had some canned chicken soup, my bp was swinging all over then, i didnt think anything of it at the time, but i sure didnt feel like cooking then regarding the comment about black licorice & renin levels, i was taking licorice for years to control stomach problems (later diagnosed as acid reflux), the licorice controlled it as good as prevacid does now, but i found the licorice was raising my bp (at least when i had been off it for a couple of weeks my bp was lower at the dr's office, that was before i was monitoring it myself).######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Ive went to dr to dr and no one believes in adrenal fatigue at all. According to blood work Im fine, saliva Im not. . Does anyone have an suggestions?######Have you read the book,, by James Wilson? It has some suggestions on how to rest the adrenals so that they can regroup. Supplementing with cortisol/Cortef/hydrocortisone is a slippery slope for many, but practicing things like good nutrition, stress reduction, infection prevention & treatment-- these are things that can help the adrenals without the adverse side effects of steroid supplements. Best wishes.######The saliva tests are more reliable as they show the level of cortisol used within the cell, rather than just in the blood. I have read the book Adrenal Fatigue by Dr. James Wilson and its a great book for anyone suffering with adrenal fatigue. Just a tip in the meantime, VitC and magnesium are very good to take if you have adrenal fatigue. Licorice root can help too as long as you do n't have high blood pressure.######Hi everyone thanks for the advice. . I do take a multi- vit that doesnt seem to do be doing the trick now.unless i need to take extra vit c along with it.Ive got to find some dr or someone that can help with this b/c the higher up I go with my thyroid meds the more exhausted I seem to become... I finally bumped up to 55mcg trying to crawl to 75 and im getting worse it feels like. I would suspect t3 issues but its sitting dead center in the middle of the range. Im getting sick of feeling tired all the time. . Its hard holding down a job and trying to carry on with normal life activites with this stupid disease. . When all you want to do is sleep !!!! Take Care######lucky charms- have you had your adrenals tested? If so what tests were done? My doctor that I have seen for Adrenals does n't really use the term ``adrenal fatigue '', so that term might be one doctors have n't used. ``Adrenal Insufficiency '' might be a better term.######The tests ive had done were morning and afternoon cortisol levels checked via blood... except for this last one they only checked morning and the level was 19.92 range 4.3-22 .4. Now i have had the saliva test done twice and well the last one I did showed low levels of cortisol in the morning and normal at night. Take Care######Hi Lucky Charms. I had adrenal fatigue a year ago. I read the book as well. I was under a great deal of stress at the time. I always take vitamins. I did two things that made a huge difference and I 've felt fine ever since. I went to a healthfood store and got an adrenal help suppliment that I took regularly. I also started going to bed at 10PM every night. After just a couple of months I felt great. I still have trouble getting to bed early, but I try.######Have you had your aldosterone, renin, Dhea tested?######Dhea was tested via saliva came back normal both times.The other 2 havent done yet. . to be honest ive never really heard anything about them. . what is renin? Does this pertain to kindeys?######Aldosterone helps regulate levels of sodium and potassium in the body, which in turn helps control blood pressure, the distribution of fluids in the body, and the balance of electrolytes in the blood. Renin is a hormone produced by the kidneys that helps control blood pressure. Renin works with other chemicals to narrow (constrict) blood vessels, which increases blood pressure; a decrease in renin levels helps lower blood pressure. In Adrenal Insufficiency or Addison's disease the Aldosterone would be low, the Cortisol would be low and the Renin would be high.######oh ok... i understand... My last labs I had done they checked my sodium, potassium and a whole slew of other stuff. . My Bun was a point high and my ag ratio was low. . sodium level was 139 range 136-145 low normal potassium was 3.9 range 3.5-5 .1 low normal######I 've had my sodium and potassium tested, all came back fine. However I have very low aldrosterone and high renin with a low cortisol (11am blood drawn). My doctor said that electrolytes only change with severe aldosterone deficiency..######-Endocrine###-Thyroid Disorders

What does water have to do with blood pressure meds? I am a 56 year old woman weighing 168 pounds at 5 ft 3 inches I guess I should have asked my doctor but this was my first visit with her. I had a doctor I totally adored but my insurance changed and had to see this doctor. I really thought she was ok on my visit. She gave me renewals of all my meds that the other doctor gave me. Synthroid for thyroid Crestor for Cholesterol InnoPran XL for my Blood pressure and Avapro for my blood pressure. But she added a 25 mg water pill to take with the Avapro I have had trouble keeping the blood pressure low. It has averaged 148 as a high over (I think 90) But the 148 is correct. she said she felt the water was diluting my medication so she gave me a diretic. To be honest with you I had no idea what she was talking about until I got the pills. I do not drink much water anyway. Did wonder why I am always having trouble losing weight but figured the low thyroid was the problem. The other doctor was concerned to but did not give me water pills. Ok, so it seems like a small deal but I DO NOT DRINK WATER. I drink very little. so little my husband is always pestering me. am 56 years old and a woman. Worst of all I am moving to New Mexico. The `stay out of the sun '' directions are Ut OH. But anyway, worrying I might be worst off but sure would like my bp lower. Please advise######hello, well a Diuretic will get rid of extra water and sodium. less volume, thus lower Blood pressure. Your body will then try and compensate by releasing more renin which will catalyze Angiotension1 to Angiotension 2 and thats a powerful vaso and venoconstrictor... this will elevate your BP. InnoPran XL is a non selective Beta blocker, so this will prevent any Renin from being released thus no Angiotension 2, therefore no constriction and lower blood pressure. Diuretics cause more Renin to be released and InnoPran XL will prevent this, great combo for lowering BP. You 're a little old, and older people tend to have less renin######My doctor told me that in most cases you need to have two forms of BP pills to keep your meds under control. I also know that water pills supposedly remove excess liquids and sodium, not just water, that make your heart work harder. I am not immensly knowledgeable in this area, but I think this is why the doctor gave you the water pill to go with your other med.######The InnoPran XL I take at 10 pm nightly. The original doctor who gave this to me told me to take it before I go to bed so it begins working about four hours later as a time release. Then later he perscribed the Avapro. Another doctor added the water pill. I am a bit concerned because quite honestly, I do not drink water. My husband is always concerned about that so to take more out, well, my weight will like it anyway. Thanks for the tips and the education.######I would start drinking water, and make sure you take the waterpill in the morning unless your doctor specifically said to take it at night. I have to pee like a racehorse for 2 to 3 hours after I take the pill in the morning..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Puting it another way, has any one type been found to achieve greater% BP reductions over the other types?######It DEPENDS on the person... I 'd rate them as follows: THIAZIDES BETA BLOCKERS ACE INHIBITORS ACE BLOCKERS CCB's there are a couple of older classes that I 'll skip!######Is that your guess or is it based on some study (disrespect not intended)?######They all actually perforrm about equal. It really depends on the problem of the individual and what side-effects are bothersome for that person. Depending on the population group chosen for any given study, you can show superiority for any given drug. Diuretics were selected as the ``recommended '' class in this huge ALLHAT study. Because of this big study, the JNC guidelines were updated to recommend this as the preferred class of drugs. However, an Australian trial (ANBP2) found ACE inhibitors to be superior to diuretics. One big difference between the two trials was that the ALLHAT had a 35% black population. ANBP2 was almost purely caucasion. Generally speaking, blacks (low renin) tend to respond better to diuretics and CCBs for the initial drug choice. Whites (high renin) tend to respond better to ACEI, ARBs and Beta-Blockers. But, again, this is just racial profiling. And, not all whites are high renin and vice versa. The problem with the high renin group, is that there is a kidney feedback mechanism that is kicking in to counteract the lowering of BP. So, if a high renin person takes a diuretic (or goes on a low-sodium diet), the kidneys detect this and produce renin. This activates the angiotensin system causing vasoconstriction. In many individuals, this response can actually result in HIGHER BP. In other words, these individuals might do better to eat more salt! The best drugs for blocking this response are the ACEIs and ARBs. And, once this response is blocked, these individuals will now respond to any of the classes of drugs (and a low-sodium diet). Another way of thinking about it is that the ACEIs and ARBs convert a high-renin person into a very very low-renin person. Pal######Pal, what is renin? I am black, female, 52 with diabetes. you say that blacks are low renin, so what does that mean. I have tried all classes of bp meds and the only one that lowers my bp to acceptable levels would be ace inhibitors. Unfortunately im allergic. I like the hctz but it causes my glucose levels and cholesterol levels to rise.######JTU, I was just wondering how you are doing with your no smoking attempt.I truly hope that you are still hanging in there. It was the most difficult thing I had to do, but it will get better with each passing day. Good luck######Renin is an enzyme that is produced by your kidneys. Your kidneys produce this in response to a low sodium and/or low volume (BP) situation. This enzyme converts angiotensinogen (produced in the liver) into angiotensin I. ACE then converts angiotensin I- > II. And, angiotensin II then causes vasoconstriction (BP goes up). Your ACE inhibitor blocks the conversion of angiotensin I into II, thus breaking this cycle. At least that 's the science behind this. When I said blacks are low renin, I mean that a higher percentage of blacks fall into that catagory. This does n't mean that all blacks are low renin and all whites are high renin. Obviously, everyone has a different response. There is a test for this (PRA). But, it appears to be require a very specialized sodium controlled diet for a few days. A very interesting article on this can be found at: http://www.stress.org/Hypertension.htm Pal######Bharkins, thanks for your concern. I need it. I need all the help and prayers i can get. I am still not smoking, but it is a great temptation. Especially since I do n't work and a lot of stress is coming my way. I find that taking my walks helps alot with the stress. My husb. still smokes and sometimes I feel like asking for one of his cigs. I know my bp is connected to smoking though, so i wo n't smoke. Thanks Pal. I will read the article. How will i know if im high or low renin? I eat a low sodium diet.######The fact that you are getting a good response from an ACEI suggests that you may be high renin. Of course, a low sodium diet will greatly boost the effect of an ACEI. As far as smoking is concerned, I would n't worry about BP. I 'd worry more about the lung cancer. My wife's mom died of that. And, that has to be the absolute worst way to go... especially when it had metastasized to her brain. Pal######Well, i quit. i do n't smoke anymore as of 10/8.######That is the great thing about B/P meds. My blood tests were fine, except my glucose was slightly elevated at 103. I 'm 5 ' 11 '' 150 & eat no sweets. It 's great putting people on meds. that cause all sorts of side-effects & raise glucose & cholesterol... Make sense.######JTU, I am so happy for you and I know first hand what a struggle quitting is. My husband was still smoking when I quit (it took a heart attack to make him quit) and living with that temptation was so difficult. Again I am so proud of you and will still keep you in my prayers! Pal, I agree with you about lung cancer I watched my mom die from it when I was only 16. Something I will never forget! Cass.######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

About a year ago I started having muscle twitching which escalated in to muscle spasms. They have become severe and very painful. I 've tried Neurontin 1800mg per day which worked to lessen the spasms for awhile. When that stopped working they put me on Cymbalta 30mg twice a day which worked for about 3 weeks. Then they put me on 30mg Cymbalta and 300 Neurontin every 12 hours. This combination has now stopped working. PLEASE HELP ME !!! I am so frustrated and losing hope of finding relief. I am forced to take Ambien every night because I can not sleep without it because of the pain. Please, anyone been through this? Any advise/suggestions?

As I 've viewed anatomy web sites, the muscle I 'm referring to is the left (not right) Levator Scapula muscle. When the spasm first happened to me in around 2001, it was excruciating and lingering, so much so that I began to believe I might have meningitis. The very same severe spasm has happened to my wife, my 2 daughters, my son, and myself... a number of times for each of us. The muscle can be so inflamed as to be excruciating to touch. The spasm begins, roughly, to the right of the lowest part of the left shoulder blade and travels upward (also inflaming the trapezius) along the left side of the neck and ends at the left mastoid. The spasm presents itself as a burning, tight pulling to the left of the neck and stiffening the neck severely. It can be over in 2 days or linger for a month. Although this malady is supposed as spinal in origin, the flu-like symptoms accompanying the spasm have made me suspect a recurring virus. Does anyone out there have a similar experience with neck spams? It 's just too wierd all of my family gets this thing-- and in the exact same place.######Hi, the thing that came to mind to me was a possibility of a commonality in the type pillows/mattresses you sleep on, some sports/workout you all do, improper position if using alot of computer or playstation games together. I would think a viral component is probably not the cause..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Spinal Cord Disorders

Atypical symptoms include: duration (longer than 12 hours), frequency (4 over 2 months' time), time (diurnal, not nocturnal), behavior (very still, not the thrashing and hitting characteristic of CH sufferers), and regularity (not predictable). Here goes: Possible Initial Injury Age six Fell from monkey bars while inverted, landing on neck, and subsequently, back Immediate effects were dazing and shortness of breath (wind knocked out of me) By the end of the school day, right shoulder was raised to ear level, due to muscle spasm Principal, who was chiropractor, painfully adjusted neck and recovery was made; principal stated a couple of cervical discs were out of alignment. Re-emergence of Pain Approximately age 13 to age 19 Neck was in awkward position while being buried in sand at the beach Symptoms were: sudden, sharp pain in right hemisphere of head, particularly on the top, right side of the skull, but also shooting up from its base and the neck; as the muscle relaxed, there was always a production of 1-3 tears in right eye ONLY I call these brain freezes Pain was quite brief, perhaps only ten or twenty seconds, and there were no lingering effects Occasional brain freezes like this were the norm for the next 5-6 years, occurring at irregular intervals, as infrequent as once per week but sometimes much more often Possible triggers were awkward posture/movement, muscle strain (neck), chewing gum (NOT food), barometric pressure (inducing a tension headache that could/can flare up) and stress, specifically moments of high stress of the level that causes an adrenaline dump, the spasm occurring immediately after the dump Notable exception to brevity characteristic: 17-day migraine that affected both hemispheres of head, and that was treated with chiropractic manipulation and subsequently, a spinal tap. Seen by Neuro in CHKD ED & diagnosed as atypical migraine. During evaluation, also received EEG & CT of head, both of which were negative. (Is this exception a possible red herring?) Modulation of Pain Approximately age 19 to present Unsure of initial trigger/injury Modulation initially consisted of intensification of pain during brain freezes and the production of a knot in the center of my right shoulder, which has never really quite resolved itself. However, after adjustment by another chiropractor (I really should learn my lesson, shouldn t I?) in an effort to relieve brain freezes, pain continued to intensify, and the spasms sometimes lasted longer and appeared more frequently. This is not to say that the original type of spasm no longer occurred, however. Triggers remained same as above. Intensity and frequency of normal tension headaches also increased, to the extent that they appeared to induce spasm activity in neck muscle, although the latter may cause the former This has been the case for approximately the last two years, and the only effective treatments have been a cherry pit pack and Excedrin. I usually take two of the latter in cases of moderate to high-moderate pain. It should also be noted that I sleep with a special pillow and only on my right side. Sleeping on my left side immediately results in my awakening with brain freezes. During this same time period, and up until approximately six months ago, I could adjust my neck after a spasm by forcing my head toward the left shoulder. This often produced multiple pops, as many as five or six at a time. This winter, however, I evidently injured my neck and shoulder further by doing this. After a particularly severe bout of spasmodic pain, while in the shower I attempted to self-adjust, apparently straining the offending muscle. For the next few days, the muscle was stiff and sore, and my right shoulder was drawn upward. This kind of drawing has re-emerged three or four times since, sometimes without apparent cause, but perhaps linked to physical exertion. Also, most frightening of all, I have seen an occasional exponential increase in the intensity and duration of these spasms, to the extent that I distinguish these occurrences from brain freezes, which I reserve for the more brief variety. Within the last month or so, on three occasions (EDIT: now, 4 occasions, including episode of July 28, which resulted in an ED visit) I have experienced agonizing pain (10 out of 10) across the right hemisphere of my head, lasting approximately 6 hours, 8 hours, and 10 hours respectively. The last two episodes were almost certainly induced by my sleeping posture: in both cases I fell asleep on the couch the night before. The pain has a particular spasmodic quality to it in that I am in constant pain, but the severity plateaus, increases to the level that I sometimes scream, and then gradually descends back to a more manageable level until the next spasm. These episodes are also characterized by a drawing of the left shoulder up toward the ear, although not to the extent of the drawing mentioned in the above neck injury. Excedrin has proven decreasingly effective against this level of pain. I also attempted to treat each of these headaches with a muscle relaxer, heat, and Aspercreme, none of which had any perceptible effect. In the final occurrence, which took place July 19, the only effective medication was a Darvocet, which finally seemed to relieve the majority of the pain. In its wake, however, I have had lingering spasms of varying intensity, along with muscle tightness in my shoulder. On each occasion, I have only been able to alleviate a small portion of the pain by kneeling, placing my head in my hands, and supporting my weight with knees and elbows. I can feel the muscles in my neck and shoulder contracting as the pain level crescendos, and I even noticed the muscles across my forehead contracting during on of the spasms. It should be noted that none of the above symptoms are accompanied by nausea, light/noise sensitivity, or any of the other classic migraine symptoms of which I am aware. It is my opinion that my problems are muscular or neuro-muscular in origin, particularly since a recent X-ray of my back showed no spinal issues, and since I do not fit the migraine profile. I have been known to be wrong, however. I can not exaggerate the severity of this pain. It is unbearable, intolerable, and after this last episode I live in fear that it will come back. I can not work, can not recreate, and in short can not enjoy my life. Even typing this summary excites miniature bursts of pain in my head. Being a diabetic, depending on medication to resolve the issue is not an option; neither is spinal surgery, at least for me. Ideally, I would like to pursue in this order: a therapeutic option that emphasizes conditioning of the offending muscle (s) in my shoulder and neck, trigger point injections, and botulism injections. With all that being said, I am definitely not a doctor, so I would appreciate all the help and information I can get..######-Brain & Nervous System###-Trigeminal Neuralgia

There were two main sources of blood pumping out of my hand when not being held shut, this went on for 8 hours, the nurses took shifts holding the arteries shut till the hand surgeon arrived. Once the surgeon arrived, they put me under and I believe they just closed it off, then scheduled me for another surgery 7 days later to reattach tendons and stuff, the surgery ended up taking 5 hours and apparently my tendons had shriveled back into my hand, so they had to make more cuts. The healing proccess was horrible, and I lost layer after layer of skin on about 70% of my hand which has yet to come back (its still shiny on my fingers and super sensative) (my fingers are noticably smaller than the other hand). I went to as many physical therapies as I could afford, which was n't many. I can no longer completely ball up my fist or open my hand fully due to tendon damage which I can deal with, but the numbness/pain/sensations in my fingers is getting very depressing. I can not feel stuff I touch, but when I do touch something, it sends sharp pains/pressure throughout my hand. My grip has been severely downgraded, and if I squeeze too hard, my hand feels as if it wants to burst open. I have to wear a work glove for anything I do.

It was immediately swollen, turned black and blue and hurt enough that I almost passed out. I gathered myself, continued to work but the pain remained for a few days. So, I had an xray, it came back negative, all the bones are ok. Now, three weeks later, my pinky finger and the one beside it are slightly numb, there is a hard lump that feels like it could be on one of the tendons in the palm of my hand. I can use the hand, but have trouble picking things up and gripping with the same amount of strength as my other hand. There is always dull pain from my wrist to fingers, and severe pain if something hits the lump. Three weeks later it is not getting any better, I can work, but it is effecting how productive I am and I really notice it when I go to bed at night so I ice it down. Does this sound like something that will go away with time, or should it receive some professional attention? Thanks so much. - Dave######Hello again all. It has now been over a month since the attack of the 2x10. The severe pain is gone, but I still have a lump about the size of a chick pea under my flesh on the palm side of my hand. Hand is still fairly weak, and it burns horribly when I try to grasp and pick something up. Is there anything a Dr could do for this ?? What does it sound like ?? I really do n't want to end up with the Dr bills, but I need my hands.######This will be my last attempt on the forum, hopefully someone has some input. Now about 2 months after the lumber stuck the palm of my hand, I still have the lump under the skin. New symptoms though, all the joints in my hand and fingers are rather tight, and several are pretty painful. If I hit any of the fingers above the lump I get a pretty intense ``electrical '' sensation. Guessing I did some nerve damage and a trip to the doc is inevitable. I am a contractor and do a fair amount of electrical work, the sensation is so intense that a couple of times I thought I shocked myself, but I was n't touching wires at the time. Anyway, I do have feeling in my hand and fingers, but a lot of pain and weird sensations. It has kept me awake a few nights.######yes you need to see a doctor. Probably you will need physiotherapy and some treatment for the inflamation. In the mean time here is a protocol you can follow for the affected area: R.I.C.E R = goes for rest I = goes for ice C = goes for compress E = goes for elevation It is good to apply ice for about 10 minutes at least three times a day when you are not using the hand, it will help with the inflamation, also take vitamin D which help with the pain for inflamation, but go see a physiotherapist. I am hopping that nothing is broken in your hand. Good luck to find a good/knowledgeble doctor.######You definitely NEED to see a doctor. You may have a hairline fracture that they missed. Something like this happened to my mother. She was walking around on a fractured foot (she dropped something on it) without knowing it till suddenly certain areas turned lumpy and black, and it was really painful when she walked. See a doctor and get it checked again. I 'm sure they 'll have answers for you this time around.######Hello reydav, I 'm just curious to see if you 've had any further problems with your hand. I fell in the middle of July, just over three months ago. I too, thought I 'd broken my hand. X rays said no, but around ten weeks later, I found lumps forming in the palm of my hand, my palm turns blue if I am cold, I now have numbness and tingling in my fingers and as with you, a considerably weaker grip than my other hand. My GP thinks I should wait another 6 weeks to see if it goes away on it 's own, but I 'm concerned I need it investigated sooner than that?

I 've been referred to the hospital byt nothing through yet and I 'm worried sick######jude, Lumps and bumps about the hand are very common. You do not say if the mass is in the palm or on the back of the hand. Lumps in the palm, at the base of the fingers, are usually either a nodule on the flexor tendon or an EIC (epidermal inclusion cyst). If it seems to move when you move the finger, then it is probably a nodule on the tendon. If it is fixed, it is more likely an EIC. The tendon nodules arise because of tenosynovitis of the tendon and tendon sheath. This can become large enough to get caught in the pulleys of the flexor tendon system. This can cause pain, catching, or even locking. EICs can press on structures around them, especially with grasping, causing pain, and decreased grip strength. Since the mass is bothering you significantly, you should probably have an evaluation by a hand surgeon. Good luck..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Orthopedics

In the wrist area when you turn your hand over.) It is still noticeably purple and the purpleish color extends up to the palm of my hand. Once again, I had fractured my wrist in 2 separate places. My cast has been off since October 22nd. My therapist measured my wrists and my right one was 6 ``3/4 and my broken one was 6 ``18/20. Slightly bigger. I also had a torn ligament. What are your opinions on this ?? Please help if you can. P.S. I also get an occasional crack noise that occurs when I bend my wrist. However, it does not hurt when it happens. Thanks######are you feeling any pain of any kind there?there are some conditions that could arise from the type of injury you recieved, but most come with some very extreme pain out of proportion to the extent of injuy.was this discoloration there before or is it new?any numbess or tingling there or around the area of injury?did they do an x ray when they removed your cast just to see how things were healing?this ALWAYS needs to be done upon cast removal. FB######They did take a X-Ray upon removing the cast. It did turn out healed. (But, my first x-ray for this, when I first did it. It barely barely showed anything and the dr. sent me to get a MRI. The mri showed I had 2 separate fractures (metacarpal and radius) and I also had a disrupted schaplunate ligament which is associated with a tear and something with the extensor tendons.) The discoloration was there when I got my cast taken off and it is still there today. I am having therapy for my wrist. When I was evaluated, I was credited with 2lbs of grip with my hand although it was just below 2lbs. I have a 47lb grip with my right hand. However, I do feel as if I am getting a somewhat stronger grip, but slowly. When I do my therapy, I have 3lb weights I use with the movement. Any pain I get is on the outer part of the wrist and it goes up to the palm of my hand. I also get the same feeling sometimes on the opposite side but it is just the outer part and does not go anywhere else. When I feel my hand with my fingers, there is a noticeable difference. I have like a small bump like thing on the top of my hand on the left side. I am supposed to be going back to the Dr. on the 13th for a checkup where he said he will send me for another MRI. I was reading about the torn ligament and it said somewhere near 3months in certain occasions it takes to heal. The doctor mentioned about possibly have some sort of small surgery for it. However, the doctor that performed my operation on my collarbone that was fixed by 8 screws and a plate feels different about it. He said it is something common (the metacarpal and radius fractures) and that I should give it 3 months and if it bothers me then go and get it checked out? <- haha.

I am not too worried about this but have so many medical issues I do n't want to bug my doctor with this. It took a while to figure out what was happening but over the last few months I have realised that an annoying stab like pain I get in my left testicle/groin area is directly triggered by pressure in a specific spot on my left hand. I simply had n't realised to two were linked initially. It 's a very sharp pain, just like a shock to the nuts, but stops immediately the pressure source is released. Happens often if I grip something tightly, happens virtually every time I change gear in the car, if I make a fist and dig the finger tips into my palm etc etc etc..

The glove caught the ground and rolled under me as my body slid across the ground. I felt, and others heard a loud pop. I was in a lot of immediate pain, and remained painful that night. The next day it was stiff and a little swollen. Took a few days to regain full mobility. It has mostly healed except for a few things that do n't seem to get any better. It is painful when i grip and twist things. And is the most painful if my hand is in a cocked position (like pushups). If I do pushups I get a cracking in the wrist, and it 's painful enough that I have to stop after just a few. Or if I try to lift something in that hand cocked back position. It also hurts when I put my hand down palm first onto the steering wheel when I drive, i feel like a pressure relief after a few bones seem to crack into place. It occasionally hurts when I open doors (turning the door knob), but does n't interfere with every day life to much. Just when I do the above mentioned movements. Not sure what this is as like I said it does n't hurt with normal movement really. Occassionally at rest I have a dull pain as well.######the pain is located in my left wrist, on the outside (closest to smallest finger side), right where the wrist joint is.######It sounds like you could have a TFCC injury.

Endodontist wants tooth pulled, help!.######-Dental###-Dental Health######Here 's the situation. I had root canal done on lower molar 15 years ago. Because of work done on it when i was a child, inside of tooth was ``calcified '' so dentist could not go through top of tooth, he had to go through the gums on the side. I started to have pain in that tooth again, but since it was n't constant, my dentist first attributed it to my grinding/clenching (i do wear a mouth guard on upper teeth for sleep), but xrays showed no infection. Pain continued, mostly at night. But eventually i got referral to endodontist. He tooth xray and said he thought he saw possible infection, so proceeded to go in and clean it up (again, through the gums, not through tooth). When he went in, he said it looked fine and stopped procedure, not wanting to damage tooth. When i returned a week later to remove stitches, he said that tooth should be extracted, because there probably was infection INSIDE of tooth, that was n't showing up in xray (or perhaps a hidden root with infection). I spoke to original dentist and shared my concern about not wanting tooth pulled ``on a hunch. '' I notice my tooth does n't really hurt like it did before procedure. I still chew on it, without pain. Usually i can start a tooth ache in evening, but i can sorta make it go away if i close my mouth and try to relax. That seems to work more often than not. I had some major face pain last week, which i think i can attribute to a sinus infection, because it mostly went away by last weekend. I still have some swelliing in the gum area where the surgery occured (it 's three weeks as of yesterday), so it 's kind of hard to figure out why my mouth does n't totally feel normal again. Is it my bite? Grinding/clenching? Should i just bite the bullet and have tooth extracted and risk that not being the cause of the pain? The pain is not constant, usually in the evening, and sometimes able to be ``willed away '' by relaxing... I 've just read about people dying from tooth infections, and do n't want to wait too long, but at the same time, do n't want to lose a tooth if no infection is visible in xrays (and after endodontist went in and saw a clean area). I would appreciate any input as i ca n't seem to find anyone with a similar situation anywhere on the internet. Thanks again!######Hi, if the endodontist told you to better to extract the tooth, go ahead and do it. Do not risk a dangerous infection over a tooth that you can replace with a partial or an implant or leave it missing. You can live very well witouht a molllar, I have.

About three days ago, the gum above it swelled up a bit, hurts, and will not go away. From what I have read, it is probably infected. I do not want to get another root canal, would it be probable to just get it extracted, or could that cause problems? I am 21, male, and currently on zero drugs, antibiotics, and no allergies.######Well, it can cause your sinuses to fall. Not the technical term, but a general description. Has your dentist tried just a round of antibiotics? Sometimes that will help-it depends on where the infection is. Having said that, I 'd prob still extract it if they do n't work, in my experience second root canals are a waste of money as the root is often cracked but they ca n't tell from X-rays. Ask about the sinus issue, but they can always do a lift if needed. Their are no guarantees in dental work and I personally can not afford to throw money at teeth that will prob have to be extracted any way. With a root canal you 'd lose the old crown anyway, and you can get an implant and crown for close to the same price as root canal and new crown..######-Dental###-Dental Health

It felt like dry socket but it was n't. Which was really weird that the pain is coming from my tooth that has a root canal in it. I got this root canal done over 5 years ago never had problems and just had a crown redone on it. I went to a dentist up where I go to college and he said on the x rays my sinuses are so cloudy he cant even see anything and is sending me to a specialist tomorrow to make sure its not a cracked root in my root canal. Im on three medications to take down the pain, swelling, and infection if its sinus related. I called my ent that called them all in for me until i can get home to see him. My question is i am freaking out because when i first got this root canal done i was younger and i told the dentist i could feel it and was in alot of pain and not numb enough he ignored me and i literally went through the whole procedure feeling the whole thing. When my parents picked me up i was as white as a ghost and I 'm scared for life now with any dental work. If my root is cracked in my root canal would i still be in alot of pain. I havent taken alot of pain killers i am due and its just a little sore. Also if it is a cracked root what does that mean i have to undergo another root canal or do they extract the tooth. it is my upper tooth# 18. I did n't know that sinus problems can make you feel like you have a bad tooth ache but i would think by now i started the medications last night that maybe I wouldnt have any pain but thats probably just wishful thinking. I am stressing majorly about this appointment i dont want to hear that my root is cracked i am praying its a sinus issue.

It is well-known for slowing the heart rate and normalizing electric rythms, so logic suggests it should have a positive, not negative effect on BP. IF it raises your BP, my immediate suspicion is an allergic reaction. Many people are allergic to seafood, and I am allergic to shellfish. I mention this, because a lot of ``fish oil '' is actually ``krill oil, '' a small shrimp, which would make an allergic person's BP go up. So (a) see what your fish oil really is, and (b) see if you have any allergies to seafood. tamuprof45######Thank You, Tamuprof45.

In fact, I try to make sure I have nutritious snacks between meals to keep my BP from going up so high. I can cut 10 or 15 points off my systolic peaks by eating a little something every few hours, rather than large meals at one time. But, as I recall, you are young, so you are not too likely to have PPH. From what I 've read, almost no one in their 20s has it. About one-third of ``the elderly '' have it- I presume that means those over 65. You could be one of the few exceptions, though, so you might want to check your BP before and after meals a few times on a weekend. I have read that eating regular meals, especially not skipping breakfast, was good for blood pressure in general, but ca n't remember now how authoritative a source that came from.######Hi Uff Dah !! Thanks for the reply- I wish I were in my mid 20's !!! I 'm in my late 30's in fact 39 !! Anyhoo, I 'm taking chlonidine .01 and lisinopril 20mg.

My mother takes Feledopine (err.sp ??) and it works very well with her. I 'm wondering if I should ask my doc the same. As far as snacking all day, I have been trying to eat much better.

I will try to see how eating throughout the day effects my BP. Thanks again for your helpful advise !! You 're the bomb !!!######My BP drops, but not a lot, if I skip a meal... it also drops a bit after most meals ??? What causes my spikes are anxiety and salt overdosing.

Aha, I checked and it exists as CATAPRES it 's available as a 24 hour patch. But, OY, the SUPER premium price of about$ 70 a month, whereas 60 tablets of .1, .2, or .3 mg. costs about$ 12. With a pill splitter the stuff is almost FREE. Anyhoo, they call it CATAPRES TTS-1, 2 or 3... depending on dosage. You put a new patch on every week. I 'm DYING to try clonidine, because the idea of something that makes me drowsy will maybe make for a nice sleeping pill/hypertensive combo. I; ll bring it up again at the doctor's and make CLEAR that I 'm NOT talking about KLONOPIN (that 's what the thought I said the last time)######Postprandial BP Reduction: Yesterday I had a huge plate of Pasta Carbonara (5 ounces of dry pasta/sauce made with eggs, sour cream, olive and canola oils and diced ham, washed down with 2 Pepsi ONE's for a total of 900 calories. I was stuffed to the gills and plopped into the recliner. On a whim, I tested my BP immediately... 114/71. It remained this low for almost 2 hours. I guess when the body diverts a lot of blood to the stomach, that secondary shunt takes a good share of the flow, thus lowering BP. Let's see, if I ate that 5 times a day, my BP would remain spectacular probably up to the point that the scale tops 500 pounds!######Delayed or skipped meals cause my BP to shoot up. After meals my BP drops so much that sometimes I 'm on the verge of fainting/faint. I 've only been taking BP tablets for two years (I 'm early 50s) but I 've always felt weak after meals so I suspect my BP was falling low especially after the mid day meal even when I was in my twenties. recently I 've measured my BP in this state after meals and had readings in the region of 78/45. Delayed meals produce a BP of 150/105. My doc has n't mentioned any of this. Should I?######On the subject of meals, I 'm wondering if my eating patterns could be affecting my evening blood pressure readings. Here 's a typical diet for me. Breakfast: 1 or 2 breakfast bars (Nature Valley, Honey Maid, etc.), 20-oz water, 12-oz green tea, multi-vitamin (this is usually taken 3 hours after initial wake-up.) Lunch: Subway foot-long sandwich (I usually get extra green peppers, onions, and jalapenos Dinner: Either a legume like lentils with Vienna sausages... or a salad with spinach, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and canned salmon (on workout nights, I usually eat after 9:30 PM) In between that, I usually drink several more glasses of water and another batch of green tea. I 'm wondering if I need to eat more during breakfast to help my bp during the evening. I may have to do some experimenting. I also think I may run around the house for 15 minutes when first waking up. Last night, my BP was 157/92 before my evening workout. I decided to work out anyway and when I checked it about an hour after working out, it was 135/86. Anyway we 'll see.######Rainbow- Definitely inform your doctor about this. The doctor only checks your BP in the office at a single point during the day and would have no idea of the seriousness of your postprandial hypotension unless you tell him. If the problem is already symptomatic in your early 50s, you could have some tough times ahead of you as you age, so you may want to at least minimize the effects as much as you can. Unfortunately, if you have an older doctor who has n't kept up with this topic, he may not know a lot about it, as it appears to me that almost nothing was known about this twenty years ago. And since there is no specific costly pill to solve the problem, I doubt the pharmaceutical companies would have done much to educate the doctors about recent knowledge in this area. Low carb eating will minimize the problem after an individual meal, but apparently does nothing longer-term. I suggest that you do some reading of the research on PPH to be aware of the possible problems involved. In my reading, I learned that in the elderly in nursing homes, they found that even strokes were associated with PPH. Here are a couple of references I found to get you started: http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/33/1/565 http://www.arclab.org/medlineupdates/abstract_11723147.html.######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

I notice mine drops to 90/60 after eating and sitting up straight while watching TV. It is normally in the standard 120/80 range. I do also notice that my heart beats faster after I eat. I also wonder if my heart beats faster because my BP drops and my ticker has to compensate. Or if my BP drops because my heart is beating faster and I no longer require the higher BP to supply blood to my organs. Hmmmm... I am 33 year old male 160 lbs.######Blood pressure dropping after eating is called, and it is actually a disorder. Increased heartrate IS included in this condition. It is said to occur 30 to 75 minutes after eating. What happens is that the body sends a great deal of blood to the intestines for digestion, and the body compensates for the shifted blood volume by increasing heartrate and lowering blood pressure. Postprandial hypotension is said to be caused by a defect in the nervous system, it not compensating properly when digestion takes place. Sometimes I experience this when I eat, but usually I do not. It typically happens when I go from an empty stomach to a very full stomach, or if I eat something very sugary on an empty stomach. I really have no idea how postprandial hypotension is treated, or if it is damaging in the longterm. If your symptoms are really bothering you, I 'd talk to your doctor and see if perhaps ph is really what you have, and how to fix it whatever it is.######I think mine falls a bit after a heavy meal... I guess I should never stop eating. No wait, I never DO, alas!.######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

It seems like my bp is quite low in the morning or late at night. I 'll check my pulse and the heartbeat is very faint on my wrist- the rate is normal, usually around 70 bpm. I eat one large meal a day (in addition to snacks) around noon, and during the time when I 'm digesting the meal, my pulse on my wrist is much more pronounced and I 'm usually up to 80 bpm. The pulse gradually gets less perceptible and slower as I digest my meal and by evening it 's low again. Anyway, has anyone checked their bp and pulse at the same time to see if this is an accurate predictor of bp?######Most home blood pressure monitors also record pulse at the same time. And no, a high pulse does not necessarily correlate with a high blood pressure. If you have no particular reason to believe you have a problem with blood pressure, you might want to check it periodically at a drug store. Be sure you rest a few minutes after sitting down, as if you have been walking around shopping, your BP will likely be higher than the normal resting BP..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Can being in a hot room alter BP readings? It 's hot where I live and I took my BP and it was 141/80. I 've been running at 119-125 over 70-80 the last couple of weeks. TIA######Oh and I just ate too. Does eating cause a BP spike too?######I do n't know if being in a hot room would cause it. I thought being in a cold room would, though. After most meals, my BP goes down. But occasionally, it will go up. I suspect those meals contain some food to which I 'm allergic. At any rate, I 'm keeping a list of foods I ate in such meals to see if I can determine which specific foods cause it.######Usually if you are in an overheated room (or even in a hot tub) blood pressure often will get because the heat causes your blood vessels to dilate, resulting in blood being more concentrated in your skin instead of your internal organs. That 's why we often feel lightheaded if we stay too long in a hot tub for instance. BP plunges! So the 141 ``spike '' might have more to do with having just eaten. I know that doctors prefer to take BP at a 1/2 hour before or after a meal. I would n't worry at all about the temp spike you had. Your average #s are terrific! zuzu xx######Hi redherring ~ I have always heard that heat makes our pressure lower. Last summer my son played in a 2 month baseball tournament in June and July ~ some days it was over 100! my bp did not go down ~ it was the same as usual. I did drink plenty of cold water and kept a wet bandana around my neck ~ so that hepled. Food DEFINITELY makes my bp higher. The worst spike I ever had (was just last week). It occurred after a hearty/salty meal and after I took a calcium tab on top of all the food. Scared the crud out of me. Since then ~ my meals are way smaller and less saltier. Im also eating slower. These are good habits for all to keep ~ especially those of us who have high bp-or spikes. Food and drink is a trigger of mine ~ and Im glad to be aware of it. Iced tea is my favorite beverage ~ but I drink decaff tea (and coffee) or I would be bouncing off the walls RR######I 'm with Uff-da; I find that a hot room always lowers my BP to a very nice, or super nice level. As zuzu explains, in order to lose heat the body dilates it 's skin's arterioles so the skin is flush with ``hot '' blood and the process radiates away. It 's analagous to opening all the spigots in an old house, the pressure falls. I find exactly in the winter: When I am chilly, my BP always soars... the skin circulation is shut down to a bare minumum. I have n't notice much change with eating normally but my BP goes up a little with a HUGE meal. I theorize that if the stomach needs extra blood-flow for digestion, it might well clamp down on the skin and brain... might also explain full-stomach-sleepiness.######Thanks everyone for the answers. I was stressed out yesterday. Running around my house and trying to eat at the same time. In addition, I absolutely detest heat (it 's a menopausal female thing lol). I 'm sure all of these factors played a role in spiking my BP. Now I need to NOT obsess over this one time spike!######I find that when I get hot and dehydrated in the summer heat that my heart rate and bp both go up some..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

I went on natural program such as no red meats noliquor no coffee coq10 hawthorne vit c, d, b6 rhodiola stress mune garlic exercise I have always exercised an am 5,10 '' was 210 am now 200lbs perfect weight would be 190 lbs I saw my BP go down to the 115/78 range on a regular basis 90% of the time staring in March. So I started eating more steak drinking wine a bit. For instance on Thursday I drank 1 bottle of wine and then the next day Friday drank 3-4 ccoffee. So on Friday night after drinking coffee I notice my BP was 160/105 and then Saturday morning 140/100. I am not as calm and have deflected from my very strict diet Can BP rise so high withhin such a short time. Right now I am hopefull because I did see my bp in the normal ranges for a few months. I have also been very stresssed with work again. I could almost see the BP riising as my work load was talking over. I have to learn to balance my stress. I am venting out here. maybe someone is in the same situatiion. I am just confused as to having consistent bp of 118/78 an then 160/100. Can a change of diet with someone who is anxiuos create a change that quickly and drastic i will return to my extreme diet to get the BP down as quickly as possible. I also forgot to mention the doctor saw a mildly dilated aortic valve. When i returned to see her she said it was so minimal based on the cardiac unit it would not nessisitate a return visit. I have also to this date balance issues when standing up. It seems to get worse when I am anxious. I am all over the place. I think I need to start writtting in my journal daily again as I am realizing that when I worked onmyself on got better and thenwhen I satrted feeling good i got lazzy with my lifestyle and now seem to be going backwards have a good day######190 lbs? Are you sure? I would think that about 170 lbs or less would be healthier. If I did that my blood pressure could be around 190/110. OTOH, I would love to down a bottle of wine, or a six pack of beer. No can do anymore. BP can go very high in a short period of time, depending upon what you come into contact with; or what you eat or drink. In my case, I have found that when my blood pressure used to get high and unhealthy, it would stay high for long periods of time. Stress is one of the many things that can cause an increase in blood pressure. Diet has a very strong effect, either negative or positive, not only on blood pressure but also on health. To me, the blood pressure is just a, which reflects the health of one's metabolism, kinda like an engine gauge of a car. Everyone is different, of course. If you are an elderly type, such as I, with a weaker immune system and metabolism, then it takes less to negatively effect the blood pressure, IMHO. Some people's blood pressures are very sensitive to negative influences. Sounds like a good plan. I have found that diet and exercise has an amazingly positive effect on blood pressure, health and well being. Have a good, low blood pressure, day yourself!######Very possible you have what I was just diagnosed ``Labile '' hypertension. Basically you are susceptible to dramatic changes in the blood pressure, although you are not hypertensive at all times. It 's somewhat a better diagnosis than essential hypertension, many doctors choose to not even treat it, others treat with beta-blockers or ccb's. Keep up the diet, exercise and im sure your episodes will last less.######Always great advice from Machaon and dantescritic. I concur. Your general health did n't suddenly change, your diet and anxiety did. And they are pointing out that 's better than a constant high BP because you can control with stress reduction, diet, etc.. It 's a setback and learning process. Doing this off meds requires vigilant action/attention. But the learning process is very valuable, if your learn from it. It just might be that steak does this. Maybe wine. But I suspect steak far more. Just ONE high fat meal has been demonstrated to flood the blood and arteries with fat and makes the arteries far less resilient to regulate BP. A high fat meal was found that it took the arteries far longer to return to normal condition/shape that it was in before the high fat meal, as a low fat meal. And the test was done on younger students! I guess you 'll know soon enough if the steak was it. But might be that plus the work stress. Managing stress and anxiety I 'm finding is the hardest part. It 's much harder then eating healthy and taking supplements. So I 'm planning to get a massage soon, it 's very relaxing. But you got to fight stress with a multifaceted approach. One stress reduction action helps, but just a little. But many different stress reductions actions combine over time and have a more effective synergy effect I think for fighting stress. Exercise being# 1 stress reduction action. But do other stress reductions actions as well. I had no idea how critical this was to managing health. take care.######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

I am thinking ``natural diuretics '' might be helpful to accelerate the process of purging the sodium from one's system, and so, I am trying something called ``water balance factors '' which in addition to potassium has vitamin B6, corn silk, elder flower, hydrangea root (is n't this toxic?) , uva ursi leaf, parsley, samphire fruit, and watermelon seed. I am also eating 4 stalks of celery, an old diuretic and BP treatment. I am not on prescription diuretics as you may guess. I suppose what I 'm asking is has anyone else had experience with quickly purging sodium or does the body just need to run its own course? My own OCD is such that whenever I eat a very salty meal I get paranoid I 'm going to have a stroke soon after... Thanks! tamuprof45######I think I 've mentioned this before, but I 'll mention it again. I notice no effect, whatsoever, on my blood pressure after eating a salty meal. Now, if I start down that slippery slope of eating junk ALL the time, that typically leads to not working out and a few weeks in I 'll see my BP numbers start to creep into a pre-hypertensive range. But, a purely salty meal does not raise my BP at all. Now, sometimes if I drink too much, I 'll get a bit bloated and my diastolic tends to raise a bit for a few days... like 120/85 or something. As far as natural diuretics, I 've always been told to drink tons of water w/lemon as well as coffee. It should flush the body out nicely in a day or so. I would say, with almost certainty, that you will not stroke out from occasionally having a junky meal.######one junky meal will not raise ur bp, consecutive salty meals will######Remember you have to have a clot for the kind of stroke most of us are at risk for so make sure you drink 8 glasses (8oz) throughout the day & take aspirin to prevent a clot if your Dr. approves. Get plenty of exercise to keep the blood moving. Do n't eat too much protein especially meat which would contribute to forming a clot. Allow yourself to have a salty meal from time to time. It 's the deprivation that does the most harm by motivating a person to seek out what we are trying to avoid. Fam######Just reading this topic makes me think how crazy we really are. Worrying about one meal? Thank god i 'm not that crazy about things yet, lol but i 'm getting there! I have a feeling none of us are going to have any problems with strokes or anything like that. Only cause we are so worried about it and we always go to the doctors to get checked out! It 's always the people who do n't pay attention that have problems. LOL that was so easy to post! yet i 'm always worrying about it all the time.######Exercise. Sweating gets rid of a ton of sodium, which is why (as I understand) drinks like gatorade have a lot of sodium. My Doc also said that overall sodium will only affect your BP by a couple of points. I 'm sure it 's different for different people, but in people, I 'm sure that sodium is not going to cause a life-threatening spike in BP. I eat low sodium for BP benefits, but I also found that it just helps me to eat healthier overall. So, regardless of the benefits I might get from reduced sodium, I 'll grab some fruit instead of a bag of pretzels, and that 's undoubtedly good for me..######-Heart-Vascular###-High & Low Blood Pressure

Severe reactions & damage are happening to many people. Many of them unaware that their solution is causing similar but a new host of problems. I am suffering with gastritus and have had the worst year of my life physically since taking prilosec. Many years ago I had reflux from a high stress job and coffee, etc.. After a parent died, and a severe reflux bout, I did n't understand reflux. No one explained eating lots of small meals. . or laying down on an incline, or sitting up three hours after you eat. . or cutting out wine, chocolate, sauce, spices coffee. . though I figured some of that out. Instead I too Nexium for SIX Months... fearing to get off it. . but I couldnt stop the nerves I had and my mother realized it WAS the medicine. So I stopped and slowly got back to normal. . that was in my 30s. Flash forward... some reflux again in my 40s... I find out I have POLYPS in my gallbladder. . WHY? welll reading on reactions it says some users get stomach polyps too! . Not good. But not realizing I took Prilsec again for two months. Older and more vulnerable to reactions, I went by ambulence for TWICE for the first time in my life after taking prilosec. I also had a knot under my stomach that got worse and worse. . all the while thinking it safe and not strong enough for reflux going wild. . NOT REFLUX THOUGH. . it was Gastritus! far worse. . ruining my digestive system. Soon I was unable to drive... !! totally a basket case physically and mentally. Then I could n't sleep... SLEEP APNIA !! digestion impossible at night a NIGHTMARE. Weeks off the prilosec and I could walk outside take a shower more confidently but the rumbling in my stomach made my sides hurt for MANY months and I felt like I had to hold the walls when walking down stairs... !! insane I know I was an athlete and this really ruined my year. Friends drove me around for months. . and then slowly helped me drive again. . with them in the car. My arm and fingers were getting numb after eating. Spice would make me feel like I could pass out! But it was just pressure. I still can not get up in the morning and not need to eat quickly or I will face horrible gastritus making me feel like I could pass out. Heart is good. . every test... moniter, you name it... Endoscopy all good no hpylori, no woman cancers... all checked... even a head scan. . all ok but now I am radiated! oh well thanks for the additional risk factor. It was prilosec and the generic equivalent being dished out by doctors who think they need to give you something for you to want to go there. The FDA has been aware of the over the counter and prescription PPI's (omeprazole and other similar names) and they are not properly warning people. REAL DAMAGE is being done to countless people Please google prilosec ruined my life. . where a college kid was totally messed up by it. Also google prilosec reactions etc.. Pills like this can suddenly turn and cause damage that you wouldnt even realized. . they are not innocuous !! they are hurting the people of this country and nothing is being done about it.######Sorry you have had such a bad reaction to PPIs, Tkcli. Have you seen a GI doctor about all this? It may be you have some other underlying condition. The fact is PPIs are saving lives. Yes, as with all medication there are side effects but get the right PPI (there are about 8 different ones to choose from) and the right dosage and if your problem is excess acid (as for the majority of people with GERD) they will solve the problem and prevent the progression to Barrett's Esophagus and possible Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. I know a number of esophageal cancer survivors- and, unfortunately, some esophageal cancer widows, who would give anything to turn the clock back and have taken PPIs before it was too late..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Acid Reflux

Granted I take 2 40mg pills daily, but they work. Today I got a letter in the mail from united health care stating that starting sept. 1st, they will no longer cover nexium due to over the counter pills available. Now I 'm worried I wo n't find something that works as well. Any thoughts?######i was sent the same kind of letter for protonix from my insurance there is a way around this mine was toi have the doctor write a letter and send it into the insurance stating this this is the only med you can take otc do n't work as effective as script meds######Did your United Health Care Plan use Medco as the mail-away pharmacy? Are all United Health Care Plans the same- can we all expect to get this letter? It took me 6 months to get approved for Nexium 2x a day when I switched insurance a year ago due to all of Medco and United's screw-ups. Now they want to drop Nexium? Are they planning on dropping all prescription PPIs? I know that every time I get my order in the mail, it comes with a letter asking ``Did I know that Prilosec OTC is now available cheaply? ''######i would imagine that alot of people can expect this kind of letter my insurance was champva i sent my scripts into the goverment i was a disabled vets wife and they did it so i would imagine the private insurance company's are gon na follow######I just called up United Healthcare and they confirmed they are dropping Nexium as of 9/1/2006. They do not have the replacement drug list available yet. This decision can be appealled by the individual. You or your doctor can write the appeal letter, which needs to contain:- Patient Name- Patient Subscriber#- Name of Medicine and Strength- Patient mailing address- Telephone Number- Doctor's Name and Telephone Number. The letter should be mailed to: United Healthcare Appeals P.O. Box 659773 San Antonio, TX 78265 Do n't forget to send it certified! (Not required, but I 'd recommend it)######I took Nexium for about 7 weeks or so and became concerned that taking it much longer could cause more problems. I 'm off Nexium now for about 12 days and I 've only had to take a total of about 6-8 Tums! Nexium may have fixed... something. Do n't get me wrong, I 'm still watching my diet... and I still have some of the throat clearing during the day. I 'm trying the probiotics that a friend suggested-maybe that 's helping. I figure, even if the GERD returns down the road-I 've given my system a rest from the drugs that basically shut down what the stomach needs to properly digest food. I think that 's important to do WHEN POSSIBLE.######Prilosec (omeprazole) and Nexium (esomeprazole) were both originally developed, patented, marketed and sold by AstraZeneca. So, It is probably the closest related PPI on the market-- NOW. When Prilosec came off patent in 2001, AstraZeneca patented the other purple pill Nexium-- was widely promoted, advertised and sold. This was done to make money in the$ 8.9 billion PPI market. There is not alot of dfference between the 2 drugs-- according to Stanford's drug watch person-- Robert Stafford, MD, PHD. But, Nexium does not have to be compared to another PPI only to a placebo for it to get FDA approval. I think what I have read Nexium is 6 to 8% stronger than Prilosec. Harry######you know if i have seen an add from AstraZeneca that if you ca n't afford your meds there is a number you can call and they will base it on your income at little to no cost######I have been on nexium for a couple of years now. I am also on probiotics for constipation but someone stated that probiotics may help your reflux. My refulx is unrepairable so nexium wo n't help but it will help the acid backing up. I wonder if I should try and get off it and try the prelosic again along with the probiotics and see what happens. Prelosic helped but I was getting flutters between my throat and chest. I had a stress test so it was n't that. Anyone had flutters? I too recevied a letter from United Health Care but our company just switched to Aetna on 8/1. I wonder if I am going to get a letter from them now. Thank God I sent for another prescrip before we switched. I have at least a 4 months supply left. Deb in CT######Hello, I am having the same problem. My insurace (Healthnet) is not letting me go for Nexium. Nexium was very effective for me in the past. Now, based on the suggestion of the Doc I am using Prolisec 20MG (OTC) but it is not at all effective. We pay so much money for the insurance and this is not fair that they do not let us get what is needed and what works for us. Is there any way that we can convince the insurance companies to let us get Nexium. Also, is there any other medications that are closer and as effective as Nexium as posted in the question of this topic. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks######Prilosec and Zegred both have the same active ingredient as Nexium- Omperazole. Also, both are availible in 40mg pills/packets.######You probably need 2 of the 20mg Prilosecs to get the same dose you were getting on Nexium.######You probably were not take 20 mgm dose of Nexium-- probably 40 mgm-- So, you may need the same dose of Prilosec ?? I hope this works for you ~ ~ ~ Harry######I 've been reading almost every post on this board for over a year and I have yet to hear of any poster state that Prilosec OTC worked for him/her. This is the Acid Reflux board, for god's sake. If it worked, we would be crowing about it. Prilosec OTC is not an adequate substitute, even for prescription prilosec. Something is going on with the production of the OTC stuff. Theoretically, 2 Prilosec OTC capsules should be the equivalent of one Nexium- but it just does n't work that way in practice. I have LPR- and I got even sicker when I briefly switched from Nexium to Prilosec OTC. I developed new symptoms on OTC that I never even had before starting Nexium (before diagnosis). I was on the OTC for 2 months and ran screaming back to Nexium.######Good point. Everyone I know that has tried prilosec OTC has hated it.######prevacid works good i 've used both.Pepcid ac in a pinch.Baking soda and water in a worse pinch######I just started OTC and actually I feel worst than without taking any PPI. I was on Nexium and it suddenly stopped working or so I thought. Increased belching, chest pains, PVCs. Stopped taking Nexium I actually felt better. I guess I was n't meant to take PPIs.######Prilosec OTC relieves my heartburn, but the side effects are so awful that I stopped taking it. Now, Pepcid AC is n't strong enough.######Am I correct that there is a difference between Prilosec and Nexium in that the latter has the added ingredient to aid in the treatment/repair of damage to the esophagus; weheras the former only reduced the amount of acid produced? I also received the letter fro UHC stating the two drugs are ``therapeutically equivalent ''- but, if Nexium also fixes damage to the esophagus I question the equivalence they are referring to. . or perhaps I am a victim of marketing######Rob, Both Nexium and Prilosec are proton pump inhibitors-- reduces stomach acids-- only. Both were patented by the same company-- AstraZeneca a london based company. Prolosec's patent expired in 2001 and Nexium patent started in 2001. It was done to capitalize on the big PPI market. Neither have anything added to heal a damaged espphagus. Nexium just cost more because it is a brand name product and not a generic. For some people Nexium works better and for others Prilosec works better for acid refux. Both have side-effects that affect some people differently ?? Harry######Yes my insurance told me I needed to try a generic or something else. They would n't let me get Protonix, Nexium, etc. anymore but now that time has passed they are letting me have some more. I think they allow you 3 before they cut off your supply again and request doctor authorization that you need it and have tried everything else known to man first. Well I stopped taking the Nexium ages ago because I figured that it would n't be good on my stomach to take it ``long term '' and indeed I was fine if I watched my diet and such for a long time. Last summer I had a flare up and started taking Protonix and they stopped paying for it so my doctor put me on the generic Omperozole 20mg (I always take 40mg of whatever) and lately my flare up got so bad that I have missed work. I tried Protonix and that did n't seem to work well so I went back to Nexium now and I just have that feeling after 3 months when I go to pick up the prescription they will try to charge me full price. Prevacid gave me uncontrollable dirreaha and Prilocec OTC did absoultely NOTHING for me! I think the insurance companies have deals with certain drugs companies too. Surely they are n't concerned with my health of taking it long term since they are allowing me generic (so far) etc.. Although I have more medical bills if they pulll things like this. We pay so much for insurance and then they treat us like this! I do n't like the idea of using it long term but I want the option of using it and having some help pay for it. It still cost me$ 40 for a 30 day supply of 40mg! My brother's insurance he gets about 3 months for$ 60 which is better..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

I am on Prilosec was on 40 mg a day, for 12 wks, then down to 20 mg. Started having problems with reflux, so back up to 40mg a day, and had burning acid in throat one night while sleeping very bad. So I have been using a uncomfortable wedge pillow. My GI doc put me on 80 mg Prilosec a day !!!! I weigh 105 lbs, and already have side effects from Prilosec on the dosage I am on now. Is this too much prilosec to take a day, and he said indefinately ??? Any experiences out there ???######I, just this afternoon, had a FEESST test performed (Gag!) and as a result my doctor is changing my meds from Prilosec 40mg's a day to Nexium 80mg's a day.######Oh Wow, so you will also be on 80mg a day. I thought about trying Nexium after the 1st of the yr, I ``ve heard it 's one of the best out there.######It is but it is very expensive and most insurance will not cover it without a specific diagnosis with supporting evidence of necessity. The tech. that performed my test today said that my condition warrants the need for Nexium and that the doctor would be sending this request to my insurance carrier.######Not all acid pills work the same. I tried nexium and it did n't do a thing. Neither did protonox. The only thing that worked for me was prevacid. Will your doc give you samples of other drugs to see if those will work better for you? I got off of prevacid. I went to a health store and went into the digestive section and found a ton of natural acid reflux stuff. I just pulled a bottle off the shelf and have stuck with these pills for a few months now and they work great. My reflux is pretty bad. I get reflux if I eat or drink anything. As long as I take my new pills I 'm fine.######PPI ``S are hard for me to tolerate, they just seem to make me feel worse.######So are your natural acid pills still working for you? I may try that route eventually, because I have Barretts my GI doc says I have to stay on PPI ``S, but I have read they can cause many other problems, besides the newest problem with fractures, they also cause me some anxiety and irritability. How can an acid pill, not for your head, cause these mental disturbances, I even had a hallucination one night watching tv. I know I did not imagine this, i 've heard others having the same, and it 's listed under rare side effects, which I 'm starting to think are not so rare.######These types of medications can definitely cause central nervous system disturbances. These disturbances could cause injury to you though and I would contact your doctor about the serious side effects you are experiencing. He may need to change the medication or the dosage. What good is it to get rid of the reflux if the side effects are even worse? With other options out there and other types of medications I would definitely call your doctor. Good Luck. God Bless.######Yep my natural pills are still working. There are so many to choose from. If one does n't work do n't give up try another.######I forgot to mention something. I just started taking alfalfa a couple of weeks ago and it has helped a lot too. My other pills would work great during the day time but I would get reflux at night sometimes. Now I take alfalfa a couple of hours before going to sleep and now I do n't have night time reflux anymore..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

And I know it 's safe to take certain over the counter acid pills with it, like Zantac, but I do n't know if it 's safe to take two prescriptions like that together, you might call your pharmacist and ask, but I do n't think that is going to help matters. Try something your allowed to take with it instead. Gerd should not cause yellow mucus, more likely you have an infection your not getting rid of. These things more likely cause that: sinus infection, cold or flu, allergy reaction, bronchitis. Maybe you need a sinus CT scan and some allergy testing, they can do a CBC to look for a bacterial infection.######It can take a few days to start working. Try not to stress too much. Is it dangerous to take both at once? Probably not, not unless you get up to completely outrageous doses. However, if the PPIs just are n't helping, you may need a different approach..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

Is that even allowed? Any luck? Thanks######You and I have chatted. I also posted you a reply under my post. Please, please do not increase your prevacid! Give the digestive enzymes some time to help and work first. I did take 2 prevacids a day for 2 years. Im telling you, PPI's can be such bad news for some people and I am definately one of them. Before you increase it though (if you do), check with your dr first. Nancy######Nal, I read your other posts, and it appears that you were on Prilosec for quite a while. I have yet to find another LPR sufferer for whom Prilosec has been effective- it 's a much weaker PPI than Nexium, for instance. I 'm not saying it does n't have the possibility of working, but I did try 2 doses of Prilosec a day (in place of my Nexium) for 5 months a few years ago, and all of my LPR symptoms came back (at maybe 65% of what they had been before any medication). I did this because I had heard that Prilosec was very similar to Nexium, and it was definitely cheaper. But I felt so horrible, and was so sick, that I went back on Nexium 2x a day and all my sympoms resoved within 2 days. The realtity is that Prilosec simply did n't work my LPR, and I suffered terribly while taking it- and yes, I gave it plenty of time to work. There really is no such thing as ``rebound effect '' when you stop taking PPIs. If you have LPR, you likely have it for life, so if you stop your meds, of course you are going to have symptoms again. I also tried the probiotic route before I started Nexium. I had not been able to secure a diagnosis, so I went to a naturopath who thought I had digestive problems. He gave me probiotics, magnesium, etc. (all the same stuff that other users have tried) and it was completely ineffective. Perhaps they make good supplements to someone taking PPIs, but I do n't think they really treat the cause of this disease- the loosened esophageal spinchter muscles, that allow acid to splast upwards. Nal, my experience on Prilosec was definitely ``horrible ''. But have you ever given Nexium a chance?.######-Digestive & Bowel###-Acid Reflux/ GERD

I take mine in the morning and if I 'm having a lot of pain or reflux I take another before dinner. I do this only on the advice of my doctor. I also take Pepcid or Gaviscon during the day if I have a lot of burning or eat the wrong thing.######I took Nexium every day for about 6 weeks, then switched over to Aciphex, which is very similar to Prilosec. Personally I prefer the Aciphex because the Nexium gave me terrible bone pain and cramping in the lower back. I 've taken the Aciphex every day for about 2 months and so far it has worked fine. I do n't know how much longer I can safely be on it, but my GI doc knows I take it each day and so far he seems to believe it is for the best. If I were you I 'd go with the Prilosec. Good luck!######They both work basically the same way. It really depends on how your body likes the medication. You mentioned sticking to nexium, since it heals erosions. The Nexium heals erosions by lowering your acid production so their is less acid to cause erosion. Prilosec works the same way. Prilosec and Nexium are made by the same company. The patent protection is about to be or already has expired on the prilosec so other companies can start making generic prilosec. The ppis are huge money producers so the company basically repackaged the prilosec and called it nexium. I do n't think there is really much if any differece between the two. However, you will see that people react differently to the two so something must be different..######-Digestive & Bowel###-Digestive Disorders

Blood sugar can be controlled in a diabetic with the use of medication like insulin, metformin etc.. In non-diabetics your body will maintain the level by itself. Diabetics depending on type, eat a low carbohydrate diet, limit sugar intake, exercise regularly and take medication to keep their glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Long term blood glucose is measured by a blood test called an hba1c test, this measures your blood and gives a result of what your average level has been over 120 days, it works because every 120 days your body renews your blood, as long as you have not lost a considerable amount of blood in that time it will show what your average is, a normal hba1c level is under 6. Carbohydrates and sugar raise the glucose (sugar) in your blood, in normal people your pancreas will secrete natural insulin to maintain a normal level in your blood, the normal level depends on what you have eaten, time of day, time after a meal etc. excise lowers blood sugar because your body will burn the glucose (turns it into energy) If you suspect you have high blood sugar go to see a doctor, if you have blurred vision, always thirsty, urinate a lot you could have diabetes which can be fatal if not treated. Treatment for diabetes is fairly simple so get checked out..######-Conditions and Diseases###-Diabetes
