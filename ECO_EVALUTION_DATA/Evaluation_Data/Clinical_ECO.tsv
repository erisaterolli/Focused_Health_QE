ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03999502 First Posted : June 26, 2019 Last Update Posted : June 26, 2019 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Erasme University Hospital Study Description Go to  Brief Summary: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients. However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure. The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Approximately 250 million subjects worldwide and 30 million subjects in the US suffer from GERD. Among the 12 million Americans who suffer from daily heart-burn (the main symptom of GERD) almost 5 million do not respond completely to medications and many more do not want or cannot take medications due to side-effects (1). The goals of treatment in GERD are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis if present, prevent recurrence of symptoms and esophagitis, and prevent complications. Medical acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) heals esophagitis, relieves symptoms and improves quality of life. However, acid suppressive therapy does not correct the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter and hence symptoms of reflux due to weakly acidic or non-acid reflux persist in the majority of subjects who present with symptoms persisting on PPIs (regurgitations) (2). Abnormalities in the structure and function of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) such as a permanently open EGJ, a hiatal hernia, a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and transient LES relaxations (t-LESR) are the main pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to GERD (3). Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients (4,5). However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure (6,7). The results reported from operations performed in community hospital lower volume centers have been different than those achieved in centers of excellence. It has been reported that between 23% and 62% of patients who have undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication use acid suppression medications at long-term follow-up. Due to these issues patient and physician acceptance of surgical procedures remains low and is mainly limited to patients with severe GERD or those non-responsive to medications. For these reasons, less invasive endoscopic techniques to treat GERD have been developed during the last 2 decades, which may be categorized into 3 groups: (1) sewing/plication at the cardia and EGJ, (2) radiofrequency (RF) thermal therapy to the LES, and (3) injection/implantation of biopolymers at the EGJ. Minimally invasive endoluminal procedures for GERD are designed to provide long-lasting symptom relief and abolish or lessen medication dependency. Most endoluminal modalities that were introduced into clinical practice have failed due to lack of long-term efficacy, complications, or interruption of commercialization due to financial difficulties of the companies that developed the techniques (8,9). Endoscopic sewing/plication techniques comprised mucosal plications (Endocinch) that were not clinically useful because the plications were not durable, and full-thickness (serosa-to-serosa) plications allowing prolonged durability (NDO Plicator device and Esophyx device). The data from the RCTs with Plicator device were encouraging and the finding of better results with multiple plications without an increase in adverse events supported that this device could have clinical utility. However, the company ceased operations in 2008 and the device is no longer clinically available (10). Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) using Esophyx showed promising results in open studies (11). However, long-term follow-up revealed that a majority of patients required either ongoing PPI use or were referred for LNF owing to persistent symptoms (12). Endomina-v2 (Endo Tools Therapeutics SA, Rue Auguste Piccard 48, 6041 GOSSELIES, Belgium) is a CE marked device that can be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows manipulation of angulated tools during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibility to perform transoral surgical full thickness sutures and transoral endoscopic gastroplasty has shown to be safe and effective at mid-term follow-up in obese patients (13). The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use.

Other: Analysis of gastric juice Analysis of gastric juice including routine, biochemical and microbiological analysis. Other Name: Routine,biochemical, microbiological analysis Detailed Description: Functional dyspepsia (FD) and acid/bile reflux disease are common. These diseases share similar clinical manifestations. Individuals with functional dyspepsia (FD) often present upper abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, early satiety, loss of appetite, and no organic factors underlie it. Individuals suffering from acid/bile reflux disease often complain heartburn, upper abdominal burning or discomfort. What is more, there are always no specific changes on traditional endoscopy that can be used to differentiate these diseases (except erosive esophagitis). Though proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test is frequently applied to confirm the diagnosis of acid reflux disease, but certain amounts of individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not show favorable response to PPI test. In order to make a distinction of these diseases, esophageal pH-metry is needed, however it is not always available in most clinics. Recent data showed that new endoscopic technology such as Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging could demonstrate indistinct lesions caused by GERD which are not detectable by standard endoscopy, subsequently improve endoscopic diagnosis of these diseases. In addition, simultaneous analysis of gastric juice can help to determine whether bile reflux is present or not. As it is known, pathologic refluxes underlie not functional dyspepsia but acid/bile reflux disease. Hence, it is hypothesized that Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging in combination with simultaneous analysis of gastric juice could be used to differentiate functional dyspepsia from acid/bile reflux disease.   Eligibility 18 Years to 75 Years Genders Eligible for Study:

Drug: Guided therapy group Receive Dexlansoprazole 30 mg daily for GERD, 60 mg daily for GERD with erosive esophagitis for 8 weeks and Theophylline SR 250 mg daily for functional chest pain for 4 weeks. Other Name: Dexlansoprazole and/or Theophylline SR Detailed Description: Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is very common in the general population but symptom alone or patient's characteristics do not adequately differentiate cardiac and esophageal cause. Cardiologists are usually consulted first to exclude life-threatening acute coronary syndrome. Tests that are performed to exclude ischemic heart disease include exercise stress test and the more invasive coronary angiography. A negative stress test or angiogram or the presence of mild blockage of a single vessel disease will usually be adequate to exclude significant ischemia as a cause for chest pain. The next most important cause of unexplained chest pain would be gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD and its complications of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma have increased markedly in recent decades, not just in the developed countries but also in Asia. Although relatively less common among populations in Malaysia, there are data to suggest an increasing prevalence of reflux disease largely a result of obesity and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Dexlansoprazole (Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Japan) is a novel dual delayed release system recently approved by the FDA for treatment of heartburn associated with non-erosive and erosive reflux disease. It is unknown if dexlansoprazole is effective as an empirical therapy for NCCP. Another approach would be therapy guided by investigations including high resolution (HR) esophageal impedance manometry and 24-hour pH-impedance studies. Study of esophageal function has greatly evolved with the recent availability of high resolution multi-channel solid state manometer and impedance. Water swallows are commonly used in esophageal manometric studies to evaluate for peristaltic abnormalities. Esophageal pH monitoring does not detect all gastroesophageal reflux (GER) events but with the combination of impedance, this technique allows detection of GER of gas and acid or non-acid liquids. These tests would enable diagnosis of GERD and functional chest pain and thereby allow targeted therapy. For treatment of GERD, dexlansoprazole is effective and for functional chest pain, nonspecific adenosine antagonist, theophylline is proven to improve symptoms in patient with hypersensitive esophagus. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is also effective for functional chest pain , however it is not known if theophylline is more effective than any other SSRIs.It is unknown about the response rates based on the guided therapy approach compared to the empirical PPI therapy. Therefore, the aim of the intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness of empirical therapy vs. guided therapy on symptoms unexplained non-cardiac chest pain.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of GERD among college students in southwestern Saudi Arabia and to evaluate its personal, academic and stress correlates Materials and Methods: Through a cross-sectional study design, a self-reported questionnaire was distributed between a representative sample of students in health and non-health care colleges in southwestern Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included data for personal characteristics, academic study, and Arabic versions of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ) and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale. Condition or disease Other: no intervention Detailed Description: Study design and setting A cross-sectional study was carried out in both male and female campuses of King Khalid University (KKU) during the academic year 2018-2019. The University is located in Aseer region in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia. The area of Aseer region is about 80.000 square kilometers occupied with more than 1.6 million people. The university comprise 5 health colleges and 24 non-health colleges with a total number of 60.312 male and female students in the academic year 2014-2015. Target population Students in Health and non-health care colleges in KKU were the target population. Sample size and sampling method Sample size was estimated by using Epi info program version 7.2 with the anticipated prevalence of GERD symptoms among college students 23.8% [6], 95% confidence level and acceptable margin of error of 2.5%. The calculated cluster size was 1113 students. To account for the possibility of non-response, 1200 students were targeted from each of health and non-health care colleges. All health care colleges were included in the study. They were colleges of medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing and applied medical science. Five non- health care colleges were selected by random method. They were colleges of education, science, humanities, administrative and financial sciences, and languages and translation. Participants were selected through stratified cluster sampling technique. Within each college, students were stratified by academic level. Within each level a cluster (section or study group) was selected. When possible, all registered students within each cluster were included. Study tool and data collection A self-reported questionnaire was distributed personally by medical students-during their training in community medicine course- between the participants. The questionnaire includes the following sections: a) personal data such as, age sex, marital status, smoking status and family income; b) academic data which include, name of college, academic level and Grade point average (GPA); c) Arabic version of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ)[10]; d) Arabic version of Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [8]. All incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Arabic version of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ) GerdQ is a valid questionnaire used to explore the probaility of GERD. It is consisted of 6 questions as follow: four positive questions to assess GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, sleep disturbance related to heartburn and regurgitation and use of medications) and two negative questions (epigastric pain and nausea). Each item rated from 0 to 3 depending on the rate of symptoms over the previous week. GERD was detected with a total score value of 8 or more [10]. Score value of 8 or more plus total score value of 3 or more for the impact questions (sleep disturbance and use of medications) indicted GERD with impact on daily life. The Arabic version of GerdQ was developed and validated for use among Arabic speakers [11]. Data analysis The gained data were entered, revised, and analyzed using SPSS, version 22 software package. Grading of PSS into low, moderate and high was according to Cohen's et al [12]. Crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) were calculated using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis respectively. Their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to identify significant factors associated with GERD among students. Study Design Go to  Layout table for study information Study Type :

Verified October 2010 by University of Pavia. Recruitment status was  Recruiting First received: October 27, 2010 Last updated: October 27, 2010 Last verified: October 2010 How to Read a Study Record   Purpose Numerous clinical and experimental data show that the elective treatment of diabetic nephropathy should be based on drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Albuminuria is a marker of risk not only renal but also cardiovascular and diabetic patients with concomitant non-diabetic nephropathy, on the other hand, drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system available so far, namely ACE inhibitors and angiotensin antagonists II have proven effective in reducing proteinuria in power even if different therapeutic drug to drug. ACE inhibitors are one of the most known and used treatment options for blocking the renin-angiotensin system in patients with microalbuminuria. Drugs such as enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril are standard therapy in diabetic patients with micro or macroalbuminuria. However, it is still unclear whether their efficacy is, from this point of view, the same or varies from drug to drug. This is particularly true in the diabetic microalbuminuria, a condition in which there is sufficient documentation to prove that ramipril is effective. The main objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and trend of the time and to the antiproteinuric effect of antihypertensive 10-20mg/die imidapril versus ramipril 5-10 mg / day in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.

ACE inhibitors have a long half-life and offer the advantage of a single daily dose, usually empirically taken in the morning. Objective: We assessed the influence of time of administration of ACE inhibitors on circadian BP control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with stage 1 hypertension. Methods: Twenty T2D patients (9 being women) with a mean age of 58.7 years, diagnosed with stage 1 of hypertension and naive to BP lowering medications, were included. They were randomly allocated to receive perindopril 10 mg/day as a monotherapy either in the morning or in the evening for 28 days, with crossover without washout period on day 29th and additional 28 days follow-up. A 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline, days 28 and 56. Study Design Go to

Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards). Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) incidents reported between the two groups [ Time Frame: 3 years ] Collection of all non-fatal MI's reported between the two groups will use the log rank test for comparison of outcomes. Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards). MI definition follows universal criteria for Types 1-5 MI events. Specifically, the use of the ""Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction"" detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values, with at least one value >99th percentile upper reference limit and preferred biomarker is Cardiac troponin (cTn). Stroke/TIA incidents reported between the two groups [ Time Frame: 3 years ] Collection of all strokes or transient ischemic attack (TIA) reported between the two groups will use the log rank test for comparison of outcomes. Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards). The stroke definition is new onset neurological defect of central origin confirmed by brain imaging (CT or MRI) evidence of cerebral infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage. The definition of TIA is the same as stroke except no confirmation by brain imaging, but confirmed by a neurologist consult. Hospitalizations for cardiovascular events reported between the two groups [ Time Frame: 3 years ] Collection of all hospitalization for cardiovascular events reported between the two groups will use the log rank test for comparison of outcomes. Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards). Cardiovascular causes includes accelerated angina, persistent angina, unstable angina. Hospitalizations for heart failure incidents reported between the two groups [ Time Frame: 3 years ] Collection of all hospitalizations for heart failure between the two groups will use the log rank test for comparison of outcomes. Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards).

Pediatric hypertension specialists lack an evidentiary base on which to establish definitive clinical practice guidelines for first-line therapy. Significant practice variation is an unsurprising consequence. Routine choice of the same first-line therapy for most patients with hypertension, absent testing other options, may delay correction of blood pressure for months or years. Failure to incorporate patient preferences in medical decision-making may also contribute to decreased patient satisfaction and adherence. Large parallel-group, comparative effectiveness trials are likely not on the horizon for this population. Moreover, heterogeneity of treatment effects would minimize the generalizability of such a trial to all patients. This is a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial to test whether the n-of-1 trial approach is superior to usual care in normalizing blood pressure while minimizing exposure to compliance-reducing side effects.

Poor adherence remains a significant barrier to achieving full effectiveness and optimal long-term outcomes. This study aims to develop innovative group-based trajectory models to identify patients with similar ACE/ARB medication filling behavior among patients with co-morbid HTN and DM. The proportion of days covered (PDC), often used as an adherence measure, reduces complex patterns of longitudinal observations into a single value that cannot adequately depict different adherence experiences. Group based trajectory models are designed to identify patients with similar longitudinal patterns while capturing the dynamic nature. A motivational interviewing (MI) pharmacy student telephone intervention will then be customized by the identified trajectories and tested to demonstrate effectiveness in enhancing adherence. In pilot work, the investigator's team has demonstrated improvements in adherence through a pharmacy student telephone MI intervention. Pharmacy students have the knowledge base and training to provide comparable services to pharmacists at a lower cost. MI fosters behavior change by setting desired goals and promoting self-efficacy in a supportive, collaborative way. The objectives are to 1. Develop group-based trajectory models to identify patients with similar medication filling behavior patterns among patients enrolled in a Medicare advantage plan and 2. Customize an MI pharmacy student telephone intervention by the adherence patterns identified, and demonstrate the benefit of the customized intervention in improving adherence. Phase 1 of the project will be a retrospective analysis of 12 month refill data to determine patient adherence patterns. Phase 2 will be a prospective study among non-adherent patients to evaluate the effectiveness of the customized intervention (n=500). The students will contact patients assigned to the intervention group and follow a protocol using the Ask-Provide-Ask approach of MI given the patient adherence pattern for a tailored education. Monthly follow-up calls will be carried out for 6 months. Adherence during the 6 and 12 months post-intervention will be evaluated for the intervention and control groups as PDC as well as a categorical variable. Chi-square and t-tests will be used to evaluate the intervention effect. Multivariable multiple and logistic regression will be carried out in case of any significant differences in baseline characteristics. Implementing this project will provide students a unique MI training as a new way of communicating with patients. The training is further strengthened by PhD students trained in research design and statistical analyses to assist in the automated data analysis. The project will formulate a strong adherence research team at University of Houston that will be instrumental in implementing customized innovative interventions to improve medication adherence and subsequent health outcomes.

A few anti-hypertensive medications, including angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), may normalize dipping if administered at night. Chinese data are scarce and there are no prospective studies on cardiovascular outcomes in Chinese patients. Aim: To determine if the bedtime administration of ACEIs and ARBs is more effective at normalizing ND than morning administration. As a pilot project, the feasibility of recruiting hypertension patients in primary care for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and conducting a clinical trial will be evaluated such that future larger randomized trials can be planned to determine treatments for ND. Method: Fifty patients diagnosed with essential hypertension who are receiving either ACEIs or ARBs and diagnosed with ND will be randomized to take ACEIs or ARBs either early morning or before bedtime. A follow-up 48-hour ABPM will be performed after 4-6 weeks to examine post-treatment changes in BP and ND status. Outcome: The primary outcome of this proposed study is the proportion of ND at 6 weeks; secondary outcomes will include (i) mean awake and asleep SBP/DBP of 48-hour duration (ii) feasibility of this pilot study will be assessed by recruitment and dropout rates during the study period. Potential: This pilot study will provide the basis for a future larger randomized controlled study to further examine the treatment for ND in primary care.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03999502 First Posted : June 26, 2019 Last Update Posted : June 26, 2019 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Erasme University Hospital Study Description Go to  Brief Summary: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients. However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure. The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Approximately 250 million subjects worldwide and 30 million subjects in the US suffer from GERD. Among the 12 million Americans who suffer from daily heart-burn (the main symptom of GERD) almost 5 million do not respond completely to medications and many more do not want or cannot take medications due to side-effects (1). The goals of treatment in GERD are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis if present, prevent recurrence of symptoms and esophagitis, and prevent complications. Medical acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) heals esophagitis, relieves symptoms and improves quality of life. However, acid suppressive therapy does not correct the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter and hence symptoms of reflux due to weakly acidic or non-acid reflux persist in the majority of subjects who present with symptoms persisting on PPIs (regurgitations) (2). Abnormalities in the structure and function of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) such as a permanently open EGJ, a hiatal hernia, a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and transient LES relaxations (t-LESR) are the main pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to GERD (3). Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients (4,5). However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure (6,7). The results reported from operations performed in community hospital lower volume centers have been different than those achieved in centers of excellence. It has been reported that between 23% and 62% of patients who have undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication use acid suppression medications at long-term follow-up. Due to these issues patient and physician acceptance of surgical procedures remains low and is mainly limited to patients with severe GERD or those non-responsive to medications. For these reasons, less invasive endoscopic techniques to treat GERD have been developed during the last 2 decades, which may be categorized into 3 groups: (1) sewing/plication at the cardia and EGJ, (2) radiofrequency (RF) thermal therapy to the LES, and (3) injection/implantation of biopolymers at the EGJ. Minimally invasive endoluminal procedures for GERD are designed to provide long-lasting symptom relief and abolish or lessen medication dependency. Most endoluminal modalities that were introduced into clinical practice have failed due to lack of long-term efficacy, complications, or interruption of commercialization due to financial difficulties of the companies that developed the techniques (8,9). Endoscopic sewing/plication techniques comprised mucosal plications (Endocinch) that were not clinically useful because the plications were not durable, and full-thickness (serosa-to-serosa) plications allowing prolonged durability (NDO Plicator device and Esophyx device). The data from the RCTs with Plicator device were encouraging and the finding of better results with multiple plications without an increase in adverse events supported that this device could have clinical utility. However, the company ceased operations in 2008 and the device is no longer clinically available (10). Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) using Esophyx showed promising results in open studies (11). However, long-term follow-up revealed that a majority of patients required either ongoing PPI use or were referred for LNF owing to persistent symptoms (12). Endomina-v2 (Endo Tools Therapeutics SA, Rue Auguste Piccard 48, 6041 GOSSELIES, Belgium) is a CE marked device that can be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows manipulation of angulated tools during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibility to perform transoral surgical full thickness sutures and transoral endoscopic gastroplasty has shown to be safe and effective at mid-term follow-up in obese patients (13). The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use.

Other Name: Dexlansoprazole Experimental: Guided therapy group Participants will be give Dexlansoprazole 30 mg daily for GERD, 60 mg daily for GERD with erosive esophagitis for 8 weeks and Theophylline SR 250 mg daily for functional chest pain for 4 weeks. Drug: Guided therapy group Receive Dexlansoprazole 30 mg daily for GERD, 60 mg daily for GERD with erosive esophagitis for 8 weeks and Theophylline SR 250 mg daily for functional chest pain for 4 weeks. Other Name: Dexlansoprazole and/or Theophylline SR Detailed Description: Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is very common in the general population but symptom alone or patient's characteristics do not adequately differentiate cardiac and esophageal cause. Cardiologists are usually consulted first to exclude life-threatening acute coronary syndrome. Tests that are performed to exclude ischemic heart disease include exercise stress test and the more invasive coronary angiography. A negative stress test or angiogram or the presence of mild blockage of a single vessel disease will usually be adequate to exclude significant ischemia as a cause for chest pain. The next most important cause of unexplained chest pain would be gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD and its complications of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma have increased markedly in recent decades, not just in the developed countries but also in Asia. Although relatively less common among populations in Malaysia, there are data to suggest an increasing prevalence of reflux disease largely a result of obesity and increased intra-abdominal pressure. Dexlansoprazole (Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Japan) is a novel dual delayed release system recently approved by the FDA for treatment of heartburn associated with non-erosive and erosive reflux disease. It is unknown if dexlansoprazole is effective as an empirical therapy for NCCP. Another approach would be therapy guided by investigations including high resolution (HR) esophageal impedance manometry and 24-hour pH-impedance studies. Study of esophageal function has greatly evolved with the recent availability of high resolution multi-channel solid state manometer and impedance. Water swallows are commonly used in esophageal manometric studies to evaluate for peristaltic abnormalities. Esophageal pH monitoring does not detect all gastroesophageal reflux (GER) events but with the combination of impedance, this technique allows detection of GER of gas and acid or non-acid liquids. These tests would enable diagnosis of GERD and functional chest pain and thereby allow targeted therapy. For treatment of GERD, dexlansoprazole is effective and for functional chest pain, nonspecific adenosine antagonist, theophylline is proven to improve symptoms in patient with hypersensitive esophagus. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is also effective for functional chest pain , however it is not known if theophylline is more effective than any other SSRIs.It is unknown about the response rates based on the guided therapy approach compared to the empirical PPI therapy. Therefore, the aim of the intervention is to evaluate the effectiveness of empirical therapy vs. guided therapy on symptoms unexplained non-cardiac chest pain.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of GERD among college students in southwestern Saudi Arabia and to evaluate its personal, academic and stress correlates Materials and Methods: Through a cross-sectional study design, a self-reported questionnaire was distributed between a representative sample of students in health and non-health care colleges in southwestern Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included data for personal characteristics, academic study, and Arabic versions of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ) and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale. Condition or disease Other: no intervention Detailed Description: Study design and setting A cross-sectional study was carried out in both male and female campuses of King Khalid University (KKU) during the academic year 2018-2019. The University is located in Aseer region in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia. The area of Aseer region is about 80.000 square kilometers occupied with more than 1.6 million people. The university comprise 5 health colleges and 24 non-health colleges with a total number of 60.312 male and female students in the academic year 2014-2015. Target population Students in Health and non-health care colleges in KKU were the target population. Sample size and sampling method Sample size was estimated by using Epi info program version 7.2 with the anticipated prevalence of GERD symptoms among college students 23.8% [6], 95% confidence level and acceptable margin of error of 2.5%. The calculated cluster size was 1113 students. To account for the possibility of non-response, 1200 students were targeted from each of health and non-health care colleges. All health care colleges were included in the study. They were colleges of medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing and applied medical science. Five non- health care colleges were selected by random method. They were colleges of education, science, humanities, administrative and financial sciences, and languages and translation. Participants were selected through stratified cluster sampling technique. Within each college, students were stratified by academic level. Within each level a cluster (section or study group) was selected. When possible, all registered students within each cluster were included. Study tool and data collection A self-reported questionnaire was distributed personally by medical students-during their training in community medicine course- between the participants. The questionnaire includes the following sections: a) personal data such as, age sex, marital status, smoking status and family income; b) academic data which include, name of college, academic level and Grade point average (GPA); c) Arabic version of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ)[10]; d) Arabic version of Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [8]. All incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Arabic version of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ) GerdQ is a valid questionnaire used to explore the probaility of GERD. It is consisted of 6 questions as follow: four positive questions to assess GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, sleep disturbance related to heartburn and regurgitation and use of medications) and two negative questions (epigastric pain and nausea). Each item rated from 0 to 3 depending on the rate of symptoms over the previous week. GERD was detected with a total score value of 8 or more [10]. Score value of 8 or more plus total score value of 3 or more for the impact questions (sleep disturbance and use of medications) indicted GERD with impact on daily life. The Arabic version of GerdQ was developed and validated for use among Arabic speakers [11]. Data analysis The gained data were entered, revised, and analyzed using SPSS, version 22 software package. Grading of PSS into low, moderate and high was according to Cohen's et al [12]. Crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) were calculated using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis respectively. Their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to identify significant factors associated with GERD among students. Study Design Go to  Layout table for study information Study Type :

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03418337 First Posted : February 1, 2018 Last Update Posted : February 1, 2018 Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan Information provided by (Responsible Party): vghtpe user, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan Study Details Study Description Go to  Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Patients with atypical gastro-esophageal reﬂux disease (GERD), include cough, globus, and non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) usually require more aggressive or double dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy than patients with typical GERD. Dexlansoprazole is a new, dual delayed release formulation of PPI that increases the mean intragastric pH during a 24-hour period. The prospective, open-label, randomized study aims to compare the efficacy of two different PPI formula in treating patients with atypical GERD symptoms. Patients with atypical GERD symptoms and a total Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score ≥13 (cough, globus, and NCCP) will be invited to participate. Personal characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, and the severity of erosive esophagitis will be recorded. After enrollment, 120 subjects will randomly assign (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive either oral lansoprazole, Takepron OD 30 mg, once daily before breakfast or oral dexilansoprazole, Dexilant 60 mg, once daily before breakfast for 8 weeks. Subjects will record their symptoms (cough, globus, NCCP, heart burn, and acid regurgitation) at daytime and nighttime everyday via diary for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint is to compare the cumulated incidence of each symptom free during 8-week therapy period between the two study groups. The secondary endpoint will be the withdrawal or drop-out rate due to poor symptoms response or drug adverse effects. Data will be analyzed with SPSS Statistical Software for descriptive statistics (percentage, mean, standard error, and 95% confidence interval) and analytical statistics (chi-square test, ANOVA, and generalized estimation equation; GEE). Condition or disease Compare the Response Rate of Atypical GERD After PPI Therapy Drug: dexilansoprazole (Dexilant 60 mg) Drug: lansoprazole (Takepron OD 30 mg) Detailed Description: We conduct a prospective randomized study since July 2017 after IRB approval. Patients between the ages of 20 and 80 years presenting to the gastroenterology outpatient clinic for atypical GERD symptoms (cough, globus, and NCCP) with or without typical symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) of GERD will be invited to participate. After signing informed consents and screening, patients with atypical GERD symptoms for more than one month and with a total Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score ≥13 were eligible for enrollment.Patients who currently took pro-kinetic agents, baclofen, antacid, sucralfate, histamin-2 receptor antagonists, PPI, antitussive, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anxiolytics, or anti-depressants or takes aforementioned medication during study period, who have severe cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or renal disease, who have uncured underlying malignancy, will be excluded as are subjects with laryngeal or pharyngeal disorders, a history of gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, symptoms of GI tract obstruction, or a contraindication for PPI use. Personal characteristics including age, sex, habit of drinking and smoking, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and underlying co-morbidity including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia will be recorded. The findings of esophageal gastroduodenal scopy (EGD) will be recorded including the severity of erosive esophagitis (Los Angeles grade A-D or non-erosive reflux disease).The symptoms of atypical GERD including cough, globus sensation, and NCCP and the symptoms of typical GERD (heart burn and acid regurgitation) will be recorded everyday (daytime and night respectively) via diary before PPI therapy for 2 days and after PPI therapy for 8 weeks. The definitions of cough, globus sensation, NCCP, heart burn, and acid regurgitation will be according to a previous publication After enrollment, 120 subjects will randomly assign (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive either oral lansoprazole (Takepron OD 30 mg, Takeda Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) once daily before breakfast or oral dexilansoprazole (Dexilant 60 mg, Takeda Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) once daily before breakfast for 8 weeks. Subjects will record their symptoms (cough, globus, NCCP, heart burn, and acid regurgitation) at daytime and nighttime everyday for 8 weeks. Symptoms suspecting drug adverse effect including nausea, diarrhea, constipation, headache, dizziness, fatigue, flatulence, etc will be recorded for 8 weeks. Head elevation during sleeping, or on diet for body weight reduction, medication with pro-kinetic agents, baclofen, antacid, sucralfate, histamin-2 receptor antagonists, other PPI, antitussive, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anxiolytics, or anti-depressants will not be allowed during study period. Endpoints We will evaluate the response rate (symptom free) everyday during the 8-week PPI therapy for cough, globus sensation, NCCP, acid regurgitation, and heartburn respectively. The primary endpoint is to compare the cumulated incidence and the time of each symptom free during 8-week therapy period between the two study groups. The secondary endpoint will be the withdrawal or drop-out rate due to poor symptoms response or drug adverse effects. Study Design Go to

It is defined as a gastrointestinal motility disorder that results from the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus or oral cavity, causing symptoms or complications .The prevalence of GERD is estimated to be between 20 and 30% of adults in western countries. Some studies have found a correlation between GERD and certain diseases of the airway and a proposed association to others. Both asthma and laryngitis can be caused by GERD. Pepsin has been discovered in the middle ear of children with middle ear effusion and GERD has been implicated in the pathophysiology of otitis media with effusion. The authors conclude that there may be a role of antireflux therapy in patients with otitis media with effusion. The relationship between reflux and snoring/obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been studied, and it is known that OSAS patients have a high incidence of nocturnal gatroesophageal reflux (nGER). The coexistence of reflux and various respiratory disorders can be used to argue that there is probably a correlation between reflux and CRS. Though some data indicate an association between GERD and upper airway inflammatory disease, this remains a matter of controversy in today's medicine. It is suggested that, if an upper or lower respiratory tract disorder is causally related to GERD, certain criteria should be met: An increased coexistence of both disorders should exist compared to the general population. A biologically plausible pathophysological mechanism should explain how GERD can cause CRS. clinical manifestations of the suspected GERD-related CRS should respond to anti-reflux therapy. There are Some theories for the relation between gastric reflux and CRS. The first one is the direct exposure of the nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa to gastric acid causing inflammation of the mucosa and impaired mucociliary clearance which could cause obstruction of sinus ostia and recurrent infections. It is known that pH variations affect ciliary motility and morphology in the respiratory mucosa.The second hypothesis is a relationship mediated by the vagus nerve; a mechanism already proven in the lower airway and in the nasal mucosa of patients with rhinitis but not in patients with CRS. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system can lead to reflex sinonasal swelling and inflammation, and consequent blockage of the ostia. Demonstrated that by infusing saline with hydrochloric acid in the lower esophagus of healthy volunteers, there was increased production of nasal mucus, increased score of nasal symptoms, and reduced peak nasal inspiratory flow.

Drug: Alemtuzumab Alemtuzumab is administered to eligible patients in accordance with established treatment regimes. Initially 60 mg of alemtuzumab is injected intravenously over the course of 5 days. The first treatment series is followed by the injection of 36 mg of alemtuzumab over the course of 3 days 12 months later. During both drug interventions, the transient exacerbation in disease severity is alleviated by concomitant steroid therapy. Other Name: Lemtrada Detailed Description: Traditional paraclinical measures of disease severity in multiple sclerosis (MS), such as T2 lesion load as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are poorly correlated with long-term disability accumulation. Other surrogate markers of the current and future disease burden are therefore needed. The permeability of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) seems to better reflect the substantial, subclinical disease activity underlying MS progression. Its useful role as a prognostic marker in MS has been clearly established by the recent observation that BBB permeability increase in optic neuritis patients is associated with conversion to definite MS. BBB permeability can be quantified, in a convenient manner to the patient, using Dynamic-Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) by modelling the change in intrinsic MRI parameters of the human brain in response to the administration of a bolus contrast agent. Alemtuzumab is a disease modifying drug that depletes T- and B-cells. It is administered in two series separated by 12 months, as explained in the section ""Groups and Interventions."" The number of relapses are significantly reduced as compared to other efficacious treatments in MS, as demonstrated recently (study referred to by its ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00050778). The efficacy of alemtuzumab in resolving the inflammatory burden underlying relapses is, thus, well-established. Its influence on subclinical inflammation, however, remains unknown. It is the aim of the present study to investigate whether or not the latter influence is of importance, and, consequently, can be used to evaluate the need for an intensified treatment, in the form of an additional series of alemtuzumab administration. BBB permeability changes, as surrogate markers of subclinical inflammation, are measured every 6 months just prior to and during the course of alemtuzumab treatment. In order to elucidate other potential mechanisms involved in disability accumulation, biomarkers and MRI-derived parameters are evaluated concomitantly. Specifically, the role of metabolic changes are investigated using MRI methods that measures blood perfusion and oxygen consumption. Secondarily, the BBB permeability and metabolic changes are correlated to novel biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration in serum and urine, as well as conventional measures of MS severity: annual relapse rate, Expanded Disability Severity Score, MRI-derived estimates of disease activity and brain atrophy. 35 patients are included in the study in order to achieve enough statistical power and accommodate drop-outs. Patients are MRI scanned at baseline, 6 months after alemtuzumab treatment, and, finally, prior to administration of the second series of alemtuzumab 12 months after the baseline MRI scanning. At each time point, the patient's disease status is evaluated by an experienced neurologist, and urine and serum samples are obtained. Repeated Measures Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) will be used to evaluate changes of permeability of the BBB and metabolic parameters at different time points, and baseline characteristics, such as prednisolone treatment will be implemented as between-subjects covariates. Logistic regression will be applied to estimate the ability of BBB permeability changes to predict the need for additional series of alemtuzumab administration.   Eligibility 18 Years to 60 Years   (Adult) Sexes Eligible for Study:  "

There will be no requirement for blinding (patientor assessor) and data collected with the Reflex app will be compared against other data that track optic nerve functional status, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual fields (VF), low-contrast sensitivity, MRI orbits/brain and visual evoked potentials (VEP). Patients who have any diagnosis of ON, with or without a diagnosis of MS or NMOSD and who have had testing using other modalities such as VEPs, VF, low-contrast sensitivity studies, OCT, and MRI of brain or orbits will be included as retrospective subjects in the study. In this cohort, RAPD assessments will be completed and compared to against the data that has accrued as noted. Condition or disease Intervention/treatment Multiple Sclerosis Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Attack Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Relapse Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Progression Optic Neuritis Diagnostic Test: Reflex (Brightlamp Inc., Purdue University) Detailed Description: The purpose of this research is to gather information on whether using quantitative- or numerical measurements of pupil changes as an alternative to qualitative- or observation based- testing can be done to assess optic nerve dysfunction in ON, MS with ON, and NMOSD with ON. One way this is done is through evaluating relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), which is a clinical sign that is used to detect an injury or defect in the pupil's pathway and this often involves the retina of the eye, which focuses light, and the optic nerve, which sends visual information to your brain. When shining a light into each eye, the eye with RAPD shows a slowed response to light, and when the light moves to the normal eye, the pupil of RAPD eye will dilate. Observational evaluations of RAPD are very common in clinical neurology to detect these optic nerve diseases. As technology has advanced, to lessen the observation errors, numerical measurement of RAPD is now possible through a web based app called Reflex (Brightlamp Inc., Purdue University), which is a FDAapproved class I regulated medical device. In this study, we will compare the results of your app recording to other data that has been collected which also tracks optic nerve function status.

MS is an inflammatory demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Recently, MRI technics have demonstrated their sensibility to the different processes involved in MS. Particularly, MRI has evidenced that the pathological process of MS is not restricted to the macroscopic lesions of the white matter but also involves the normal appearing white and grey matter. In the normal appearing brain tissue, demyelination, neuronal suffering and neuronal loss have been evidenced. Moreover, MRI has demonstrated the existence of brain functional reorganization processes that may limit the clinical expression of pathological injuries. Despite these important findings, the pathological underpinnings of irreversible disability are largely unknown. The present project aims to depict the main determinants of physical but also cognitive disability in patients with MS. To do this, a longitudinal study including 70 patients with MS using different MRI markers known to be sensitive to the different pathological aspects of MS will be performed. The relationships between these markers and the progression of disability will be assessed. Identification of the main pathological underpinnings of irreversible disability of MS will provide the most relevant therapeutic targets.

Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a 'lumbar puncture' (a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine). Patients often report they find it painful and it can cause unintended complications requiring hospitalisations or time off work to recover. Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not always the case. Doctors do not find abnormalities in everyone who has MS but some people with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar puncture abnormalities. Both of these problems can lead to misdiagnosis. A new MRI scan allows doctors to see small veins that run through damaged areas of the brain in people with MS. It has been shown that this is a specific finding to MS, seldom seen in other conditions. It is not painful and carries few or no risks. This research aims to change the way people are diagnosed with MS and reduce the number of lumbar punctures used. The investigators will recruit a large number of people from different hospitals whose doctors suspect they may have MS. They will be invited to have the new eight-minute MRI scan. After 18 months, the investigators will find out what diagnosis is eventually reached and compare this to the finding of the new scan. The investigators will then compare the accuracy, speed, costs and acceptability of the different tests needed to make a diagnosis of MS and establish if most lumbar punctures can be replaced by a slightly longer MRI scan. This research could provide the National Health Service with a scientific approach to diagnose MS which is safer, more cost effective and importantly, more acceptable to patients. Condition or disease Intervention/treatment Multiple Sclerosis Diagnostic Test: T2* MRI Diagnostic Test: Lumbar puncture to test for presence of unmatched oligoclonal bands Detailed Description: The North American Imaging in MS Cooperative has reviewed the utility of the central vein sign (CVS) in the diagnosis of MS in 2015. They concluded that ""To formally establish the clinical value of the CVS for the differential diagnosis at disease onset, a large, prospective, multicentre study including patients at first presentation of possible MS is necessary"". The paper outlining the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS specifically mentions the promise of the CVS but suggests that it ""requires detailed investigation to determine whether it is useful and practical"". The rationale of this study is to provide an overwhelming case for a straightforward and rapid clinical adoption of our MRI test, which will change our ability to confirm or refute the diagnosis of MS. Radiologists and neurologists can also readily interpret our proposed CVS using a simple 'rule of six' that was described in a previous study. This involves the detection of any six lesions with a central vein present. This rule has the potential to be easily implemented in clinical practice if it has superior diagnostic sensitivity, when compared to lumbar puncture results. If the CVS can be shown to have superior diagnostic sensitivity at first presentation of MS, when compared to performing a lumbar puncture, then lumbar punctures can be avoided in many patients. These patients will benefit in several ways. The patients will avoid a procedure that is often painful or unpleasant. Those who currently refuse to have lumbar puncture will benefit from expedited diagnosis, limiting their anxiety and uncertainty. A secure diagnosis could lead to more rapid treatment decisions and a better long-term prognosis. In addition, fewer workdays will be lost attending hospital for investigation. From the NHS' perspective, it would avoid day case hospital admissions for lumbar punctures and readmissions to treat the common complication of post lumbar puncture headaches. This would create significant cost savings, when considering the significant number of patients undergoing this diagnostic process.

Not all patients with CIS get a relapse and develop multiple sclerosis but in those patients who do, irreversible damage of the central nervous system, e.g. axonal damage, is already detectable in that early stage of disease. Early initiation of immunomodulatory therapy is crucial for patients with clinically isolated syndrome who are at high risk for the development of multiple sclerosis. Vice versa identification of low risk patients could help to avoid an unnecessary therapy. In this prospective observational study we want to follow up patients with CIS and early multiple sclerosis over a period of four years and obtain clinical, laboratory and MRI - data in order to identify risk factors for relapses, prognostic factors and therapy response markers.

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently an invaluable diagnostic tool as structural lesions are accepted biomarkers. However, MRI lesions correlate poorly with disease burden underlining the clinical-radiological paradox. Therefore, more advanced MRI are needed to provide additional information beyond what is obtainable from conventional scans. Perfusion MRI alterations preceding overt BBB disruption and lesions have been described suggesting a microvascular pathology as an etiological contributor to MS lesions. Transient diffusion decrease observed by diffusion MRI support the hypothesis of a hypoxic event prior to BBB disruption. A new model of perfusion MRI (DSC) enables microvascular function assessment in MS. This model is yet to be tested on MS patients. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggest that virus receptor CD46 affects immunologic susceptibility to MS. CD46 is highly expressed on cerebral vascular endothelium and may protect BBB integrity. We hypotheses that CD46 activity is modulator of MS disease development, where CD46 modifications increases vulnerability to BBB disruption by attenuation of normal flow responses in MS brains. Aims: Besides testing correlations between microvascular dysfunction and MS clinical outcome, this have prompted us to investigate DSC-metric and predicted microvascular dysfunction in relation to defective CD46-driven immune responses. Method: For this we conducted our MRI study performed in a clinical research setting, and the - immunological study performed in a laboratory setting. Both studies are based on newly diagnosed MS patient assessments conducted at Department of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital. All subjects undergo clinical examination, blood/cerebrospinal fluid samples and a comprehensive 3Tesla (3T) MRI protocol. MRI parameters and immune responses are compared between study groups and related to clinical outcome. Study Design Go to  Layout table for study information Study Type :

The most severe clinical complication associated with LPLD is acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis in an LPLD subject often leads to prolonged hospital admissions. Subjects who survive repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis may develop chronic pancreatitis, ultimately resulting in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The clinical manifestations of acute pancreatitis episodes related to LPLD are largely indistinguishable from acute pancreatitis due to other causes. However, collection of data relating to hospital admissions, laboratory test results, scan images and adverse events occurring concomitantly to the acute pancreatic episode should allow elimination of other causes of pancreatitis (e.g. gallstones etc) and ultimately allow confirmation of LPLD-related acute pancreatitis. Characterisation of the presentation of symptoms which occur around the time of known episodes of LPLD-related acute pancreatitis should also permit identification of episodes of acute pancreatitis which have previously been considered as unrelated or even unrecognized. Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera®) is in development for the therapy of LPLD. In summary, alipogene tiparvovec contains the human lipoprotein (LPL) gene variant LPLS447X in a non-replicating vector in solution administered in a one-time series of intramuscular injections in the arms/legs. Studies conducted to date with Glybera have evaluated total triglyceride levels as a surrogate marker for efficacy and have not evaluated a clinical endpoint such as acute pancreatitis episodes as a primary endpoint. Post-hoc analysis has suggested that there may be a reduction in the frequency of acute abdominal pancreatitis episodes reported following treatment compared to the frequency reported pre-treatment from past medical history records. The recorded episodes used in this post-hoc analysis were collected from medical history and adverse event data but no uniform criteria were used to classify these as episodes of acute pancreatitis. Review of the post hoc analysis has raised questions that the recorded past medical history of pancreatitis episodes may be inaccurate with respect to diagnosis and number of episodes. In this case record review study, data will be collected on pancreatitis episodes from subjects who previously enrolled in studies PREPARATION-02 (observational), CT-AMT-011-01 and CT-AMT-011-02. In studies CT-AMT-011-01 and CT-AMT-011-02 subjects received AMT-011 at either dose 3 x 1011 gc/kg or 1 x 1012 gc/kg. Data obtained from medical records, hospital admission/discharge charts, laboratory results and imaging scans will be evaluated for evidence of LPLD-related episodes of pancreatitis by an expert review panel. The evaluation will consider data collected from three time periods: subjects entire past medical history, the period after enrolment into study but prior to AMT-011 therapy, the period post-administration of AMT-011. Data from the subjects who did not progress to receive AMT-011 will be evaluated as a control group using data collected from past medical history and from the period after enrolment in the PREPARATION-02.   Eligibility 18 Years to 70 Years Genders Eligible for Study:  "

Condition or disease Drug: Clinical treatment Detailed Description: Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by the sudden onset of abdominal pain, elevated serum amylase, and edema or necrosis of the pancreas. The clinical course of AP is generally mild; however, nearly 25% of patients progress into severe AP which consists of organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis. Although advances in the diagnosis and management have been made, AP remains a major health issue to the society. PNec is a major complication of AP which manifests as non-opacified parenchyma with intravenous contrast, as identified via contrast-enhanced CT scan. Patients with PNec are more likely to develop pancreatic infection and suffer a greater risk for mortality . Currently, CECT scans remain the ""gold standard"" to diagnosis PNec clinically. However, the extent of PNec is best seen about 3 days after the presentation of disease and may be missed in early CT scan. In addition, repeated CT scanning is not convenient to monitor changes in necrosis, most notably for those who are receiving mechanical ventilation or hemofiltration.The clinical diagnosis of AP is based on the presence of the following features: abdominal pain; serum amylase and/or lipase levels three times higher than the upper limit of normal; and characteristic findings of AP on CT scan. Specific plasma biomarkers in predicting pancreatic necrosis (PNec) are needed in treating acute pancreatitis (AP). Aims To investigate the prognostic value of plasma mitochondrial DNA fragments (mtDNA) in patient with AP for PNec. Methods AP patients with symptoms onset within 72 h were prospectively enrolled.The conclusions elevated plasma mtDNA content in AP patients may be used as a more accurate early predictor of PNec in contrast to traditional CRP. Normally,human mtDNA is strictly contained in mitochondria and not exposed to the innate immune system even following cell apoptosis. However, in times of cell death elicited by stress (e.g., trauma and sepsis), mtDNA is released into systemic circulation and leads to an array of inflammatory reactions. Elevated mtDNA levels have been reported in a variety of clinical situations, including trauma, severe sepsis, and cancer. As PNec is caused by intracellular activation of digestive enzymes and autodigestion, we assumed that circulating mtDNA levels could be used as a biomarker for early detection of PNec.

Patients admitted in the Emergency Department with the clinical suspicion of acute pancreatitis will be processed through the history, physical examination and laboratory findings. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is established by the presence of 2 of the 3 following criteria: typical abdominal pain, serum amylase and / or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients will be informed about the study protocol and the possible risks and adverse events, after which they will be asked to accept participation in the study. Acceptance of participation will be confirmed by signed informed consent. After acceptance patients will be randomized by computer-generated sequences of random numbers in the two groups Group one (1) will receive a bolus of fluid 20 ml / kg of Ringer's solution for infusion within one hour of the diagnosis and the group two (2) will receive a bolus of fluid 40 ml / kg of Ringer's solution for infusion within one hour of the diagnosis. All patients who have the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, but did not agree to participate in research or have some other exclusion criteria will be treated according to the standards of good clinical practice and the recommendations of the current clinical guidelines for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria beside refusal to sign informed consent are: age less than 18 years, pregnancy, patients with physical signs of heart failure, previously known congestive heart failure (NYHA III - IV) and severe kidney disease more than one month before the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (defined as severe reduction in eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Patients who develop acute renal failure as a result of acute pancreatitis will be involved in research . Given the importance of early hydration in patients with acute pancreatitis and the lack of clearly defined dose of administered fluid in the current literature, aim of this study was to determine the influence of the size of the dose bolus of intravascular fluid after the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in the further course and outcome of disease. The study will be conducted in the Emergency Department, Clinical Hospital Centre, Rijeka.   Eligibility

As numerous trials have failed to show a benefit to specific pharmacologic therapies in acute pancreatitis, the mainstay of treatment has been both supportive care and early, aggressive fluid resuscitation. Small randomized studies have shown conflicting results with regards to the influence of resuscitation fluid on outcomes in acute pancreatitis, necessitating a large randomized trial to clarify if fluid choice matters or not in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. The objective of this study is to assess the comparative efficacy of normal saline versus lactated ringer's solution in the management of acute pancreatitis. Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Hospital with acute pancreatitis will be randomized to fluid resuscitation with NS or LR with volumes of fluid administered according to a pre-determined algorithm that will be the same for both treatment arms. The primary outcome of the study will be the change in SIRS prevalence from enrollment to 24 hours. Secondary outcomes will include the change in SIRS prevalence from enrollment to 48 hours and 72 hours, development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis, change in PASS score, ICU admission, length of hospitalization, persistent pain or disability after discharge, and time of advancement to oral diet and discharge. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Background: Acute pancreatitis is a common problem in the United States necessitating 275,000 hospital admissions per year, with resultant healthcare costs of approximately 2.5 billion USD annually. As numerous trials have failed to show a benefit to specific pharmacologic therapies in acute pancreatitis, the mainstay of treatment has been both supportive care and early, aggressive fluid resuscitation. Small randomized studies have shown conflicting results with regards to the influence of resuscitation fluid on outcomes in acute pancreatitis, necessitating a large randomized trial to clarify if fluid choice matters or not in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Objective: To assess the comparative efficacy of normal saline versus lactated ringer's solution in the management of acute pancreatitis. Study Design: Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Hospital with acute pancreatitis are the focus population of this study. Patients will be randomized to fluid resuscitation with NS or LR within 8 hours of diagnosis of pancreatitis. The inclusion and exclusion criterion will be assessed (see below). Randomization will be performed using a random sequence algorithm with concealed allocation. The patients will be blinded to allocation by covering the bag with an opaque covering. A study physician determining the outcomes will also be blinded. Following randomization, the volumes of fluid administered for the resuscitation will be determined by a pre-determined algorithm that will be the same for both treatment arms. The hydration algorithm is as follows: all patients will receive a bolus of the treatment fluid at a rate of 5 mL/kg/hour to be administered over the first two hours (total 10 mL/kg) with an assessment for volume overload at 1 hour. They will then will receive maintenance fluids at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour. After 12 hours participants will have blood urea nitrogen (BUN) assessed, which is part of the standard clinical procedure. Those who do not have a fall in this parameter or who develop SIRS by this 12 hour checkpoint will receive a second 5 mL/kg/hour bolus over two hours (as above) of their designated treatment fluid followed by further treatment fluid at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour. Those who do have a fall in BUN will receive further treatment fluid at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour for 12 additional hours. Patients' volume status will be assessed in the following manner: study physicians will perform a targeted physical exam which will include assessment of JVD, lung auscultation, and monitoring for edema Q12 hours for the first 24 hours, then daily for the remainder of the hospital admission. In elderly patients and those with co-morbidities, the targeted physical exam will be performed Q12 hours for the entire hospital admission. Vitals will also be obtained Q6-8 hours. If they develop signs of fluid overload including pitting edema, ascites, anasacra, pulmonary edema, or dyspnea, or signs of renal failure including oliguria, anuria, or hypotension, they will have their fluid rate managed at the discretion of their treating physicians. However, it will be requested that if further fluid is given that it be the assigned type (LR versus NS). At 24 hours patients will be assessed for SIRS development (see outcomes). Beyond this point fluid rate will be per the primary team though it still be encouraged that the assigned type of fluid (LR versus NS) is used for additional resuscitation with the rate and volume beyond this point at the discretion of the treating physician. However, if the treating physicians have a strong preference to change to a different fluid type for clinical reasons this will be recorded (for post hoc analysis) and the patient included in the intention to treat analysis.

Other: Analysis of gastric juice Analysis of gastric juice including routine, biochemical and microbiological analysis. Other Name: Routine,biochemical, microbiological analysis Detailed Description: Functional dyspepsia (FD) and acid/bile reflux disease are common. These diseases share similar clinical manifestations. Individuals with functional dyspepsia (FD) often present upper abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, early satiety, loss of appetite, and no organic factors underlie it. Individuals suffering from acid/bile reflux disease often complain heartburn, upper abdominal burning or discomfort. What is more, there are always no specific changes on traditional endoscopy that can be used to differentiate these diseases (except erosive esophagitis). Though proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test is frequently applied to confirm the diagnosis of acid reflux disease, but certain amounts of individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not show favorable response to PPI test. In order to make a distinction of these diseases, esophageal pH-metry is needed, however it is not always available in most clinics. Recent data showed that new endoscopic technology such as Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging could demonstrate indistinct lesions caused by GERD which are not detectable by standard endoscopy, subsequently improve endoscopic diagnosis of these diseases. In addition, simultaneous analysis of gastric juice can help to determine whether bile reflux is present or not. As it is known, pathologic refluxes underlie not functional dyspepsia but acid/bile reflux disease. Hence, it is hypothesized that Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging in combination with simultaneous analysis of gastric juice could be used to differentiate functional dyspepsia from acid/bile reflux disease.   Eligibility 18 Years to 75 Years Genders Eligible for Study:

Dexlansoprazole is a new, dual delayed release formulation of PPI that increases the mean intragastric pH during a 24-hour period. The prospective, open-label, randomized study aims to compare the efficacy of two different PPI formula in treating patients with atypical GERD symptoms. Patients with atypical GERD symptoms and a total Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score ≥13 (cough, globus, and NCCP) will be invited to participate. Personal characteristics including age, sex, body mass index, and the severity of erosive esophagitis will be recorded. After enrollment, 120 subjects will randomly assign (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive either oral lansoprazole, Takepron OD 30 mg, once daily before breakfast or oral dexilansoprazole, Dexilant 60 mg, once daily before breakfast for 8 weeks. Subjects will record their symptoms (cough, globus, NCCP, heart burn, and acid regurgitation) at daytime and nighttime everyday via diary for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint is to compare the cumulated incidence of each symptom free during 8-week therapy period between the two study groups. The secondary endpoint will be the withdrawal or drop-out rate due to poor symptoms response or drug adverse effects. Data will be analyzed with SPSS Statistical Software for descriptive statistics (percentage, mean, standard error, and 95% confidence interval) and analytical statistics (chi-square test, ANOVA, and generalized estimation equation; GEE). Condition or disease Compare the Response Rate of Atypical GERD After PPI Therapy Drug: dexilansoprazole (Dexilant 60 mg) Drug: lansoprazole (Takepron OD 30 mg) Detailed Description: We conduct a prospective randomized study since July 2017 after IRB approval. Patients between the ages of 20 and 80 years presenting to the gastroenterology outpatient clinic for atypical GERD symptoms (cough, globus, and NCCP) with or without typical symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) of GERD will be invited to participate. After signing informed consents and screening, patients with atypical GERD symptoms for more than one month and with a total Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) score ≥13 were eligible for enrollment.Patients who currently took pro-kinetic agents, baclofen, antacid, sucralfate, histamin-2 receptor antagonists, PPI, antitussive, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anxiolytics, or anti-depressants or takes aforementioned medication during study period, who have severe cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, or renal disease, who have uncured underlying malignancy, will be excluded as are subjects with laryngeal or pharyngeal disorders, a history of gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, symptoms of GI tract obstruction, or a contraindication for PPI use. Personal characteristics including age, sex, habit of drinking and smoking, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and underlying co-morbidity including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia will be recorded. The findings of esophageal gastroduodenal scopy (EGD) will be recorded including the severity of erosive esophagitis (Los Angeles grade A-D or non-erosive reflux disease).The symptoms of atypical GERD including cough, globus sensation, and NCCP and the symptoms of typical GERD (heart burn and acid regurgitation) will be recorded everyday (daytime and night respectively) via diary before PPI therapy for 2 days and after PPI therapy for 8 weeks. The definitions of cough, globus sensation, NCCP, heart burn, and acid regurgitation will be according to a previous publication After enrollment, 120 subjects will randomly assign (at a 1:1 ratio) to receive either oral lansoprazole (Takepron OD 30 mg, Takeda Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) once daily before breakfast or oral dexilansoprazole (Dexilant 60 mg, Takeda Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) once daily before breakfast for 8 weeks. Subjects will record their symptoms (cough, globus, NCCP, heart burn, and acid regurgitation) at daytime and nighttime everyday for 8 weeks. Symptoms suspecting drug adverse effect including nausea, diarrhea, constipation, headache, dizziness, fatigue, flatulence, etc will be recorded for 8 weeks. Head elevation during sleeping, or on diet for body weight reduction, medication with pro-kinetic agents, baclofen, antacid, sucralfate, histamin-2 receptor antagonists, other PPI, antitussive, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anxiolytics, or anti-depressants will not be allowed during study period. Endpoints We will evaluate the response rate (symptom free) everyday during the 8-week PPI therapy for cough, globus sensation, NCCP, acid regurgitation, and heartburn respectively. The primary endpoint is to compare the cumulated incidence and the time of each symptom free during 8-week therapy period between the two study groups. The secondary endpoint will be the withdrawal or drop-out rate due to poor symptoms response or drug adverse effects. Study Design Go to

Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter predominantly found in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin is associated with psychological disorders, including anxiety and depression, and emotion regulation and it has been shown that anxiety and depression are associated with increased severity of GERD-related symptoms. Citalopram and other SSRI's elevate the concentration of serotonin by blocking the reabsorption into the presynaptic neuron and thereby increasing the level of serotonin available to bind the postsynaptic receptor. A recent study showed beneficial effects of citalopram in patients with reflux hypersensitivity. However, there was no objective measurement for reflux nor esophageal sensitivity during the treatment period. Moreover, the effect of citalopram in patients with functional heartburn has not been studied so far. Therefore, we will conduct a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram on the improvement in symptom severity, reflux parameters and esophageal sensitivity. 50 patients with reflux hypersensitivity and 50 patients with functional heartburn will receive either placebo or citalopram (Cipramil®) 20 mg as an add-on for a period of 8 weeks. Symptom severity will be assessed by a validated reflux questionnaire (ReQuest questionnaire and diaries), reflux parameters by performing a 24 hour impedance-pH monitoring and esophageal sensitivity using our multimodal esophageal stimulation paradigm Condition or disease Study Design Go to  Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator) Primary Purpose: Treatment Official Title: A Placebo-controlled Trial With Citalopram for the Treatment of Typical Reflux Symptoms in Patients With Reflux Hypersensitivity or Functional Heartburn With Incomplete Proton Pump Inhibitor Response Estimated Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Citalopram is taken once a day as an add-on to PPI treatment (2x/d).

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03999502 First Posted : June 26, 2019 Last Update Posted : June 26, 2019 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Erasme University Hospital Study Description Go to  Brief Summary: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients. However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure. The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a common problem affecting 10-20% of the population in the Western World. Approximately 250 million subjects worldwide and 30 million subjects in the US suffer from GERD. Among the 12 million Americans who suffer from daily heart-burn (the main symptom of GERD) almost 5 million do not respond completely to medications and many more do not want or cannot take medications due to side-effects (1). The goals of treatment in GERD are to relieve symptoms, heal esophagitis if present, prevent recurrence of symptoms and esophagitis, and prevent complications. Medical acid-suppressive therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) heals esophagitis, relieves symptoms and improves quality of life. However, acid suppressive therapy does not correct the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter and hence symptoms of reflux due to weakly acidic or non-acid reflux persist in the majority of subjects who present with symptoms persisting on PPIs (regurgitations) (2). Abnormalities in the structure and function of the esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) such as a permanently open EGJ, a hiatal hernia, a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and transient LES relaxations (t-LESR) are the main pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to GERD (3). Surgical therapy is able to restore the EGJ barrier function against reflux of the gastric content, decreases symptoms and improves the quality of life in GERD patients (4,5). However, there remain concerns regarding postoperative adverse events and the durability of the surgical procedure (6,7). The results reported from operations performed in community hospital lower volume centers have been different than those achieved in centers of excellence. It has been reported that between 23% and 62% of patients who have undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication use acid suppression medications at long-term follow-up. Due to these issues patient and physician acceptance of surgical procedures remains low and is mainly limited to patients with severe GERD or those non-responsive to medications. For these reasons, less invasive endoscopic techniques to treat GERD have been developed during the last 2 decades, which may be categorized into 3 groups: (1) sewing/plication at the cardia and EGJ, (2) radiofrequency (RF) thermal therapy to the LES, and (3) injection/implantation of biopolymers at the EGJ. Minimally invasive endoluminal procedures for GERD are designed to provide long-lasting symptom relief and abolish or lessen medication dependency. Most endoluminal modalities that were introduced into clinical practice have failed due to lack of long-term efficacy, complications, or interruption of commercialization due to financial difficulties of the companies that developed the techniques (8,9). Endoscopic sewing/plication techniques comprised mucosal plications (Endocinch) that were not clinically useful because the plications were not durable, and full-thickness (serosa-to-serosa) plications allowing prolonged durability (NDO Plicator device and Esophyx device). The data from the RCTs with Plicator device were encouraging and the finding of better results with multiple plications without an increase in adverse events supported that this device could have clinical utility. However, the company ceased operations in 2008 and the device is no longer clinically available (10). Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) using Esophyx showed promising results in open studies (11). However, long-term follow-up revealed that a majority of patients required either ongoing PPI use or were referred for LNF owing to persistent symptoms (12). Endomina-v2 (Endo Tools Therapeutics SA, Rue Auguste Piccard 48, 6041 GOSSELIES, Belgium) is a CE marked device that can be attached to an endoscope inside the body and allows manipulation of angulated tools during a peroral intervention. It offers the possibility to perform transoral surgical full thickness sutures and transoral endoscopic gastroplasty has shown to be safe and effective at mid-term follow-up in obese patients (13). The ability to perform endoscopic full-thickness plications with Endomina-v2 will be used to assess safety and feasibility of the procedure in reducing GERD in patients suffering with chronic GERD, unsatisfied with PPIs, and/or complaining of persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI use.

Ambulatory 24-h pH-impedance monitoring consists of recording the occurrence of reflux episodes by introducing a transnasal catheter into the esophagus. After inserting the transnasal HRIM probe and the pH-impedance catheter, both HRIM and 24-h pH-impedance recordings are started. The patient is instructed to eat a meal that induces reflux symptoms (the patient brings his own meal). One hour the end of the meal, the HRIM probe is removed. The patient is discharged at home and the 24-h pH-impedance monitoring is continued. The patient is coming back 24-h after catheter insertion to stop the pH-impedance recording and remove the catheter.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03722303 First Posted : October 26, 2018 Last Update Posted : October 26, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Melvin Rosenwasser, Columbia University Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: This study applies the regenerative properties of autologous fat transfer to treat mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in comparison to the current standard of care, corticosteroid treatment. The investigators hypothesize the fat transfer would prevent scar formation and aid in nerve excursion along the canal (while the neoangiogenic and regenerative growth factors could stimulate nerve regeneration) better than the standard of care treatment. Condition or disease Other: Fat Injection Drug: Steroid Injection Early Phase 1 Detailed Description: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy affecting up to 13% of Americans; CTS is caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel leading to nerve ischemia and symptoms of numbness, pain, and tingling. Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms and range from noninvasive options (most commonly, steroid injections) to definitive surgical release of the compressed median nerve. Both non-invasive techniques and surgical intervention have their shortcomings; thus a novel approach for CTS treatment may be indicated. Lipografting is an established, validated, and widely used technique of plastic surgeons that injects autologous fat to correct contour deformities. From observing these reconstructions, plastic surgeons have witnessed the regenerative properties of fat transfer, specifically delaying the affects of chronic radio-dermatitis. These clinical manifestations have fostered numerous studies defining fat as a rich source of pluripotent stem cells with the potential for reducing scar formation, bringing neo-angiogenesis, and providing a barrier against scar adhesions This study applies the regenerative properties of autologous fat transfer to treat mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome in comparison to the current standard of care, corticosteroid treatment. Ideally, the fat transfer would prevent scar formation and aid in nerve excursion along the canal, while the neoangiogenic and regenerative growth factors could stimulate nerve regeneration. Study Design Go to  Lipografting Versus Steroid Injections for Treatment of Primary Mild to Moderate Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Actual Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Subjects with CTS will receive steroid injection.

Other Name: Fat Transfer Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Functional Outcome Score [ Time Frame: Up to 1 year post-treatment ] This score will be determined by Quick-Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH), which is a validated tool/survey for measuring upper extremity disability. The QuickDASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom section (11 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance sport/music or work modules (4 items, scored 1-5). These raw scores are used to calculate a score out of 100, with a higher score indicating greater disability. Secondary Outcome Measures : Score on the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ) [ Time Frame: Up to 1 year post-treatment ] The MHQ is hand-specific outcomes instrument that measures outcomes of patients with conditions of, or injury to, the hand or wrist. In the pain scale, high scores indicate greater pain, while in the other five scales, high scores denote better hand performance. Score on the Brigham Women's Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire [ Time Frame: Up to 1 year post-treatment ] Brigham Women's Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire is a validated tool for measuring severity of symptoms for carpal tunnel syndrome. The questionnaire is self-administered, with each item scored from 1 to 5 (where 1 indicates no symptoms or no functional difficulty, and 5 indicates maximum symptoms or an inability to perform the functional task).

People in the case group with the symptom ""numbness"" and then were clinical and neural-electrophysiological diagnosed CTS. People in the control group would be exclude the symptom ""numbness"". The case group included clinical diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome which was divided into 4 parts every 10 years old age. The gender of the patients of the control group was matched to the case group and divided into 4 parts by age. Other: the disease Observation the patients and non-patients Control Group The present case-control study was based on the single medical center in Shanghai, China, in which more than 5000 CTS patients per year are treated. The hospital involved in the study is a university teaching hospital. Cases were recruited from the surgical wards and appropriate outpatient clinics, while the controls were recruited from the outpatient clinics. Both groups filled out a standardized questionnaire, and a standardized patient record was filled out by a hand surgeon. In addition, participants with jobs involving lifting and carrying of loads were interviewed. Other: the disease Observation the patients and non-patients Detailed Description: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), or median neuropathy at the wrist, is a medical condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to paresthesia, numbness and muscle weakness in the hand. It's the most common neuro-compressive disease. With the development of the modern life, the morbidity of CTS is also raised(J. D. Bland and S. M. Rudolfer, 2003). As a common disease, the study on etiology is very important in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which can improve the life quality of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The risk factors include individual factors such as age(I. Atroshi et al., 1999), gender(P. A. Nathan et al., 2005), diabetes(J. Becker et al., 2002), Hypothyroidism(Y. Karpitskaya et al., 2002a)，obesity(C. Boz et al., 2004), complication of systematic diseases(J. M. Geoghegan et al., 2004; P. Hartmann et al., 2012; H. Mbarki et al., 2013)， tobacco(Y. Karpitskaya et al., 2002a)，injury(J. M. Geoghegan et al., 2004)，etc. and occupational factors.(J. H. Andersen et al., 2003; A. E. Barr et al., 2004; D. Coggon et al., 2013) As most of the research were based on the population in western country and the life style and the ethnicity between Chinese people and western country people is quite different, there may be some similarities and differences in epidemiology. There is seldom similar research in China so that this study was conducted to observe the characteristics of these risk factors in Chinese population.   Eligibility 41 Years to 70 Years   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:  "

Following the recruitment stage, participants will be asked to attend Medway Maritime Hospital once a week for four weeks, to receive the massage protocol. At the first session participants shall be asked to rate their pain (NPRS), before receiving a massage treatment. This will be followed by instructions on how to perform self-massage, which they will be asked to complete daily over the four-week period, and record in a diary. At the remaining three sessions, participants shall just complete the NPRS prior to receiving the massage treatment. After four weeks the group will be reassessed at the same Orthopaedic Clinic they attended prior to recruitment. They will be asked to complete a final pain score, record any changes in their condition, repeat the initial symptom questionnaire, and finally preform a grip strength test. The duration of four weeks was chosen as this is the time-frame within which the specific massage protocol advises a 'significant symptom improvement' should be seen.

Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Given the large societal costs of carpal tunnel surgery and existence of a relatively inexpensive treatment option, carpal tunnel release provides fertile ground for testing whether societal costs can influence patient decision-making in hand surgery. Such work would inform future efforts to reduce societal healthcare costs by elucidating whether appeals to societal cost are effective at driving stewardship of limited healthcare resources at the patient level. In this study, the investigators aimed to answer this question by presenting participants with a hypothetical scenario in which the participants had to choose between surgery and wrist bracing for carpal tunnel syndrome. Participants were randomized into two cohorts and societal cost information was presented to the intervention group. The effect of societal cost information on treatment choice is assessed, along with participants' healthcare attitudes.

It has been estimated that 36 million people have dementia worldwide, and in older people Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-70% of all dementia. Research supports the hypothesis that modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with cognitive decline, which opens new avenues for prevention or modification of disease. The concept that inspires this proposal 'Ageing-Gut-Brain Interactions study' is that the gut microbiota impact upon the gut-brain axis and thereby on behaviour, including challenging behaviours often associated with dementia. In the absence of available cures for Alzheimer's disease, diet is an important modifiable component but knowledge about the role of diet in clinical symptoms of dementia is currently very limited. A recent study from Ireland from the European Union funded Nu-Age cohort reported that the gut microbiota profile in the elderly was different between community-living and institutionalized individuals, with specific microbiome profiles correlating with frailty and poor health. Changes in dietary composition and diversity were considered the main drivers of the shifts in gut bacteria profile. In this multi-disciplinary research study, the investigators will assess the gut microbiota composition in people with Alzheimer's dementia with and without challenging behaviours, test the feasibility of recruitment, and provide initial data to support a future grant application involving a dietary intervention study in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The investigators will test the hypothesis that the gut-brain axis promotes behavioural changes in Alzheimer's dementia and is responsive to changes in gut microbiota profile, by comparing the gut microbiota profile between three participant groups (1) Alzheimer's dementia with challenging behaviour, (2) Alzheimer's dementia without challenging behaviour, and (3) a control group of healthy age-matched elderly. The investigators will also carry out a survey of care homes to assess their willingness to participate in a future dietary supplementation study. Condition or disease Detailed Description: Introduction Healthy life expectancy is a key area of research. It has been estimated that 36 million people have dementia worldwide and that there are 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year. Epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis that modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with cognitive decline, opening new avenues for prevention. Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia in older people, accounting for 60-70% of all dementia cases when using traditional diagnostic criteria for dementia subtypes. There are no available cures for AD, but an alternative approach is to use strategies that delay disease progression at an early stage. Optimal brain function results from highly complex interactions between numerous genetic and environmental factors, including food intake, physical activity, age and stress. Diet in particular has become the object of intense research in relation to cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiota is a large, diverse collection of microbes, collectively containing 100 times more genes than the host. It is host-specific, contains heritable components, can be modified by diet, surgery or antibiotics, and in its absence nearly all aspects of host physiology are affected. We now realise that the human microbiota is a previously overlooked system that makes a significant contribution to human biology and development.There is a new and exciting field of research with limited published data in the elderly, that could provide a basis for the design of novel, microbiota-targeted, therapies to improve care of older people who suffer from Alzheimer's dementia. There is increasing evidence that identifies the gut microbiota as a key conduit between nutrition and brain function. Reduction in the frequency of genes encoding short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was prominent among institutionalized older adults, as were increases in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins-6 and -8, and C-reactive protein. Rationale for Study Hypothesis: The composition and/or diversity of the gut microbiota is different between healthy elderly and those with Alzheimer's dementia, who do or do not exhibit behaviour(s) that are challenging. The concept that inspires Ageing-GB is that our gut microbiota impact upon the gut-brain axis and thereby on behaviour. There is a need to understand the nature of that impact, the underlying mechanisms, and how changes in diet can reprogram our gut microbiota-brain axis to resolve or reduce clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer's dementia. However, to the investigator's knowledge, there has been no published work to examine the gut microbiota profile in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, the investigators first need to demonstrate the differences in microbiota profile between AD patients with or without behaviours that are more challenging to manage. This work is anticipated to provide fundamental evidence to support dietary modification or supplementation as cost-effective and safe avenues for alleviating signs and symptoms of dementia in this vulnerable group and thus reduce the carer burden. This study will require the co-operation of care home managers and staff, and investigators will thus simultaneously assess the feasibility of performing a nutritional intervention study in this group of individuals, in this setting.

In Korea, the prevalence of dementia among elderly people aged 65 and over was 9.18% in 2012, and the number of patients with dementia was estimated to be 540,755 (155,955 for male, 384,800 for female). The number of patients with dementia will be doubled every 20 years until 2050, which is estimated to be 840,000 in 2020, about 1.27 million in 2030, and 2.71 million in 2050. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 55-70% of all dementia. Major risk factors include age, genetic factors, apolipoprotein E gene, female and brain trauma, but stress is also associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Stress can be present anywhere in our daily lives, and stress can energize life, but if people are exposed to stress for a long time, they may develop physical symptoms. Severe and long-term stress can cause or exacerbate diseases such as angina, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, tension headache, back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma and arthritis. Studies about the relationship between stress and Alzheimer's disease have shown that the corticotrophin releasing factor secreted when exposed to stress can increase brain toxic protein such as beta amyloid plaques that are known to be responsible for dementia. There are various ways to overcome stress, like meditation, yoga and relaxation training methods that individuals can do at home. Relaxation training methods include relaxation using breathing and progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation therapy stabilizes anxious psychology by stretching and relaxing several muscles of the body in turn. Muscle relaxation promotes arterial and venous flow, lymphatic flow, reduces edema of muscles and connective tissues, and improves organ function to aid homeostasis. Muscle relaxation has been reported to be effective in alleviating anxiety and agitation symptoms in patients with dementia, but no studies have examined the effects of muscle relaxation therapy on cognitive function changes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare and validate the improvement of cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment over the age of 50 years and patients with early Alzheimer's dementia after performing muscle relaxation machine massage regularly.

At the end of life, over 230,000 persons with dementia annually are cared for in hospice, yet hospice agencies are ill prepared to care for this population and often resort to inappropriate pharmacologic measures such as antipsychotics that reduce quality of life rather than improve it. This study will therefore through its two phases refine and then implement, using a pragmatic stepped wedge trial design, the Dementia Symptom Management at Home Program Hospice Edition, with the goal improving quality of care for the person with dementia and their caregiver, reducing antipsychotic use, and increasing bereaved caregiver satisfaction in the hospice setting.

The original study design included co-primary endpoints of cognition and function—measured by ADAS-Cog14 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale) and ADCS-iADL (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), respectively. Emerging scientific evidence supports the idea that cognitive decline precedes and predicts functional decline in Alzheimer's disease, particularly in earlier stages of the disease.1,2,3 Thus, Lilly has decided to amend the EXPEDITION3 trial to include a single primary endpoint of cognition (ADAS-Cog14). Functional outcomes will be measured during the trial in the same manner as previously designed, using both the ADCS-iADL and the FAQ (Functional Assessment Questionnaire). These two functional outcomes will now be considered key secondary endpoints for the EXPEDITION3 study. It is important to note that the endpoint change affects the study's data analysis plan, but it does not affect anything related to the actual conduct of the trial. Lilly will continue to remain blinded to study data until after the database lock occurs in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lilly understands that regulators globally will continue to view both cognitive and functional endpoints as necessary for clinical trials in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia, and regulatory guidance has been to include these as co-primary endpoints. Lilly is submitting the EXPEDITION3 amendment to all appropriate regulatory authorities. About Solanezumab Solanezumab is Lilly's Phase 3 monoclonal antibody being studied as a potential therapy for people with mild Alzheimer's dementia, prodromal Alzheimer's dementia and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Solanezumab binds to soluble monomeric forms of amyloid beta after it is produced, allowing it to be cleared from the brain before it clumps together to form amyloid plaques. About EXPEDITION3 EXPEDITION3 is a Phase 3 trial of solanezumab. Participant enrollment completed in 2015 and last patient visit is expected in October 2016. Top-line results will be reported after completion of database lock and analysis. EXPEDITION3 is the first Phase 3 trial to evaluate only people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. About Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease is a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition. It is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases.4 There are currently an estimated 47 million people living with dementia worldwide.5 The number of people affected by dementia is expected to be nearly 75 million in 2030 and nearly 132 million in 2050.4 Estimates vary, but experts suggest that as many as 5.3 million Americans may have Alzheimer's disease.4 About Eli Lilly and Company Lilly is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world. We were founded more than a century ago by a man committed to creating high-quality medicines that meet real needs, and today we remain true to that mission in all our work. Across the globe, Lilly employees work to discover and bring life-changing medicines to those who need them, improve the understanding and management of disease, and give back to communities through philanthropy and volunteerism.

There are two components to this practice intervention: 1. Provider Training, and 2. Proxy Education. Behavioral: TRAIN-AD The study intervention is a multi-component training and education program targeting direct care providers and healthcare proxies for advanced dementia NH residents, intended to improve the management of urinary and lower respiratory tract infections in advanced dementia patients. There are two components to this practice intervention: 1. Provider Training, and 2. Proxy Education. Intervention components aimed at the provider include: Professionally led infection management training seminars, online infection management course, and infection management guidance algorithms. Additionally participating prescribing providers will be sent bimonthly infection management feedback reports. Proxy Education is completed by providing an infection management in Advanced Dementia booklet to proxies of patients with AD upon resident enrollment in study. No Intervention: CONTROL Facility randomized to the control arm will employ usual care for the management for suspected infections in advanced dementia, Detailed Description: The final stage of dementia is characterized by recurrent suspected infections. Research has shown these episodes are widely mismanaged, leading to adverse patient and public health outcomes. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed in advanced dementia, most often in the absence of clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main risk factor for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia are three times more likely to be colonized with MDROs compared to other residents. Moreover, as these patients are in the terminal phase of dementia, evidence suggests they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials. Comfort is the stated goal of care for 90% of advanced dementia patients, and the risks and burdens associated with work-up and treatment of suspected infections generally do not promote that goal, particularly when hospitalization is involved. Taken together, there is a clear need to improve infection management in advanced dementia both to provide better end-of-life care to these patients and reduce the public health threat of MDROs. This is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve infection management for suspected UTIs and LRIs among residents with advanced dementia (N=480; N=240/arm) living in NHs (N=24; N=12/arm). The NH is the unit of randomization as the intervention must be delivered at the facility level to avoid contamination and because this is how it would be employed in the real-world. Analyses will be at the patient level.   Eligibility 21 Years and older   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03586778 First Posted : July 16, 2018 Last Update Posted : July 16, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Eric Gattie, Concord Hospital Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: The aim of this trial will be to examine the short and long term effectiveness of dry needling on pain, disability, and patient perceived improvements in patients with back pain attending physical therapy. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive dry needling, manual therapy, and exercise will achieve greater reductions in pain and disability in the short (6 weeks) and long term (6 and 24 months) compared to those who receive just manual therapy, and exercise. Condition or disease Other: dry needling Other: manual therapy Other: therapeutic exercise Not Applicable Detailed Description: Background: Back pain is a very common and costly disorder. The financial burden is one of the highest of all health issues. Current treatments are not adequately effective for a large proportion of patients who continue to experience recurrent pain and ongoing disability. Therefore, new treatment strategies should be investigated in an attempt to reduce the disability and high costs associated with back pain. Dry needling is a technique in which a fine needle is used to penetrate the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and muscle with the intent to mechanically disrupt tissue without the use of an anesthetic. Dry needling is emerging as a treatment modality that is widely used clinically to address a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Recent studies of dry needling have shown decreased pain, increased pain pressure threshold, improved range of motion, and decreased disability in the short term. The majority of these studies examined dry needling using methods atypical to clinical practice (dry needling as a sole treatment, or fewer visits than is common practice). No studies have included long-term follow up. A clinical trial with realistic treatment time frames and methods consistent with clinical practice is needed to examine the effectiveness of dry needling on reducing pain and enhancing function in patients presenting with back pain. Both short and long term treatment outcomes need to be collected as there is emerging evidence that dry needling may be more effective in maintaining treatment effects in the long term. Therefore, the aim of this trial will be to examine the short and long term effectiveness of dry needling on pain, disability, and patient perceived improvements in patients with low back pain. Purpose: The aim of this trial will be to examine the short and long term effectiveness of dry needling on pain, disability, and patient perceived improvements in patients with back pain. Design: The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines. All patients with back pain referred to physical therapy will be screened for eligibility criteria. Participants will be randomized to receive 1) dry needling, manual therapy, and exercise or 2) manual therapy and exercise. Participants will receive 8 treatments over a maximum of 6 weeks. Methods: The primary outcome will be disability as measured by the Modified Oswestry Disability Index. Pain and patient perceived improvement will also be recorded. STarT Back clinical measurement tool will be used to monitor patient's risk dto develop chronic back pain. Outcome measures will be assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 24-months by an assessor who is blind to the group allocation of the participants to determine the short and long-term treatment effects. Data Analysis: The investigators will examine the primary aim with 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment group (MTEX vs. MTEX-DN) as the between subjects independent variables and time (baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months, 24 months) as the within-subjects independent variable. The hypothesis of interest is the 2-way group * time interaction. Significance: The successful completion of this trial will provide evidence to demonstrate whether dry needling is effective for the management of back pain when used in a combined treatment approach as is commonly practiced clinically.

Outcome Measures Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Primary Outcome Measures : Change from baseline of Modified Oswestry Disability Index(MODI) [ Time Frame: baseline, six weeks, six months and 24 months ] Modified Oswestry Disability Index (MODI) is one of the modified versions of the Oswestry Disability Index. It consists of 10 items addressing different aspects of function. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing greater disability. The total score is multiplied by 2 and expressed as a percentage. Secondary Outcome Measures : Change from baseline of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) [ Time Frame: baseline, six weeks, six months and 24 months ] Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a single item measure of pain using a 100 mm horizontal line anchored on the left side of which represents ""no pain"" and the right side represents ""the worst pain imaginable"". Patients mark a score by making a vertical line, where they feel it best represents their pain intensity. Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire ( FABQ) [ Time Frame: baseline, six weeks, six months and 24 months ] Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire ( FABQ) focused specifically on patients' beliefs about how physical activity and work affects their low back pain. Global Rating of Change (GROC) [ Time Frame: six weeks, six months and 24 months ] Global Rating of Change (GROC) is a 15-point scale used to quantify a patient's improvement with treatment or to record the clinical course of a condition over time. Patients are asked to describe their overall condition since the start of treatment until the present time with options ranging from -7 (""a very great deal worse"") to +7 (""a very great deal better"") and 0 being described as ""about the same."" STarT Back [ Time Frame: baseline, six weeks, six months and 24 months ] STarT Back is a clinical measurement tool is a questionnaire used to help to categorize patients into three subgroups based on their risk for developing chronic lower back pain. The STarT Back clinical measurement tool consists of 9 items including leg pain, common pain, disability (2 items), bothersomeness, catastrophization, fear, anxiety, and depression. Each question is answered on either a 5 point Likert scale or a 10 point Likert scale.

However, only a small minority (<1%) will have a medical condition (such as Cauda Equina Syndrome) which requires immediate medical intervention. Currently, it is not known how many people access Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in an attempt to meet their needs for their back pain. The demand on EMS is increasing and many of these patients could be better managed by other services. Additionally, little is known about the characteristics of those accessing EMS due to back pain, or the nature of the contacts regarding issues such as outcome of the patient contact. The aims of this study are: to quantify the prevalence of people contacting EMS via telephone with non-traumatic back pain to describe the characteristics of people calling EMS with non-traumatic back pain to describe key characteristics of the contact between the service user and EMS to compare the call prevalence, patient characteristics and contact characteristics between people with non-traumatic back pain and a group of people for whom EMS contact is recommended as standard, in this case people presenting with cerebrovascular accident (CVA). A secondary aim of the work is to explore what factors might predict patient outcomes such as whether the patient is transported to A/E, whether the patient receives analgesics, and whether the patient is admitted to hospital.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03393429 First Posted : January 8, 2018 Last Update Posted : January 8, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Prof. Dr. Gerold Ebenbichler, Medical University of Vienna Study Details Study Description Go to  Brief Summary: Work place related (lower) back pain in medical personnel is limiting to workability. Even though occupational prevention programs are increasingly established, data on the effectiveness of training interventions offered at work-sites is largely missing. In this randomized, investigator-blind, controlled feasibility study we aim to compare the effectiveness of device assisted training therapy in comparison to a general recommendation ""to stay active"" or group gymnastics in terms of pain frequency and intensity (main outcome). Additional outcome variables are: quality of life, psychological well-being, work efficiency, of sick-leave days. Eligible employees (2 x 30) of the General Hospital of Vienna (AKH) over the age of 45 years suffering from (lower) back pain (>30 days/last year) of intensity ≥ 3 (numeric scale 0-10) will be included in two parallel groups. Group I starts with a device (DAVID) assisted training (40 training sessions; 2x / week) of the core trunk musculature. Group II gets instructions and an advice on how to ""stay active"" during the first 6 months. Assessment will be conducted before and after these 6 months; then groups are switched, thus, study subjects act as their own controls. Condition or disease Back Pain Lower Back Pain Other: DAVID assisted training Other: training recommendation Detailed Description: Work place related pain syndromes of the (lower) back pose a major health problem for medical personnel. Beside the discomfort and limitations of the affected patients, a severe restriction of their ability to work must be considered. For secondary prevention of back pain, health promotion programs are recommended. These consist of psychosocial and ergonomic interventions and, above all, a regular strengthening of the stabilizing muscle groups. Specific strength and endurance training for the trunk musculature with appropriate equipment is considered as a useful preventive measure and thus commonly offered at large corporations, even during working hours of the staff. However, data clearly demonstrating the effectivity and cost-effectiveness of these interventions is largely missing. This pilot study serves several purposes: On one hand, the feasibility of a randomized, controlled study is to be examined, which is to prove the effectiveness of the medical training therapy in comparison to a general recommendation ""to stay active"" or in comparison to group gymnastics. In particular, logistical problems in the organization of training therapy and training compliance must be clarified. On the other hand, this pilot study serves to generate hypotheses. Several variables in regard to possible changes due to the training intervention will be investigated. Collected pilot data will be used for corresponding case number estimates of a subsequent confirmatory study. The outcome variables are: number of back pain days and intensity, quality of life, psychological well-being, work efficiency, days of sick-leave. Study Design Randomized, investigator-blind, controlled pilot study with parallel group comparison of outcomes in employees of the General Hospital of Vienna (AKH) over the age of 45 years Study Subjects 2 x 30 employees over the age of 45, who suffered more than 30 days of back and / or lower back pain of moderate to high intensity ≥ 3 (numeric scale 0-10) in the last year and suffer from pain in up to 3 body parts (in total) or less. Group I starts with a machine assisted training, group II starts after a period of observation half a year later. Study Interventions 40 training sessions (2x / week) with DAVID training machines, which aim to improve the strength, endurance and performance of the core trunk musculature. The training will be initiated after a sufficiently long period of adjustment to the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine. The training plan is created individually for each subject. 4 to 6 people per hour can work out simultaneously. The training should be completed in max 6 months or less. Group II gets instructions and an advice on how to ""stay active"" during the first 6 months. Assessment will be conducted before and after these 6 months. After 6 months the groups are switched (group I with the initial DAVID machine assisted training is left with recommendations to ""stay active""; subjects from group II are now trained for 6 months by means of 40 training sessions (2x / week) with DAVID assistance), thus, study subjects act as their own controls.

Recruiting######Inclusion Criteria: Participants aged 21 to 70 with CBP will be enrolled. CBP will be defined according to the criteria established by a recent NIH task force (Deyo et al., 2014). Pain duration must be at least 3 months, with back pain being an ongoing problem for at least half the days of the last 6 months. That is, patients can meet criteria by either reporting pain every day for the past 3 months, or by reporting pain on half or more of the days for the past 6+ months. This will be determined by asking patients: (1) How long has back pain has been an ongoing problem for you? (2) How often has low back pain been an ongoing problem for you over the past 6 months? A response of greater than 3 months to question 1 and a response of ''at least half the days in the past 6 months'' to question 2 would define CBP. Patients must rate pain intensity at 40/100 or greater on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), in keeping with inclusion criteria from previous CBP trials (Baliki et al., 2012; Cherkin et al., 2016; Hashmi et al., 2013; Seminowicz et al., 2011). Back pain must be elicited by our back pain device (see below). Participants must also be comfortable and able to communicate via email or text message, as several study measures are collected in this manner (see below). Exclusion Criteria: Back pain associated with compensation or litigation issues as determined by self-report within the past year. Leg pain is greater than back pain. This suggests neuropathic pain, which may be less responsive to placebo or psychotherapy. Difficulty participating for technical/logistical issues (e.g., unable to get to assessment sessions). Self-reported diagnoses of schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder, or dissociative identity disorder. Self-reported use of intravenous drugs, due to concerns about infections and subject compliance with experimental protocols. Inability to undergo MRI as determined by MRI safety screen (e.g., pregnancy, metal in body, claustrophobia, using the standard screen conducted by the MRI imaging facility). Hypersensitive or hyposensitive to pressure pain: unable to tolerate 7kg/cm2 stimulation or reporting no pain for 4kg/cm2 stimulation; see further details below. Current regular use of an immunosuppressant drug, such as steroids. Such drugs interfere with immunoassay results. Self-reported history of metastasizing cancers—cancer of the breast, thyroid, lung, kidney, prostate or blood cancers. Self-reported history of stroke, brain surgery, or brain tumor. Self-reported diagnosis of a specific inflammatory disorder: rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, scleroderma, Lupus, or polymyositis. Unexplained, unintended weight loss of 20 lbs. or more in the past year. Cauda Equina syndrome, as screened for by self-reported inability to control bowel or bladder function.   Contacts and Locations Information from the National Library of Medicine To learn more about this study, you or your doctor may contact the study research staff using the contact information provided by the sponsor.

The most severe clinical complication associated with LPLD is acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis in an LPLD subject often leads to prolonged hospital admissions. Subjects who survive repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis may develop chronic pancreatitis, ultimately resulting in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The clinical manifestations of acute pancreatitis episodes related to LPLD are largely indistinguishable from acute pancreatitis due to other causes. However, collection of data relating to hospital admissions, laboratory test results, scan images and adverse events occurring concomitantly to the acute pancreatic episode should allow elimination of other causes of pancreatitis (e.g. gallstones etc) and ultimately allow confirmation of LPLD-related acute pancreatitis. Characterisation of the presentation of symptoms which occur around the time of known episodes of LPLD-related acute pancreatitis should also permit identification of episodes of acute pancreatitis which have previously been considered as unrelated or even unrecognized. Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera®) is in development for the therapy of LPLD. In summary, alipogene tiparvovec contains the human lipoprotein (LPL) gene variant LPLS447X in a non-replicating vector in solution administered in a one-time series of intramuscular injections in the arms/legs. Studies conducted to date with Glybera have evaluated total triglyceride levels as a surrogate marker for efficacy and have not evaluated a clinical endpoint such as acute pancreatitis episodes as a primary endpoint. Post-hoc analysis has suggested that there may be a reduction in the frequency of acute abdominal pancreatitis episodes reported following treatment compared to the frequency reported pre-treatment from past medical history records. The recorded episodes used in this post-hoc analysis were collected from medical history and adverse event data but no uniform criteria were used to classify these as episodes of acute pancreatitis. Review of the post hoc analysis has raised questions that the recorded past medical history of pancreatitis episodes may be inaccurate with respect to diagnosis and number of episodes. In this case record review study, data will be collected on pancreatitis episodes from subjects who previously enrolled in studies PREPARATION-02 (observational), CT-AMT-011-01 and CT-AMT-011-02. In studies CT-AMT-011-01 and CT-AMT-011-02 subjects received AMT-011 at either dose 3 x 1011 gc/kg or 1 x 1012 gc/kg. Data obtained from medical records, hospital admission/discharge charts, laboratory results and imaging scans will be evaluated for evidence of LPLD-related episodes of pancreatitis by an expert review panel. The evaluation will consider data collected from three time periods: subjects entire past medical history, the period after enrolment into study but prior to AMT-011 therapy, the period post-administration of AMT-011. Data from the subjects who did not progress to receive AMT-011 will be evaluated as a control group using data collected from past medical history and from the period after enrolment in the PREPARATION-02.   Eligibility 18 Years to 70 Years Genders Eligible for Study:  "

As numerous trials have failed to show a benefit to specific pharmacologic therapies in acute pancreatitis, the mainstay of treatment has been both supportive care and early, aggressive fluid resuscitation. Small randomized studies have shown conflicting results with regards to the influence of resuscitation fluid on outcomes in acute pancreatitis, necessitating a large randomized trial to clarify if fluid choice matters or not in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. The objective of this study is to assess the comparative efficacy of normal saline versus lactated ringer's solution in the management of acute pancreatitis. Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Hospital with acute pancreatitis will be randomized to fluid resuscitation with NS or LR with volumes of fluid administered according to a pre-determined algorithm that will be the same for both treatment arms. The primary outcome of the study will be the change in SIRS prevalence from enrollment to 24 hours. Secondary outcomes will include the change in SIRS prevalence from enrollment to 48 hours and 72 hours, development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis, change in PASS score, ICU admission, length of hospitalization, persistent pain or disability after discharge, and time of advancement to oral diet and discharge. Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Background: Acute pancreatitis is a common problem in the United States necessitating 275,000 hospital admissions per year, with resultant healthcare costs of approximately 2.5 billion USD annually. As numerous trials have failed to show a benefit to specific pharmacologic therapies in acute pancreatitis, the mainstay of treatment has been both supportive care and early, aggressive fluid resuscitation. Small randomized studies have shown conflicting results with regards to the influence of resuscitation fluid on outcomes in acute pancreatitis, necessitating a large randomized trial to clarify if fluid choice matters or not in the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Objective: To assess the comparative efficacy of normal saline versus lactated ringer's solution in the management of acute pancreatitis. Study Design: Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Hospital with acute pancreatitis are the focus population of this study. Patients will be randomized to fluid resuscitation with NS or LR within 8 hours of diagnosis of pancreatitis. The inclusion and exclusion criterion will be assessed (see below). Randomization will be performed using a random sequence algorithm with concealed allocation. The patients will be blinded to allocation by covering the bag with an opaque covering. A study physician determining the outcomes will also be blinded. Following randomization, the volumes of fluid administered for the resuscitation will be determined by a pre-determined algorithm that will be the same for both treatment arms. The hydration algorithm is as follows: all patients will receive a bolus of the treatment fluid at a rate of 5 mL/kg/hour to be administered over the first two hours (total 10 mL/kg) with an assessment for volume overload at 1 hour. They will then will receive maintenance fluids at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour. After 12 hours participants will have blood urea nitrogen (BUN) assessed, which is part of the standard clinical procedure. Those who do not have a fall in this parameter or who develop SIRS by this 12 hour checkpoint will receive a second 5 mL/kg/hour bolus over two hours (as above) of their designated treatment fluid followed by further treatment fluid at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour. Those who do have a fall in BUN will receive further treatment fluid at a rate of 3 mL/kg/hour for 12 additional hours. Patients' volume status will be assessed in the following manner: study physicians will perform a targeted physical exam which will include assessment of JVD, lung auscultation, and monitoring for edema Q12 hours for the first 24 hours, then daily for the remainder of the hospital admission. In elderly patients and those with co-morbidities, the targeted physical exam will be performed Q12 hours for the entire hospital admission. Vitals will also be obtained Q6-8 hours. If they develop signs of fluid overload including pitting edema, ascites, anasacra, pulmonary edema, or dyspnea, or signs of renal failure including oliguria, anuria, or hypotension, they will have their fluid rate managed at the discretion of their treating physicians. However, it will be requested that if further fluid is given that it be the assigned type (LR versus NS). At 24 hours patients will be assessed for SIRS development (see outcomes). Beyond this point fluid rate will be per the primary team though it still be encouraged that the assigned type of fluid (LR versus NS) is used for additional resuscitation with the rate and volume beyond this point at the discretion of the treating physician. However, if the treating physicians have a strong preference to change to a different fluid type for clinical reasons this will be recorded (for post hoc analysis) and the patient included in the intention to treat analysis.

Although the majority of patients have a mild disease course, around 20% will develop moderate or severe pancreatitis, with necrosis of the (peri) pancreatic tissue and/or multiple-organ failure. Previous studies have correlated colonic involvement as a prognostic marker in acute pancreatitis. It is well known that translocation of the colonic flora may significantly influence the clinical course of patients with acute pancreatitis. The correlation between collection(s) around colon in CT finding and clinical outcomes has not been studied in necrotizing pancreatitis. In current study, the investigators will do a prospective observational study correlating collection(s) around the colon and clinical course of patients in acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Condition or disease Detailed Description: Introduction and rationale of the study: Acute pancreatitis is the leading gastrointestinal cause of hospitalization in the US, with 270,000 admissions annually. Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process which causes a local and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although the majority of patients have a mild disease course, around 20% will develop moderate or severe pancreatitis, with necrosis of the (peri) pancreatic tissue and/or multiple-organ failure About 5-10% of patients develop necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma, the peripancreatic tissue or both. A collection containing variable amounts of both fluid and necrosis associated with necrotizing pancreatitis; the necrosis can involve the pancreatic parenchyma and/or the peri- pancreatic tissues. A mature, encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peri- pancreatic necrosis with well defined inflammatory wall is walled off necrosis (WON). It usually occurs >4 weeks after onset of necrotizing pancreatitis. Colonic involvement may predict disease severity and outcome. Clinical features may appear late in the course. Colonic complications occur in 1% patients with acute pancreatitis with 6-40% occurring with necrotizing pancreatitis. Correlation between colonic wall thickening at CT and the clinical course has already been established in non-necrotizing pancreatitis. Colonic necrosis is an adverse prognostic factor in pancreatic necrosis. Extension of necrosis towards the transverse colon and the splenic flexure were seen most commonly observed. Previous studies have correlated colonic involvement as a prognostic marker in acute pancreatitis. It is well known that translocation of the colonic flora may significantly influence the clinical course of patients with acute pancreatitis. The correlation between collection(s) around colon in CT finding and clinical outcomes has not been studied in necrotizing pancreatitis. Work plan methodology: This will be a prospective, observational study, to be conducted in 20 bed ICU of department of Critical Care Medicine, Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Postgraduate and Medical Sciences, Lucknow. All adult (≥18 years) ICU patients who had acute necrotizing pancreatitis will be considered. Demographic and clinical characteristics of all ICU patients who fulfill inclusion criteria will be collected along with relevant laboratory tests done for patient management routinely. ICU prognostication scores, i.e., Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score will also be recorded. The investigators will review all available computed tomography scans (CT Scans) of abdomen, from 2nd week to 6th week of pancreatitis, which will be done as per treating clinicians during patient ICU stay. Collection around colon is classified as: 1. No pericolonic collection; 2. Less than 90 degree encasement of colon; 3. In between 90-180 degree; 4. More than 180 degree encasement of colon. Other intra-abdominal collection will also be noted along with mesocolon. Clinical course will be followed till ICU discharge in terms of need for drain and surgery, intra-abdominal infection, and survival at discharge. Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis will be done and data will be presented as mean or median. Intervention: None. Waiver of consent has been granted by the Institute Ethics Committee (IEC).

Patients admitted in the Emergency Department with the clinical suspicion of acute pancreatitis will be processed through the history, physical examination and laboratory findings. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is established by the presence of 2 of the 3 following criteria: typical abdominal pain, serum amylase and / or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients will be informed about the study protocol and the possible risks and adverse events, after which they will be asked to accept participation in the study. Acceptance of participation will be confirmed by signed informed consent. After acceptance patients will be randomized by computer-generated sequences of random numbers in the two groups Group one (1) will receive a bolus of fluid 20 ml / kg of Ringer's solution for infusion within one hour of the diagnosis and the group two (2) will receive a bolus of fluid 40 ml / kg of Ringer's solution for infusion within one hour of the diagnosis. All patients who have the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, but did not agree to participate in research or have some other exclusion criteria will be treated according to the standards of good clinical practice and the recommendations of the current clinical guidelines for the treatment of acute pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria beside refusal to sign informed consent are: age less than 18 years, pregnancy, patients with physical signs of heart failure, previously known congestive heart failure (NYHA III - IV) and severe kidney disease more than one month before the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (defined as severe reduction in eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Patients who develop acute renal failure as a result of acute pancreatitis will be involved in research . Given the importance of early hydration in patients with acute pancreatitis and the lack of clearly defined dose of administered fluid in the current literature, aim of this study was to determine the influence of the size of the dose bolus of intravascular fluid after the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in the further course and outcome of disease. The study will be conducted in the Emergency Department, Clinical Hospital Centre, Rijeka.   Eligibility

In the evaluation of acute biliary pancreatitis, many scoring systems have been established (Atlanta, Ranson, APACHE, BISAP etc.) from past to present to determine morbidity and mortality of the disease. In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the correlation between morbidity and mortality of acute biliary pancreatitis and serum proinflammatory cytokines with ELISA and lymphocyte subtypes with Flow-cytometry. Condition or disease Other: Blood lymphocyte subtypes and serum cytokines Detailed Description: Pancreatitis is a common complication especially in patients with gallbladder stones, most patients with biliary pancreatitis may recover spontaneously without sequelae, but in 10-20% of patients, the disease is severe and mortality rates of up to 30% are detected in these patients. In patients with severe pancreatitis, aggressive fluid replacement, organ damage follow-up, appropriate antibiotherapy, and endoscopic sphincterotomy and radiological interventions may be of great benefit. In the evaluation of acute biliary pancreatitis, many scoring systems have been established (Atlanta, Ranson, APACHE, BISAP etc.) from past to present to determine morbidity and mortality of the disease. There are limited number of studies in the literature about the immune parameters in the evaluation of acute pancreatitis. In a studies, serum inflammatory markers such as IL-1, IL-6 and CD4, CD8 T lymphocyte and Treg population were evaluated. It was reported that inflammatory markers, especially anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels were elevated in patients with acute pancreatitis, and CRP and IL-1β levels of inflammatory markers were higher in patients with organ failure. Treg cells are reported to be an independent prognostic factor in determining the severity of acute pancreatitis. There is only one study with a limited number of patients in whom PD-1 values in T lymphocytes and PD-L1 values in monocytes were determined in the literature. In this study, it is stated that PD-L1 can be used as a new marker in determining infectious complications. In patients diagnosed with acute biliary pancreatitis, determination of the course of the disease at the time of diagnosis is extremely important for treatment and survival. In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the correlation between morbidity and mortality of acute biliary pancreatitis and serum proinflammatory cytokines with ELISA and lymphocyte subtypes with Flow-cytometry.

The original study design included co-primary endpoints of cognition and function—measured by ADAS-Cog14 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale) and ADCS-iADL (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), respectively. Emerging scientific evidence supports the idea that cognitive decline precedes and predicts functional decline in Alzheimer's disease, particularly in earlier stages of the disease.1,2,3 Thus, Lilly has decided to amend the EXPEDITION3 trial to include a single primary endpoint of cognition (ADAS-Cog14). Functional outcomes will be measured during the trial in the same manner as previously designed, using both the ADCS-iADL and the FAQ (Functional Assessment Questionnaire). These two functional outcomes will now be considered key secondary endpoints for the EXPEDITION3 study. It is important to note that the endpoint change affects the study's data analysis plan, but it does not affect anything related to the actual conduct of the trial. Lilly will continue to remain blinded to study data until after the database lock occurs in the fourth quarter of 2016. Lilly understands that regulators globally will continue to view both cognitive and functional endpoints as necessary for clinical trials in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia, and regulatory guidance has been to include these as co-primary endpoints. Lilly is submitting the EXPEDITION3 amendment to all appropriate regulatory authorities. About Solanezumab Solanezumab is Lilly's Phase 3 monoclonal antibody being studied as a potential therapy for people with mild Alzheimer's dementia, prodromal Alzheimer's dementia and preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Solanezumab binds to soluble monomeric forms of amyloid beta after it is produced, allowing it to be cleared from the brain before it clumps together to form amyloid plaques. About EXPEDITION3 EXPEDITION3 is a Phase 3 trial of solanezumab. Participant enrollment completed in 2015 and last patient visit is expected in October 2016. Top-line results will be reported after completion of database lock and analysis. EXPEDITION3 is the first Phase 3 trial to evaluate only people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. About Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's disease is a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition. It is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases.4 There are currently an estimated 47 million people living with dementia worldwide.5 The number of people affected by dementia is expected to be nearly 75 million in 2030 and nearly 132 million in 2050.4 Estimates vary, but experts suggest that as many as 5.3 million Americans may have Alzheimer's disease.4 About Eli Lilly and Company Lilly is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world. We were founded more than a century ago by a man committed to creating high-quality medicines that meet real needs, and today we remain true to that mission in all our work. Across the globe, Lilly employees work to discover and bring life-changing medicines to those who need them, improve the understanding and management of disease, and give back to communities through philanthropy and volunteerism.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03593941 First Posted : July 20, 2018 Last Update Posted : July 20, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): University of Aberdeen Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Groups and Cohorts Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: This research project will address a desperate need for evidence on how diet could be used to treat and improve symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been estimated that 36 million people have dementia worldwide, and in older people Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-70% of all dementia. Research supports the hypothesis that modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with cognitive decline, which opens new avenues for prevention or modification of disease. The concept that inspires this proposal 'Ageing-Gut-Brain Interactions study' is that the gut microbiota impact upon the gut-brain axis and thereby on behaviour, including challenging behaviours often associated with dementia. In the absence of available cures for Alzheimer's disease, diet is an important modifiable component but knowledge about the role of diet in clinical symptoms of dementia is currently very limited. A recent study from Ireland from the European Union funded Nu-Age cohort reported that the gut microbiota profile in the elderly was different between community-living and institutionalized individuals, with specific microbiome profiles correlating with frailty and poor health. Changes in dietary composition and diversity were considered the main drivers of the shifts in gut bacteria profile. In this multi-disciplinary research study, the investigators will assess the gut microbiota composition in people with Alzheimer's dementia with and without challenging behaviours, test the feasibility of recruitment, and provide initial data to support a future grant application involving a dietary intervention study in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The investigators will test the hypothesis that the gut-brain axis promotes behavioural changes in Alzheimer's dementia and is responsive to changes in gut microbiota profile, by comparing the gut microbiota profile between three participant groups (1) Alzheimer's dementia with challenging behaviour, (2) Alzheimer's dementia without challenging behaviour, and (3) a control group of healthy age-matched elderly. The investigators will also carry out a survey of care homes to assess their willingness to participate in a future dietary supplementation study. Condition or disease Detailed Description: Introduction Healthy life expectancy is a key area of research. It has been estimated that 36 million people have dementia worldwide and that there are 4.6 million new cases of dementia every year. Epidemiological evidence supports the hypothesis that modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with cognitive decline, opening new avenues for prevention. Alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause of dementia in older people, accounting for 60-70% of all dementia cases when using traditional diagnostic criteria for dementia subtypes. There are no available cures for AD, but an alternative approach is to use strategies that delay disease progression at an early stage. Optimal brain function results from highly complex interactions between numerous genetic and environmental factors, including food intake, physical activity, age and stress. Diet in particular has become the object of intense research in relation to cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiota is a large, diverse collection of microbes, collectively containing 100 times more genes than the host. It is host-specific, contains heritable components, can be modified by diet, surgery or antibiotics, and in its absence nearly all aspects of host physiology are affected. We now realise that the human microbiota is a previously overlooked system that makes a significant contribution to human biology and development.There is a new and exciting field of research with limited published data in the elderly, that could provide a basis for the design of novel, microbiota-targeted, therapies to improve care of older people who suffer from Alzheimer's dementia. There is increasing evidence that identifies the gut microbiota as a key conduit between nutrition and brain function. Reduction in the frequency of genes encoding short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was prominent among institutionalized older adults, as were increases in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins-6 and -8, and C-reactive protein. Rationale for Study Hypothesis: The composition and/or diversity of the gut microbiota is different between healthy elderly and those with Alzheimer's dementia, who do or do not exhibit behaviour(s) that are challenging. The concept that inspires Ageing-GB is that our gut microbiota impact upon the gut-brain axis and thereby on behaviour. There is a need to understand the nature of that impact, the underlying mechanisms, and how changes in diet can reprogram our gut microbiota-brain axis to resolve or reduce clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer's dementia. However, to the investigator's knowledge, there has been no published work to examine the gut microbiota profile in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, the investigators first need to demonstrate the differences in microbiota profile between AD patients with or without behaviours that are more challenging to manage. This work is anticipated to provide fundamental evidence to support dietary modification or supplementation as cost-effective and safe avenues for alleviating signs and symptoms of dementia in this vulnerable group and thus reduce the carer burden. This study will require the co-operation of care home managers and staff, and investigators will thus simultaneously assess the feasibility of performing a nutritional intervention study in this group of individuals, in this setting.

The AMARANTH independent data monitoring committee recommended the study continue without modification after a scheduled interim safety analysis was conducted. The analysis was not designed to review efficacy. ""This is an important and meaningful step forward on the path to better understand the Alzheimer's puzzle,"" said Phyllis Ferrell, vice president and global development leader for Alzheimer's disease at Lilly. ""We'd like to thank the AMARANTH participants and the trial investigators for taking part in this important study, and thank our colleagues at AstraZeneca for their partnership."" AZD3293 has been shown in Phase 1 studies to reduce levels of amyloid beta in the cerebro-spinal fluid of people with Alzheimer's and healthy volunteers. The progression of Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaque in the brain. BACE is an enzyme associated with the development of amyloid beta. Inhibiting BACE is expected to prevent the formation of amyloid plaque and eventually slow the progression of the disease. ""Alzheimer's disease remains one of the biggest challenges facing medical science today. BACE inhibitors have the potential to target one of the key drivers of disease progression and we are delighted that our combined efforts have resulted in the development of AZD3293 moving into the next phase of study,"" said Menelas Pangalos, executive vice president, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca. ""Disease-modifying approaches, such as this, have the potential to transform the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and help patients in this area of large unmet medical need."" Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca will receive a milestone payment from Lilly now that AZD3293 has moved into Phase 3 testing. The payment will result in a second-quarter charge of $100 million (pre-tax) to Lilly's GAAP and non-GAAP research and development expense. Lilly and AstraZeneca have also announced the planned initiation of a new Phase 3 trial for AZD3293. The trial, named DAYBREAK, will study the safety and efficacy of AZD3293 in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. DAYBREAK will begin enrolling participants in the third quarter of 2016. AstraZeneca and Lilly announced an alliance in 2014 for the development and commercialisation of AZD3293/LY3314814. Under the agreement, Lilly leads clinical development, working with researchers from AstraZeneca's Neuroscience Research and Development Team, while AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing. The companies will take joint responsibility for commercialisation of the molecule and will share all future costs equally for development and commercialisation, as well as net global revenues post-launch. About the AMARANTH study AMARANTH is a Phase 2/3 study that is investigating the safety and efficacy of AZD3293 and testing the hypothesis that it is a disease-modifying treatment for patients with early Alzheimer´s disease. Early Alzheimer's disease is defined as the continuum of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer´s disease and patients diagnosed with mild Alzheimer´s dementia. The study, which has a two-year treatment period, aims to enroll approximately 2,200 patients in 14 countries. About Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer's disease, a fatal illness, is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases.1 There are currently an estimated 46 million people living with dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to grow to more than 74 million in 2030 and 131 million in 2050.2 Only 50 percent of people with dementia ever receive a formal diagnosis,3 and Alzheimer's disease continues to be one of the most significant health challenges facing the world. The total estimated worldwide cost of dementia in 2015 was $818 billion.2 By 2018, dementia will become a trillion dollar disease, rising to $2 trillion by 2030.2 About AstraZeneca AstraZeneca is a global, innovation-driven biopharmaceutical business that focuses on the discovery, development and commercialisation of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in three main therapy areas - respiratory, inflammation, autoimmune disease (RIA), cardiovascular and metabolic disease (CVMD) and oncology – as well as in infection and neuroscience.

At the end of life, over 230,000 persons with dementia annually are cared for in hospice, yet hospice agencies are ill prepared to care for this population and often resort to inappropriate pharmacologic measures such as antipsychotics that reduce quality of life rather than improve it. This study will therefore through its two phases refine and then implement, using a pragmatic stepped wedge trial design, the Dementia Symptom Management at Home Program Hospice Edition, with the goal improving quality of care for the person with dementia and their caregiver, reducing antipsychotic use, and increasing bereaved caregiver satisfaction in the hospice setting.

There are two components to this practice intervention: 1. Provider Training, and 2. Proxy Education. Behavioral: TRAIN-AD The study intervention is a multi-component training and education program targeting direct care providers and healthcare proxies for advanced dementia NH residents, intended to improve the management of urinary and lower respiratory tract infections in advanced dementia patients. There are two components to this practice intervention: 1. Provider Training, and 2. Proxy Education. Intervention components aimed at the provider include: Professionally led infection management training seminars, online infection management course, and infection management guidance algorithms. Additionally participating prescribing providers will be sent bimonthly infection management feedback reports. Proxy Education is completed by providing an infection management in Advanced Dementia booklet to proxies of patients with AD upon resident enrollment in study. No Intervention: CONTROL Facility randomized to the control arm will employ usual care for the management for suspected infections in advanced dementia, Detailed Description: The final stage of dementia is characterized by recurrent suspected infections. Research has shown these episodes are widely mismanaged, leading to adverse patient and public health outcomes. Antimicrobials are extensively prescribed in advanced dementia, most often in the absence of clinical evidence to support a bacterial infection. Antimicrobial exposure is the main risk factor for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia are three times more likely to be colonized with MDROs compared to other residents. Moreover, as these patients are in the terminal phase of dementia, evidence suggests they may not clinically benefit from antimicrobials. Comfort is the stated goal of care for 90% of advanced dementia patients, and the risks and burdens associated with work-up and treatment of suspected infections generally do not promote that goal, particularly when hospitalization is involved. Taken together, there is a clear need to improve infection management in advanced dementia both to provide better end-of-life care to these patients and reduce the public health threat of MDROs. This is a 52-month study (8 months preparation; 36 months to conduct the trial; 8 months data analyses and manuscript preparation) of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention to improve infection management for suspected UTIs and LRIs among residents with advanced dementia (N=480; N=240/arm) living in NHs (N=24; N=12/arm). The NH is the unit of randomization as the intervention must be delivered at the facility level to avoid contamination and because this is how it would be employed in the real-world. Analyses will be at the patient level.   Eligibility 21 Years and older   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

The AMARANTH independent data monitoring committee recommended the study continue without modification after a scheduled interim safety analysis was conducted. The analysis was not designed to review efficacy. Menelas Pangalos, Executive Vice President, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, said: “Alzheimer’s disease remains one of the biggest challenges facing medical science today. BACE inhibitors have the potential to target one of the key drivers of disease progression and we are delighted that our combined efforts have resulted in the development of AZD3293 moving into the next phase of study. Disease modifying approaches, such as this, have the potential to transform the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and help patients in this area of large unmet medical need.” AZD3293 has been shown in Phase I studies to reduce levels of amyloid beta in the cerebro-spinal fluid of people with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy volunteers. The progression of Alzheimer’s disease is characterised by the accumulation of amyloid plaque in the brain. BACE is an enzyme associated with the development of amyloid beta. Inhibiting BACE is expected to prevent the formation of amyloid plaque and eventually slow the progression of the disease. Phyllis Ferrell, vice president and global development leader for Alzheimer’s disease at Lilly said: “This is an important and meaningful step forward on the path to better understand the Alzheimer’s puzzle. We’d like to thank the AMARANTH participants and the trial investigators for taking part in this important study and thank our colleagues at AstraZeneca for their partnership.” AstraZeneca and Lilly have also announced the planned initiation of a new Phase III trial for AZD3293. The trial, named DAYBREAK, will study the safety and efficacy of AZD3293 in people with mild Alzheimer’s dementia. DAYBREAK will begin enrolling participants in the third quarter of 2016. AstraZeneca and Lilly announced an alliance in 2014 for the development and commercialisation of AZD3293/LY3314814. Under the agreement, Lilly leads clinical development, working with researchers from AstraZeneca’s Neuroscience Research and Development Team, while AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing. The companies will take joint responsibility for commercialisation of the molecule and will share all future costs equally for development and commercialisation, as well as net global revenues post-launch. About the AMARANTH study AMARANTH is a Phase II/III study that is investigating the safety and efficacy of AZD3293 and testing the hypothesis that it is a disease-modifying treatment for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease. Early Alzheimer’s disease is defined as the continuum of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease and patients diagnosed with mild Alzheimer’s dementia. The study, which has a two-year treatment period, aims to enroll more than 2200 patients in 14 countries. About Alzheimer’s disease Alzheimer’s disease, a fatal illness, is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. There are currently an estimated 46 million people living with dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to grow to more than 74 million in 2030 and 131 million in 2050. Only 50 percent of people with dementia ever receive a formal diagnosis, and Alzheimer’s disease continues to be one of the most significant health challenges facing the world. The total estimated worldwide cost of dementia in 2015 was $818 billion. By 2018, dementia will become a trillion dollar disease, rising to $2 trillion by 2030.

Recruiting - verified September 2017######Assigned Interventions Provider Consented providers with prescriptive privileges will use the clinical decision software - provider portal to manage study patients with uncontrolled hypertension for 6 months. Participants will conduct a baseline face-to-face visit with study patients, access the program daily to check for patient high blood pressure alerts and lab results, conduct virtual visits as needed every 7 - 10 days, track the time and number of patients managed using the program and complete two questionnaires. Other: Clinical Decision Software - provider portal As noted in Arms Patients In a 6 month period, participants with uncontrolled hypertension will attend an initial face-to-face visit with a study provider, monitor their blood pressures 3x/week at home, enter their blood pressure readings manually or digitally into the clinical decision software - patient portal, get up to 4 blood draws, participate into up to 3 virtual visits monthly, and complete a questionnaire. Other: Clinical Decision Software - patient portal As noted in Arms Detailed Description: Current guideline directed medical therapies (GDMT) for hypertension (HTN) endorse a trial and error approach based on drug class. This pilot study will evaluate the efficacy of a Clinical Decision Support (CDS) program to assist providers with delivering a more personalized approach using individual renin-aldosterone levels and the mechanism of action of medications included in GDMT recommendations. Current research suggests underlying mechanisms of HTN can be categorized by renin and aldosterone levels into approximately 50 categories and sub-categories. Timely identification of a patients' category is challenging for clinicians and possibly a contributing factor to the low rates of HTN control reported in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 53%. The overarching goal of this study is to achieve HTN control rates above the 2014 NANES rate in a timely, cost-effective manner by individualizing medication management, thereby reducing the patient risk of stroke, heart and renal disease, and other devastating HTN-related outcomes. Specific aims are: 1) evaluate the efficacy of the CDS software program to assist providers in identifying and matching the underlying mechanisms of HTN with the mechanism of action of antihypertensive medications to achieve better HTN control rates than the 53% reported in the 2014 NHANES data, 2) assess the efficacy of the CDS program across prescribing provider levels (MD/DO, residents, and APRN/PA), and 3) Determine the impact of the CDS program on: a) medication costs, b) provider management time, c), provider and patient satisfaction with and perception of usability and efficacy of the CDS program to manage their blood pressure. This 2-phase, prospective, within-subjects, repeated measures pilot study will enroll up to 20 multi-level providers with prescriptive authority and 160 military beneficiaries with uncontrolled HTN in the Northwest to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and usability of a CDS program to improve blood pressure control over a six-month period.   Eligibility 18 Years and older   (Adult, Senior) Sexes Eligible for Study:

Detailed Description: High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major cause of heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. Natriuretic peptides are cardiac derived hormones that may protect against hypertension. The classical actions of the natriuretic peptides include natriuresis, vasodilation, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which support a key role for these hormones in blood pressure regulation. Race based differences exist in the risk and severity of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, with African-American individuals typically being at greater risk compared with white individuals. Nearly half of African-American adults have hypertension, compared with one-third of whites. Additionally, salt-sensitivity denotes the impaired ability to handle a salt load with resulting increases in blood pressure. It is estimated that 75% of hypertensive African-Americans exhibit salt-sensitivity, compared with 35% of hypertensive whites. Why this predilection towards salt-sensitivity exists, particularly among African-American individuals, is not well understood. Thus, establishing the origins of salt retention in African Americans has biologic, preventative, and therapeutic importance, and may provide insight regarding racial differences in cardiovascular risk. The natriuretic peptide system is the principal counter-regulatory mechanism to salt retention. However, little is known regarding racial differences in the natriuretic peptide system. Recently, it was discovered that African-Americans have lower natriuretic peptide levels compared with whites, raising the possibility that African-Americans individuals can have a relative ""natriuretic peptide deficiency"" with reduced natriuretic peptide responses to salt loading. However, the prior studies were based on epidemiologic data with individuals on random salt backgrounds. This highlights the need for more detailed physiologic studies, under controlled salt conditions and with standardized assessment of the natriuretic peptide and RAAS and tissue sodium stores. The aim of this study is to assess the natriuretic peptide response to dietary salt loading in African-American individuals compared with white individuals. This study will test the primary hypothesis that compared with whites, African-American individuals have blunted natriuretic peptide responses to dietary salt loading. Secondary hypotheses include: Compared with white individuals, African-American individuals have higher baseline tissue sodium content, and Compared with white individuals, African-American individuals have impaired ""target organ"" responses to salt loading, as manifested by higher blood pressure and increased frequency of salt-sensitive hypertension, decreased urinary sodium excretion, less suppression of plasma renin and serum aldosterone, and lack of increase in left ventricular early diastolic relaxation velocities.   Eligibility 18 Years to 55 Years Genders Eligible for Study:  "

The incidence rate is high and the control rate is low. Nocturnal hypertension has been paid more attention in recent years. Compared to daytime blood pressure, nocturnal blood pressure is an independent and efficient prognostic indicator of hypertensive deaths and cardiovascular events, but it's lack of evidence about its impact on prognosis in hemodialysis patients and the effective treatment program. Our previous cohort study suggests that the incidence of nocturnal hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease is up to 71.22%, with a significant increase as the decline of renal function, and more severe target organ damage in patients with nocturnal hypertension: the decrease of glomerular filtration rate, left ventricular hypertrophy, and the increase of all cause death and cardiovascular death. Our small sample size study show that night time antihypertensive drugs can better control blood pressure and delay the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. These preliminary results suggest that nocturnal hypertension is closely related to the prognosis of chronic renal disease. Taking antihypertensive drugs at night is one of the options for controlling nocturnal hypertension. However, it is not clear whether taking antihypertensive drugs at night can improve the prognosis of maintenance hemodialysis patients with nocturnal hypertension. To this end, we collect maintenance hemodialysis patients with nocturnal hypertension, and propose a time selective use of valsartan to intervene in nocturnal hypertension. By comparing the differences in the effects of valsartan on the prognosis of maintenance hemodialysis patients during the day or night, to further clarify the role of nocturnal hypertension in the prognosis of maintenance hemodialysis patients, whether controlling nocturnal hypertension can improve the prognosis of maintenance hemodialysis patients.

Condition or disease Device: sphygmomanometer Device: mobilogragh Diagnostic Test: ECG Diagnostic Test: Echocardiography Detailed Description: Many cohort studies have demonstrated that hypertension is a strong risk factor for total mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in both developing and developed countries. Although brachial blood pressure (BP) mea¬surements have been used for over a century more and more data suggest that measuring of brachial BP has important limitations. First, a few office BP readings may not be representa¬tive of BP during a patient's daily life. Second, brachial BP may differ from systolic BP mea¬sured at the level of the ascending aorta, i.e. central BP, which is responsible for left ventri¬cle afterload and determines blood flow through coronary and brain arteries . Recent data from the Strong Heart Study confirm earlier results from smaller studies on high-risk patients that central pulse pressure is superior to brachial pulse pressure in the prediction of further cardiovascular events. The results of the Conduit Artery Function Evaluation (CAFE) study reminded clinicians of the importance of CBP. Those results demonstrated significant differences in CBP (central SBP and PP) between patient groups treated with different antihypertensive regimens even though peripheral BP levels were comparably lowered, and suggested the potential superiority of CBP to cuff brachial BP in cardiovascular prognostic predictive value in hypertensive patients. Modifiable risk factors for CVD that are common among adults with hypertension include cigarette smoking/tobacco smoke exposure, DM, dyslipidemia (including high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or hypercholesterolemia, high levels of triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), overweight/obesity, physical inactivity/low fitness level, and unhealthy diet . There are clear examples around the world of ethnic variations in response to drug therapies epitomized by the benefits of thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers in lowering BP in blacks and perhaps in older people of all races, whereas blockers of the renin angiotensin system and β-adrenoceptor receptor blockers are just as effective in some other populations. Urbanization is a factor that profoundly affects BP patterns. In developed countries, hypertension is more common in rural populations than in urban. This pattern is reversed in developing, lower-, and middle-income countries where the first impact of rising rates of hypertension is seen in urban communities. Study Design Go to

Disparities in HTN prevalence, treatment and control in the US have persisted for decades. The prevalence of HTN is 44% among Blacks, which is among the highest rates in the world. Those in ethnic/racial, rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged and other medically underserved populations are known to have the worst blood pressure (BP) control. Awareness of, treatment for, and control of HTN is not optimal, and varies according to race, whereby BP is controlled in ~53% of non-Latino Whites, 42% of non-Latino Blacks and only 34% of Latinos. Fundamental underlying differences in the pathophysiology contribute to HTN among different race groups. The United States (US) 2014 HTN recommendations outline race-based pharmacotherapy care for HTN. However, these recommendations use race-based population assumptions for Whites and Blacks only, do not include Latino ethnicity and have no accompanying guidelines or tools for successful implementation, particularly in rural primary care practices where disparate populations are common. Moreover, these recommendations only apply to initial therapy and lack guidance on subsequent regimen selection. The Optimizing Precision of HTN Care to Maximize BP Control Pilot (OPTI-BP Pilot), will directly address a long known and growing health disparity concern in the US which includes higher rates of death from CHD and stroke among Blacks and the poorest rates of HTN control among Latinos. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, the overarching goal of OPTI-BP Pilot is to test, using a pragmatic trial design, a personalized, algorithmic-based HTN management approach focused on age, race, biomarker (plasma renin activity) and treatment factors. The investigators hypothesize that implementation of a precision-based approach to the care of HTN in the community will improve BP reduction and ultimately reduce risk for CHD, stroke and death among those most affected by HTN.OPTI-BP Pilot is significant because it will utilize an innovative, systematic, precision-focused HTN management approach in an underserved, diverse population where BP control is currently suboptimal and lays the infrastructure groundwork for broad implementation across all areas of the US to minimize HTN related disparities and improve HTN outcomes.

Compared with the single blood pressure measurement method of the blood pressure of the office, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) can reflect the overall situation of 24-hour blood pressure, dynamic fluctuation degree and circadian rhythm change more completely and objectively. Studies have shown that patients with CKD with hypertension have their own uniqueness through ABPM measurement, and nocturnal hypertension is the main cause of poor blood pressure control. Further studies have shown that nocturnal hypertension is an independent and more effective prognostic indicator of death and CVD in patients with hypertension. Evidence from European and American countries suggests that in the CKD population, elevated nighttime blood pressure is more predictive of CKD progression or CVD than daytime blood pressure. Compared with countries such as Europe and the United States, there are differences in the causes, genetic background and daily behaviors of kidney disease in our population. It is urgent to investigate the predictive value of nocturnal hypertension for renal end point and CVD in CKD population in China. To this end, our study found for the first time that CKD patients generally have changes in nocturnal blood pressure patterns, and the anti-dope type blood pressure pattern is closely related to the target organ damage. Our further study found that the incidence of nocturnal hypertension in Chinese patients with CKD is more than 50%, and compared with non-dipping blood pressure, patients with nocturnal hypertension have more serious target organ damage, which is independent risk factors for all-cause death, cardiovascular death, renal events, and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. These preliminary results suggest the role of nocturnal hypertension in the prognosis of CKD patients in China, but there are still the following questions: Is the occurrence of nocturnal hypertension in CKD patients related to certain gene expression? This project intends to perform whole-genome exon sequencing and analysis on CKD patients with nocturnal hypertension to determine the genetic mechanism of CKD patients with nocturnal hypertension. The completion of the subject will reveal the genetic characteristics of CKD patients with nocturnal hypertension, and provide a basis for the precise prevention and treatment of chronic kidney disease hypertension.

Recently, gut microbial dysbiosis (a term that describes a poorly diverse gut microbial profile and lower short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production) has been linked to hypertension and may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in African Americans. African Americans have been reported to have lower gut SCFA and SCFA can reduce blood pressure. Exercise reduces blood pressure and improves gut dysbiosis (increases SCFA) and likely couples' improvements in gut microbial health and vascular function to reduce blood pressure. Thus, the goals of this research are to fill a critical void concerning the interaction of gut dysbiosis, hypertension, and utilizing exercise to identify gut microbial adaptations that accompany a reduction in blood pressure. The short-term implications of this work will advance the clinical communities understanding of the relationship between dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of hypertension in African Americans, while long term implications will promote identifying adaptable gut microbes associated with vascular health to aid in amending treatment strategies for hypertension. Condition or disease Behavioral: Exercise Training effect on Hypertension and Gut Dysbiosis Not Applicable Detailed Description: African Americans (AA) have the greatest burden of hypertension and elucidating the pathogenesis of this racial disparity is important for amending treatment strategies. Gut microbial dysbiosis has been linked to hypertension and has been characterized as low microbial composition of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing microbes. Reduced gut SCFA production has been observed in AA with disease, such as glucose intolerance and vitamin deficiency, and may be related to the pathogenesis of hypertension in this group. Preliminary data show that aerobic exercise improves the gut microbial profile and increases SCFA production in animal models and humans. Additional preliminary data show that the SCFA butyrate attenuates dysfunction in AA endothelial cells suggesting a role for SCFA in endothelial/vascular function. The proposed studies have been constructed to fill a critical void in our understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension in AA involving the gut microbiome. The investigators hypothesize that lower SCFA production is associated with blood pressure in AA and exercise will be effective in reducing blood pressure by coupling improvements in gut microbial health (↑SCFA production) and vascular health. The proposed research will: 1) quantify the relationship between gut dysbiosis (reduced gut and circulating SCFA) and blood pressure in AA with hypertension and 2) quantify the impact of aerobic exercise training on gut microbial community structure, identify adaptable SCFA microbes related to blood pressure, blood concentrations of SCFA, and blood pressure in AA. The research will provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of hypertension, particularly in the health disparate AA population, and will facilitate the development of future mechanistic studies to advance the clinical communities understanding of the ""gut-vascular axis"" concerning endothelial function and vascular disease in AA.

Primary Purpose: Treatment Effect of Reducing Sedentary Behavior on Blood Pressure Resource links provided by NLM: Further study details as provided by Bethany Barone Gibbs, University of Pittsburgh: Primary Outcome Measures: Resting Systolic Blood Pressure [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Resting systolic blood pressure will be measured at baseline and follow-up using an oscillometric device after a 10-min rest on two occasions Secondary Outcome Measures: 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Ambulatory blood pressure will be measured at baseline and 3-month follow-up during a workday and overnight (24 hours total) at the beginning and end of the study. Pulse Wave Velocity [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity will be measured at baseline and follow-up following a 10-min supine rest via tonometry. Plasma Renin Activity [ Time Frame: 3 months ] PRA will be measured at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Aldosterone [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Aldosterone will be measured at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Diastolic Blood Pressure [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Resting diastolic blood pressure will be measured at baseline and follow-up using an oscillometric device after a 10-min rest on two occasions Other Outcome Measures: Weight [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Weight will be measured by digital scale at baseline and follow-up. Submaximal Cardiorespiratory Fitness [ Time Frame: 3 months ] A submaximal treadmill test will be conducted at baseline and follow-up. Glucose [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Glucose will be measured at baseline and follow-up. Insulin [ Time Frame: 3 months ] Insulin will be measured at baseline and follow-up. Estimated Enrollment: Assigned Interventions Experimental: Intervention The intervention will use behavioral strategies (self-monitoring, goal setting, problem solving, social support, stimulus control), environment modification (sit-stand attachment), and proximal (activity prompter) and distal (text messages) external prompts to target a 2-4 hour/day reduction in sedentary behavior. Behavioral: Sedentary Behavior Reduction (Intervention) The intervention will be delivered by trained research staff who are exercise physiologists or behavioral lifestyle counselors. This target reflects a recent expert statement concluding that desk-based workers should reduce workday sedentary behavior by 2-4 hr (by increasing standing and movement). Individual sedentary behavior reduction goals will be set at the baseline visit (e.g., 1-2 hr/day) and progressed biweekly at intervention contacts to reach a minimum of 2 hr/day and, ideally, 4 hr/day. The approach will combine: behavioral strategies (self-monitoring, goal setting, problem solving, social support, stimulus control), environment modification (sit-stand attachment), and proximal (activity prompter) and distal (text messages) external prompts. The initial in-person session will occur at the participant's office location. During months 2 and 3, one-on-one in-person meetings will occur at the research lab. Telephone intervention contacts will occur in the 3rd week of months 1-3. Other Name: Sedentary Behavior Reduction No Intervention: Control Participants randomized to the control condition will receive no intervention during the study. After the 3-month assessment, control participants will be provided with a wrist-worn activity monitor and will be offered the 3-month delayed intervention if desired to aid in retention and recruitment. Detailed Description: Hypertension (HTN) is the most common major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), affecting 1 in 3 American adults. Also, nearly another 1 in 3 adults has prehypertension (preHTN). Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is known to decrease BP. Guidelines recommend 150 min/week of MVPA performed in continuous bouts of ≥10 min (i.e., bouted MVPA). Sedentary behavior (SED), defined as sitting or reclining with low energy expenditure, has gained attention as a highly prevalent and distinct behavior from MVPA that is independently associated with higher BP, arterial stiffness, CVD, and mortality. These data, coupled with the fact that Americans spend more than half of the waking day in SED, suggest SED as a novel intervention target. Yet, despite heightened public perception of SED as a health risk, there is a dearth of randomized clinical trials demonstrating that SED reduction will lead to health benefits, including reduced BP. We posit that decreasing SED more substantially will improve BP, but this remains unclear in the absence of larger randomized trials with effective SED interventions. Thus, to test initial efficacy, the Effect of Reducing Sedentary Behavior on Blood Pressure (RESET-BP) has the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of our intervention targeting decreased sedentary behavior (SED) over 3 months. Outcomes include SBP (primary), DBP, ABP (nocturnal, daytime seated, daytime non-seated), and cfPWV. We hypothesize that the 3-month SED intervention will decrease SBP, DBP, ABP and cfPWV vs. controls Specific Aim 2: To explore whether renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) activation (increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone) mediates changes in BP elicited by SED reduction Specific Aim 3: To examine associations between achieved reductions in SED, increases in replacement behaviors (standing, other light-intensity physical activity (LPA), sporadic moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA)), and BP reduction These aims will be evaluated with a 2-arm, 3-month randomized trial comparing a novel SED intervention vs. control in 300 adults (150 per group). We will recruit adults with untreated pre-to-Stage I HTN and desk jobs that require prolonged SED to maximize the opportunity for SED reduction. The intervention will target currently recommended levels of SED reduction for desk-based employees (2-4 hours/day with frequent postural changes) and will use a behavioral intervention including individual in-person (1/month) and phone counselling (1/month) focused on goal setting, overcoming barriers, self-monitoring, social support, and stimulus control. In addition, the intervention will include environmental modification via provision of a sit-stand desk attachment and external prompting via text messaging and a wrist-worn inactivity prompter.   Eligibility Information from the National Library of Medicine Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.

Condition or disease Device: Suprathreshold pain stimulation Detailed Description: Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic painful, non-inflammatory rheumatic disease with a high negative impact on the quality of life, and is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue and generalised hyperalgesia on examination, symptoms that can be the consequence of central sensitization. Despite several methods have successfully addressed this increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system, there is a lack of consensus about how to systematically perform them and those that are more appropriated for different syndromes. Therefore, investigating appropriate simple methods to assess clinical manifestations of central sensitization is relevant in the assessment of fibromyalgia. The present study aims to investigate the pain response after suprathreshols pressure stimulation in fibromyalgia subjects compared with healthy volunteers. Study Design Go to  Layout table for study information Study Type : Pain Response Characteristics to Different Doses of Suprathreshold Pressure Stimulation in Fibromyalgia Subjects Actual Study Start Date : Groups and Cohorts Go to  Fibromyalgia Device: Suprathreshold pain stimulation Suprathreshold pain stimulation will be applied in the infraspinatus muscle (point equidistant between the midpoint of the spine of the scapula, the inferior angle of the scapula and the midpoint of the medial border of the scapula) with a pressure algometer (Force Ten ™, Wagner Instruments, USA). Four suprathreshold pressure stimulations (pressure pain threshold + 20%, +30%, +40% and +50%) will be made for 60 seconds, with a minimum rest of 5 minutes between each stimulation. The sequence of stimulation (ascending or descending) will be randomized. Healthy volunteers Device: Suprathreshold pain stimulation Suprathreshold pain stimulation will be applied in the infraspinatus muscle (point equidistant between the midpoint of the spine of the scapula, the inferior angle of the scapula and the midpoint of the medial border of the scapula) with a pressure algometer (Force Ten ™, Wagner Instruments, USA). Four suprathreshold pressure stimulations (pressure pain threshold + 20%, +30%, +40% and +50%) will be made for 60 seconds, with a minimum rest of 5 minutes between each stimulation. The sequence of stimulation (ascending or descending) will be randomized. Outcome Measures Go to  Primary Outcome Measures : Referred pain induced area after suprathreshold pressure stimulation [ Time Frame: Inmediately after each stimulation ] After each stimulation (120%, 130%, 140% and 150%), the subject should draw the induced pain area on a digital bodychart using the Navigate Pain application (Navigate Pain, Aalborg University, Denmark). The size of the areas of referred pain will be extracted in pixels. Secondary Outcome Measures : Pain intensity [ Time Frame: Inmediately after each stimulation ] It will be measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100 millimeters in length. The subject has to indicate the level of pain he feels, being 0 the absence of pain and 100 the maximum imaginable. Body regions afected by pain after suprathreshold pressure stimulation [ Time Frame: Inmediately after each stimulation ] The digital body chart will be divided into 15 different regions: (1) posterior head and neck area; (2) supraspinal area; (3) infraspinatus area; (4) posterior shoulder area; (5) back area; (6) posterior arm area; (7) posterior forearm area; (8) posterior hand area; (9) anterior head and neck area; (10) supraclavicular area; (11) chest area; (12) anterior shoulder area; (13) anterior arm area; (14) anterior forearm area; (15) anterior hand area.

Patients often suffer many somatic and psychological symptoms which contributes negative effect on the health- related quality of life, physical performance and physical activity. Recently, the European League Against Rheumatism presented evidence based recommendations for the management of the fibromyalgia. Accordingly, prompt diagnosis and patient education is required for optimal management. A graduated approach with the aim of improving health-related quality of life should be followed. Pharmacotherapy is only recommended for severe pain and sleep disturbances. It should focus ﬁrst on non-pharmacological modalities and the only ""strong for"" evidence-based recommendation was the use of aerobic and strengthening exercise. Aerobic exercise with moderate intensity (60 to 70% of age-adjusted predicted maximum heart rate (maxHR)) with a frequency of two or three times per week for at least 4 to 6 weeks for a reduction of symptoms is recommended in the management of fibromyalgia. Low-intensity aerobic exercise (<50 % maxHR) is founded ineffective. In recent years, high intensity interval training (HIIT) is used as popular instead of moderate intensity continuous exercise training (MICT) in cardiac rehabilitation units. It is found superior to moderate intensity exercise in improving cardiovascular fitness as increases maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). While the moderate intensity continuous aerobic exercise program lasts 30 to 60 minutes, HIIT contains 4-6 cycles of 1-4 minutes with a maximum effort and lasts approximately 20 minutes in total. Therefore, another advantage of HIIT is the need for a shorter time to achieve similar or greater effects compared to MICT. Our hypothesis is that 6 weeks of five weekly sessions of HIIT will show superior effect reducing the impact of fibromyalgia and improving pain degree, functional capacity and health-related quality of life in women with fibromyalgia compared to MICT. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effects of HIIT versus MICT on pain, functional capacity and quality of life in women with fibromyalgia.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03801109 First Posted : January 11, 2019 Last Update Posted : January 11, 2019 Information provided by (Responsible Party): University of Valencia Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a multisystem disease, characterized by generalized chronic musculoskeletal pain. In addition, there is a lot of care for fatigue, sleep disorders, morning stiffness, cognitive disorders, depression, anxiety and stress. Other common symptoms are back pain, headaches, irritable bowel, balance problems and deterioration of physical function in general. Patients with fibromyalgia (FM) often show pain at specific points that are known as ""tender spots or tender spots, with an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli"" (hyperalgesia) and a decreased pain threshold (allodynia). which can be evidenced in the physical examination and in the absence of anomalies that justify in the biological or image tests. These pain points to pressure, based on the most specific and specific criteria for the diagnosis of the disease, traditionally based on the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), according to which, should be presented so minus 11 out of 18 painful points to confirm it. Although the etiology remains unknown and unclear, its appearance is attributed to a problem of central sensitization, that is, changes in central processing, which causes an alteration of the mechanisms that regulate the sensation of pain, with amplification of nociceptive input . and perpetuation of painful stimuli. Fibromyalgia is becoming a common syndrome in the countries of Western Europe, with a prevalence in the general population that ranges between 1-3%, and specifically in Spain, around 2.4%. In addition, it has a higher incidence in women than men (73-95%), predominantly affecting women between the ages of 40-50 years. About 3% of women with fibromyalgia are at an age when menopause occurs, so not only do they experience the symptoms of both states but they even exacerbate the syndrome with each other. On the other hand, and in relation to its chronicity, the care of this type of patients involves large costs for society with a significant consumption of health resources in the field of primary care, as well as the costs of work absenteeism. For these reasons, it is considered an important problem with a great impact on the health system, and therefore more and more studies are being developed with the aim of better understanding the pathophysiology of this disease. The therapeutic approach includes low cost and easy access measures, such as physical exercise (EF) programs to improve the symptoms of FM. Physical exercise has positive effects directly on pain, joint and muscle stiffness, generalized sensitivity and fatigue, among others, and secondarily on cognitive disorders. Thus, the vast majority of studies focus on low-impact aerobic exercise, performed between 60% and 70% of the maximum heart rate two to three times a week. However, to date, there is no study that compares the effectiveness of physical exercise with other innovative therapeutic actions, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the hyperbaric chamber (HBOT), in parameters related to pain and quality of life. the life of patients with fibromyalgia. The general objective is the effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation and the hyperbaric chamber in women with fibromyalgia. As specific objectives we propose: To assess the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on quality of life in women with fibromyalgia. Object the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF in cortical functioning. Evaluate the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on fatigue. Evaluate the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on psychological aspects, such as depression and anxiety. Evaluate the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on the perception of pain and the number of painful points. Evaluate the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on the quality of sleep. Evaluate the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on the quality of life. Evaluate the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on the pain constructs. Determine the effect of HBOT, TMS and EF on plasma endorphin levels.

Magnetic group: baseline and 3 weeks ] The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The maximum total score is 63. Higher punctuations meaning, Higher scores indicate that the degree of depression is more severe Level of stress [ Time Frame: Hyperbaric, Physical and Baseline groups: baseline and 8 weeks. Magnetic group: baseline and 3 weeks ] To assess the state of stress the scale will be used the perceived srtress scale. This scale is a self-report instrument that evaluates the level of stress perceived during the last month, consists of 14 items with a response format of a scale of five points (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = from time to time). when, 3 = often, 4 = very often). The total score of the PSS is obtained by inverting the scores of items 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 13 (in the following sense: 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 and 4 = 0) and then adding the 14 items. The direct score obtained indicates that a higher score corresponds to a higher level of perceived stress.

Condition or disease Not Applicable Detailed Description: Fibromy'activ, an adapted physical activity program (APA) for patients with fibromyalgia, aims to provide lasting symptomatic relief, to favorably influence the life course, to identify mechanisms of action and to define a reproducible interdisciplinary protocol. Fibromyalgia affects at least 4% of the population. This chronic painful pathology is a source of social exclusion with a major impact on professional activity . In France, the prevalence of co-morbidities is increased in pain patients . There is a significant impact on health care systems. It is very expensive for the society of about € 7,900 / patient / year. The fibromyalgia population managed at the Center for Assessment and Treatment of Pain CHU Timone (CETD), is characterized as follows: 50 years of average age, 85% of women with children in 80% of cases. 60% have a level of education lower than the baccalaureate, less than 30% have a professional activity. The duration of the pain before the first consultation is on average 8.1 years. The SPICE score is above average which indicates a higher level of precariousness. It is associated with dysfunctional pain adjustment strategies, psychological distress, low acceptance and poor quality of life. The characteristics are close to European studies Natural evolution can lead to a total physical, psychological, social deconditioning. A link has been established between the severity of this pathology, a provider of precariousness and the poor physical condition, related to physical inactivity. The reverse has been described , so the practice of APA brings a significant reduction in symptoms . To our knowledge, no study has demonstrated with sufficient evidence the effectiveness of the practice of well-defined adapted physical activity (APA) via a reproducible program of physical activity that has been the mechanisms of action that underlie this efficacy by biology and functional brain imaging (PET CT) in this context.

Recruitment status was  Not yet recruiting Sponsor: First received: February 17, 2011 Last updated: February 17, 2011 Last verified: February 2011   Purpose Pain is one of the most common concerns for which patients seek medical attention. Pain is usually understood as symptom that reflects peripheral organic damage. Many patients experience pain, often chronically, independently of any underlying cause such as chronic regional pain syndromes (irritable bowel syndrome, temporo-mandibular pain syndrome, chronic headache or chronic low back pain)or diffuse like in fibromyalgia. In all those ""functional"" syndromes, accumulated evidence supports involvement of central pain processing systems, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axes and autonomic nervous system, and are now referred as central pain conditions. Other patients suffers from chronic pain caused by damage or inflammation in peripheral tissues, but also experienced more diffuse pain, not directly explained by peripheral damage, that further aggravates pain and function. This is illustrated by the high prevalence of fibromyalgia observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis for example. These pain conditions are now understood as combinations of peripheral, neuropathic and central pain. The investigators aimed to focus in this study in patients that are candidates to spinal surgery and suffer from low back pain and/or radiculopathy. Pain in these patients may arise from damage to nerves - neuropathic pain- , to musculoskeletal structures - peripheral pain-, and may also reflects alteration in central pain processes. In these patients, spine surgery is usually performed to improve quality of life, decrease pain and avoid neurological deficits. Evaluation of surgical outcome includes objective measures such as neurological findings and radiographic evaluation, and subjective measures including patient self-assessments for pain and quality of life and psychological changes. The aim of this study is to evaluate patients who undergo spinal surgery for presence of central pain and central sensitization symptoms and evaluate their influence on these surgical outcomes"

Condition or disease Device: Real tDCS Device: Sham tDCS Device: Therapeutic exercise Not Applicable Detailed Description: Fibromyalgia is one of the rheumatic diseases with the greatest impact on the quality of life, whose etiology and pathophysiology is not yet fully demonstrated. Perhaps this is why its therapeutic approach is refractory to current treatments. Based on the theory that fibromyalgia is characterized by a sensitization at the level of the central nervous system that leads to an increase in the perception of pain, any therapeutic approach aimed at modulating the central nervous system may be beneficial. Electrical stimulation with transcranial direct current (tDCS) is among these techniques. In the same way, therapeutic exercise has shown to have, like the tDCS, a beneficial effect on pain in different chronic pathologies. The present study aims to investigate the effect on pain of a combination therapy of tDCS and therapeutic exercise in patients with fibromyalgia.

For effective pain management, the first step should be to assess the exact status of the pain. This process may include characterizing the pain, quantifying it as accurately as possible, and analyzing influencing factors. However, it is hard to objectify pain because it is an invisible and subjective. The visual analogue scale (VAS) is widely used to assess the severity of pain. Moreover, current management of chronic pain is based on a patient's recall, which may be inaccurate. It would be ideal if we could manage pain by recording its status on a real-time basis, reflecting the impact of environmental factors. The Pain Assessment and Analysis System (PAAS) has been developed to monitor and record real-time pain. Users are asked to report the type of experienced pain and its severity. Therefore, for user convenience, PAAS can be accessed using a wearable device (Painmeter, LST, Seoul, Korea) that is interlinked with a smartphone mobile application (DrKooB-PAAS, iKooB Inc. Seoul, South Korea). The system records the frequency and severity of pain and can create reports summarizing the pain over the course of various time intervals. In addition, this system also records the time, temperature, humidity, and weather, along with the reported pain, to determine any correlations between the pain and these environmental factors. Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a complex disorder characterized by intractable, widespread pain and somatic symptoms such as insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and cognitive dysfunction. The exact pathogenesis has yet to be elucidated, but current understandings suggest that disturbances in pain-regulating neurotransmitters are involved. The diagnosis and management of FMS are a challenge for physicians. Its management should combine pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, which suggests there are various factors that influence treatment outcomes. To date, tricyclic agents, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and pregabalin are known to have beneficial effects; however, a substantial number of patients are still suffering from the uncontrolled pain of FMS. To address the pain in these patients, an appropriate pain monitoring system that can reflect real-time pain severity and frequency and can analyze the pattern of impacting factors can be used to provide effective treatment and to eventually improve patient pain. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of a real-time pain monitoring system, the Pain Assessment and Analysis System (PAAS), in patients with FMS in order to evaluate its effect on pain reduction. In addition, we evaluated the correlations between the VAS measured by PAAS and clinical parameters reflecting the disease activity of FMS. Study Design Go to

The identification and management of hypertension among patients with CKD is challenging, owing to the markedly altered patterns and rhythms of blood pressure (BP) during the 24-hour period (i.e., non-dipping status and nocturnal hypertension) and the high prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension in these individuals. Conventional BP recordings obtained in the office are reported to provide inaccurate estimates of the true BP burden assessed using out-of-office BP monitoring techniques. Self-measured BP by the patients themselves at home provides a more accurate estimate of the patient's daytime BP. Similarly to the general hypertensive population, clinical studies support the notion that among people with CKD, home BP monitoring offers several advantages over the conventional office BP recordings in diagnosing hypertension and estimating the associated cardiovascular and renal risk. Compared with office BP, home BP recordings exhibit closer association with indices of target-organ damage, such as left ventricular mass index and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). Moreover, compared with office BP, home BP recordings are stronger predictors of the rate of renal function decline over time and incident end-stage-renal-disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Importantly, home BP recordings were shown to carry stronger value relative to office BP in predicting the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The feasibility of performing repeated home BP monitoring over several days, weeks or months offers the ability to accurately assess alterations in BP levels and responses to antihypertensive therapy in the long-term. Consequently, several randomized controlled studies conducted in the general hypertensive population have provided evidence that home BP monitoring is a simple approach to guide the management of hypertension on a monthly basis. In a meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials (incorporating data from 9,446 hypertensive patients), it was shown that compared with clinic BP-based hypertension management, home BP monitoring was associated with a significantly higher reduction in systolic BP [weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.63 mmHg; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -4.24, -1.02] and in diastolic BP (WMD: -1.68 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.58, -0.79). Implementation of home BP monitoring as a tool to guide the management of hypertension was associated with more frequent reductions in the number of prescribed antihypertensive medications [relative risk (RR): 2.02; 95% CI: 1.32-3.11] and reduced the risk of therapeutic inertia, defined as unchanged antihypertensive regimen despite the presence of uncontrolled hypertension (RR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.99). In contrast to the accumulated evidence supporting the use of home BP (HBP)-guided management of hypertension in non-CKD populations, the only study to investigate the role of home BP monitoring as a tool to achieve BP targets in patients with CKD was a previous, small, randomized study enrolling 65 ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis. In this study the use of home BP monitoring for 6 months produced a significantly higher reduction in interdialytic ambulatory BP compared to conventional managements of hypertension based on routine pre-dialysis BP recordings (mean 24-hour BP at study-end: 135/76 versus 147/79 mmHg, p<0.05). Despite the fact that the use of home BP monitoring among people with hypertension and CKD is anticipated to overcome the barriers of white coat and masked hypertension effects and improve therapeutic inertia, there is still no solid evidence on the value of using this technique as a simple approach to improve BP control and maximize the associated benefits on regression of target-organ damage.

The Centers of Disease Control advocates for low sodium, senior meal plans as a strategy to lower blood pressure (BP). However, sodium is recommended to treat orthostatic hypotension (OH), a risk factor of falls. The long-term effects of low sodium intake on physical function are largely unknown in older adults. The objective of this proposed pilot study is to determine the feasibility of an individual-level, randomized feeding study that examines the impact of sodium reduction on BP regulation among 40 semi-independent, older adults aged 60 and above. Primary Aim 1: To determine the effects of a low sodium (<0.9 mg per kcal of energy intake), 2-week meal plan compared with a usual meal plan (average sodium ~2 mg per kcal of energy intake) on seated BP among independently living older adults. Hypothesis Aim 1: Compared with the usual meal plan, a reduced sodium meal plan will lower seated BP in older adults after 2 weeks. Feasibility Aim 1: To evaluate the recruitment experience, meal cost, meal delivery logistics, and compliance with and tolerability of the meal plan (urine sodium and palatability questionnaires). Feasibility Aim 2: To determine effect size (variance) of secondary outcomes: standing BP, OH (standing minus seated BP), orthostatic symptoms, and a timed up and go test (TUG). Eligible participants will be randomized to low versus usual sodium meal plans for two weeks. Assessments will be made at the in-person baseline visit, one week telephonic interview and 2 week in person follow-up visit. The primary outcome is seated BP and secondary outcomes include orthostatic hypertension and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tests. Both primary and secondary outcomes will be measured twice: (1) before the study begins (baseline), and (2) after 2 week period. Patient-reported outcomes, dietary compliance, and urine electrolytes will be assessed as well. Intent-to-treat analysis will be conducted for all endpoints.

Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Arms and Interventions Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long-term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring BP at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the present Phase I STTR study is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for adherence to these three activities with the help of mobile technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a mobile health app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens and precipitate reduction in BP. Condition or disease Behavioral: Wellth Smartphone App Behavioral: Targeted Incentives Behavioral: Non-Restricted Incentives Not Applicable Detailed Description: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mmHg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age, reaching 65% for adults over 65 years of age. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long-term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring BP at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the present Phase I STTR study is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for adherence to these three activities with the help of mobile technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a mobile health app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are adults with clinically diagnosed hypertension. The product to be developed is a mobile health app for patient smartphones, which delivers reminder triggers and immediate behavioral reinforcement through incentives to establish long-term habits. The incentives in each treatment arm are either purely financial or framed to target specific ""mental accounts"" to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The specific aims of the study are to (1) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP, and (2) Compare the effectiveness of two types of incentives, i.e., pure financial and mental accounting, on BP and adherence to all three self-care activities: medications, BP monitoring, and meal logging. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentive strategy. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for healthcare expenses for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP.

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03547856 Recruitment Status : Not yet recruiting First Posted : June 6, 2018 Last Update Posted : June 6, 2018 Information provided by (Responsible Party): Yan Li, Shanghai Institute of Hypertension Study Details Study Description Go to  Top of Page Study Description Study Design Groups and Cohorts Outcome Measures Eligibility Criteria Contacts and Locations More Information Brief Summary: 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring should be the first choice for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension according to European Societyof Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Finally, we should promote the clinical application of 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to greatly improve the management level of hypertension in China and effectively reduce the risk caused by hypertension in the population. Information of hypertensive patients with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was prospectively registered nationwide,and then to investigate whether there was difference in cardiovascular prognosis according to the control of ABP. Condition or disease Hypertension Blood Pressure Cardiovascular Diseases Detailed Description: Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease, and it is a fatal disease causing stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Effective blood pressure management can greatly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The control rate of hypertension in China is very severe. A national survey in 2002 showed that the control rate for hypertension was 6.1%. Another latest survey showed that among the 1.7 million Chinese aged 35 to 75, the detection rate of hypertension was 37 percent, among which the awareness rate and treatment rate and control rate were 36%, 23% and 6% respectively. Traditionally, BP in the office or clinic has been assessed with the auscultatory technique, which has survived to this day in clinical practice. Although the technique is inherently accurate, it is dependent on observer attention to detail, which is lacking, and it provides only a momentary measurement of BP, usually under circumstances that can influence the level of BP being measured. To overcome these serious methodology problems, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure techniques has been developed. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a major innovation in the development of hypertension diagnosis, and China has more than 20-year experience in clinical application of blood pressure monitoring. It measures blood pressure in a person's daily life and finds ""masked hypertension"", ""white coat hypertension"", ""isolated nocturnal hypertension"", ""morning hypertension"" and other special hypertension types. Compared with the office blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure can better predict the incidence of target organ damage and cardiovascular events. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring not only can accurately assess blood pressure level, but also evaluate the effect of hypertensive therapy. Therefore, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be the first choice for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Finally, we should promote the clinical application of 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to greatly improve the management level of hypertension in China and effectively reduce the risk caused by hypertension in the population. Information of hypertensive patients with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was prospectively registered nationwide,and then to investigate whether there was difference in cardiovascular prognosis according to the control of ABP.

Hypertension is the leading remediable risk factor for CVD in the U.S. and globally, with prevalence of 29% in U.S. adults. Recent data from NHANES indicate that blood pressure (BP) is not controlled, defined as <140/90 mmHg, in 48% of individuals in the U.S. with hypertension. Strategies to improve hypertension control have focused on the physician-patient interaction at the office visit, system factors in the health care provider system, and extension beyond the traditionally defined health care system. All have had some success but are limited by not reaching individuals outside the clinical encounter or by challenges of scale, scope, and standardization of blood pressure measurement outside the clinical setting. Retail outlet BP devices have the potential to address these limitations by providing free BP measurements to individuals outside the clinical setting and at all times the retail outlet is open. These automated devices are standardized and linked to software with the ability to collect data and provide information to individuals using these devices, thereby providing a platform for an intervention strategy. Higi is a privately owned company that provides health kiosks in retail outlets. Higi presently has 10,800 kiosks in the U.S. with 4,125 in Rite Aid pharmacies. More than 44 million BP measurements per year are obtained at higi kiosks. In the one-year period 7/1/15 to 6/30/16, approximately 727,000 individuals using higi kiosks recorded >3 systolic BP measurements >140/90 mmHg. The investigators propose to target this group using interactive text messaging to activate individuals to take actions to improve BP control. The primary endpoint will be BP control defined as <140/90 mmHg at 12 months post randomization. Study Design Go to

Other: Analysis of gastric juice Analysis of gastric juice including routine, biochemical and microbiological analysis. Other Name: Routine,biochemical, microbiological analysis Detailed Description: Functional dyspepsia (FD) and acid/bile reflux disease are common. These diseases share similar clinical manifestations. Individuals with functional dyspepsia (FD) often present upper abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, early satiety, loss of appetite, and no organic factors underlie it. Individuals suffering from acid/bile reflux disease often complain heartburn, upper abdominal burning or discomfort. What is more, there are always no specific changes on traditional endoscopy that can be used to differentiate these diseases (except erosive esophagitis). Though proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) test is frequently applied to confirm the diagnosis of acid reflux disease, but certain amounts of individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not show favorable response to PPI test. In order to make a distinction of these diseases, esophageal pH-metry is needed, however it is not always available in most clinics. Recent data showed that new endoscopic technology such as Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging could demonstrate indistinct lesions caused by GERD which are not detectable by standard endoscopy, subsequently improve endoscopic diagnosis of these diseases. In addition, simultaneous analysis of gastric juice can help to determine whether bile reflux is present or not. As it is known, pathologic refluxes underlie not functional dyspepsia but acid/bile reflux disease. Hence, it is hypothesized that Endoscopic Tri-Modal Imaging in combination with simultaneous analysis of gastric juice could be used to differentiate functional dyspepsia from acid/bile reflux disease.   Eligibility 18 Years to 75 Years Genders Eligible for Study:

Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter predominantly found in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin is associated with psychological disorders, including anxiety and depression, and emotion regulation and it has been shown that anxiety and depression are associated with increased severity of GERD-related symptoms. Citalopram and other SSRI's elevate the concentration of serotonin by blocking the reabsorption into the presynaptic neuron and thereby increasing the level of serotonin available to bind the postsynaptic receptor. A recent study showed beneficial effects of citalopram in patients with reflux hypersensitivity. However, there was no objective measurement for reflux nor esophageal sensitivity during the treatment period. Moreover, the effect of citalopram in patients with functional heartburn has not been studied so far. Therefore, we will conduct a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of citalopram on the improvement in symptom severity, reflux parameters and esophageal sensitivity. 50 patients with reflux hypersensitivity and 50 patients with functional heartburn will receive either placebo or citalopram (Cipramil®) 20 mg as an add-on for a period of 8 weeks. Symptom severity will be assessed by a validated reflux questionnaire (ReQuest questionnaire and diaries), reflux parameters by performing a 24 hour impedance-pH monitoring and esophageal sensitivity using our multimodal esophageal stimulation paradigm Condition or disease Study Design Go to  Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator) Primary Purpose: Treatment Official Title: A Placebo-controlled Trial With Citalopram for the Treatment of Typical Reflux Symptoms in Patients With Reflux Hypersensitivity or Functional Heartburn With Incomplete Proton Pump Inhibitor Response Estimated Study Start Date : Arms and Interventions Go to  Citalopram is taken once a day as an add-on to PPI treatment (2x/d).

Sponsor: First Posted: December 8, 2017 Last Update Posted: December 8, 2017 The safety and scientific validity of this study is the responsibility of the study sponsor and investigators. Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. Read our disclaimer for details. Information provided by (Responsible Party): Dexa Medica Group How to Read a Study Record   Purpose This is a 2-arm, prospective, double-blind double-dummy, randomized-controlled study comparing DLBS2411 at a dose of 250 mg twice daily with omeprazole at a dose of 20 mg twice daily, given before morning and evening meals, for an 8-week course of therapy. Subjects should avoid taking meals 2-3 hours before bedtime. The bioactive fraction of DLBS2411 has been proved at cellular and genetic levels to have an antiulcer effect through both suppressing the gastric acidity and enhancing gastric mucosal protection. The anti-secretory effect of DLBS2411 is exerted through the inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase 'pump' as well as down-regulation of the H+/K+ ATPase gene expression, thus suppressing gastric acid secretion; while its cytoprotective defense mechanism works through the promotion of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) derived prostaglandin (PgE2) synthesis, thus promoting gastrointestinal submucosal blood-flow, stimulating secretion of gastric-epithelial mucous and bicarbonate; anti-oxidative activity; and endothelial-nitric oxide (NO) formation. Recent study of DLBS2411 which was conducted in healthy volunteers, demonstrated the effective role and safety of DLBS2411 in suppressing intragastric acidity. Having such mechanisms of action, DLBS2411 is hypothesized to benefit patients with gastric acid disorders such as in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
